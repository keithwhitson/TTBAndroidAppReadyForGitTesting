Psalms,"1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked; nor does he stand in the way of sinners; nor does he sit in the assembly of mockers. 2 Instead, in the law of Yahweh is his delight, and on his law he meditates day and night. 3 And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of water that gives its fruit in its season; its leaf also does not wither. Therefore all that he does prospers. 4 Not so the wicked. Instead, they are like the chaff that the wind scatters. 5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous; 6 for Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.

Psalms,"1 Why are nations in tumult, and countries plotting in vain? 2 The kings of the earth establish themselves, and the rulers conspire together against Yahweh and his anointed: 3 “Let us tear off their bonds, and cast their cords from us!” 4 He who sits enthroned in the heavens laughs. The Lord derides them. 5 Then he speaks to them in his wrath, and in his fury he terrifies them: 6 “But as for me, I have set my king on Zion, my holy mountain.” 7 I will tell the decree; Yahweh said to me: “You are my son; today I have begotten you. 8 Ask from me and I will make the nations your heritage, and your possession the ends of the earth. 9 You will break them with an iron rod. Like a potter’s vessel you will shatter them.” 10 So then, O kings, be wise. Be warned, O rulers of the earth. 11 Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 12 Kiss the Son lest he be angry and you perish on the way, for his anger burns quickly. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

Psalms,"A psalm of David at his fleeing from the presence of Absalom, his son. 1 Yahweh, how many are my enemies; many are rising against me. 2 Many are saying about my soul, “There is no deliverance for him from God. Selah 3 But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory and the one who lifts up my head. 4 With my voice I call to Yahweh and he answers me from his holy hill. Selah 5 I lay down and slept; I woke up because Yahweh sustains me. 6 I am not afraid of the ten thousands of people who all around have set themselves against me. 7 Rise up, O Yahweh; deliver me, O my God; for you strike all my enemies on the cheek. The teeth of the wicked you break. 8 To Yahweh belongs deliverance; may your blessing be over your people. Selah  For the music director; with stringed instruments. A psalm of David. 1 When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness. In trouble deliver me. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer. 2 O sons of man, how long will my honor be a disgrace? How long will you love vanity? How long will you seek lies? Selah 3 But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself the faithful one. Yahweh hears when I call to him. 4 Be disturbed but do not sin. Commune in your heart on your bed and be silent. Selah 5 Offer correct sacrifices, and trust in Yahweh. 6 Many are saying, “Who will show us something good?” Lift up over us the light of your face, O Yahweh. 7 You have put gladness in my heart more than when their grain and their wine abound. 8 In peace I will lie down and sleep at once, for you alone, O Yahweh, make me dwell safely.

Psalms,"For the music director; with the flutes. A psalm of David. 1 Hear my words, O Yahweh. Give heed to my sighing. 2 Listen to the sound of my pleading, my king and my God, for to you I pray. 3 O Yahweh, in the morning you will hear my voice. In the morning I will set forth my case to you and I will watch. 4 For you are not a God who desires wickedness. Evil cannot dwell with you. 5 The boastful do not stand before your eyes. You hate all evildoers. 6 You destroy speakers of lies. A man of bloodshed and deceit Yahweh abhors. 7 But as for me, through the abundance of your steadfast love I will enter your house. I will bow down toward your holy temple in awe of you. 8 O Yahweh, lead me in your righteousness because of my enemies; make straight before me your way. 9 For there is not anything reliable in his mouth; their inner part is destruction. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongue they speak deceit. 10 Treat them as guilty, O God; let them fall because of their plans. Because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you. 11 But let all who take shelter in you rejoice. Let them ever sing for joy, because you spread protection over them; And let those who love your name exult in you. 12 For you bless the righteous. O Yahweh, like a shield you surround him with good favor.  For the music director; with stringed instruments, on the Sheminith. A psalm of David. 1 O Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger, and do not discipline me in your wrath. 2 Be gracious to me, O Yahweh, because I am feeble. Heal me, O Yahweh, for my bones are terrified. 3 My soul is also very terrified. But you, O Yahweh, how long? 4 Turn, O Yahweh; deliver my life. Save me for the sake of your steadfast love. 5 For there is no remembrance of you in death. In Sheol, who will give thanks to you? 6 I am weary with my groaning; I flood my bed every night. With my tears I drench my couch. 7 My eye wastes away because of vexation; it grows old because of all my oppressors. 8 Depart from me, all workers of evil, for Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping. 9 Yahweh has heard my plea; Yahweh has accepted my prayer. 10 All my enemies shall be ashamed and shall be very terrified. They shall turn back; they shall suddenly be ashamed.  A Shiggaion of David which he sang to Yahweh on account of Cush, a Benjaminite. 1 O Yahweh, my God, in you I have taken refuge. Save me from all who pursue me, and deliver me. 2 Or else he will tear me apart like a lion, ripping to pieces, with none to deliver. 3 O Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands, 4 if I have repaid my ally with harm, or if I have plundered my enemy without cause, 5 let the enemy of my soul pursue, and overtake and trample my life into the ground, and lay my honor in the dust. Selah 6 Rise up, O Yahweh, in your anger, and lift yourself up against the wrath of my oppressors, and awake for me, since you have commanded judgment. 7 And let the assembly of peoples surround you, and over it return on high. 8 Yahweh judges the nations. O Yahweh, vindicate me according to my innocence and according to my integrity within me. 9 Let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous, and test the hearts and innermost being, O righteous God. 10 My shield is with God who saves the upright of heart. 11 God is a righteous judge, and a God who has indignation every day. 12 If he does not repent, he will sharpen his sword. He has bent his bow and he has strung it. 13 And he has prepared for him weapons of death. He has made his arrows fiery shafts. 14 See, he travails with evil. He is pregnant with trouble, and he gives birth to deception. 15 He makes a pit and digs it out, then falls in the trap he has made. 16 His trouble comes back on his head, and his violence comes down on his skull. 17 I will thank Yahweh according to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of Yahweh, the Most High.

Psalms,"For the music director, on the Gittith. A psalm of David. 1 Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth, who put your splendor above the heavens. 2 From the mouth of children and infants you have founded strength on account of your enemies, to silence the enemy and the avenger. 3 When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you set in place— 4 what is a human being that you think of him? and a child of humankind that you care for him? 5 And you made him a little lower than heavenly beings, and with glory and with majesty you crowned him. 6 You make him over the works of your hands; all things you have placed under his feet: 7 sheep and cattle, all of them, and also the wild animals of the field, 8 the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea, everything that passes along the paths of seas. 9 Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all of the earth!

Psalms,"A miktam of David. 1 Protect me, O God, for I take refuge in you. 2 Oh my soul you have said to Yahweh, “You are my Lord. I have no good apart from you.” 3 With regard to the saints who are in the land, they are the noble ones in whom is all my desire. 4 Those who hurry after another god increase their sorrows. I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood, nor take up their names on my lips. 5 Yahweh is the portion which is my share and my cup. You hold my lot. 6 The measuring lines have fallen for me in pleasant places. Yes, my inheritance is delightful for me. 7 I will bless Yahweh who advises me; yes, at night my innermost being instructs me. 8 I have set Yahweh before me always. Because he is at my right hand I will not be shaken. 9 Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices. Yes, my body will dwell in safety, 10 for you will not abandon my soul to Sheol; you will not give your faithful one to see the grave. 11 You will make known to me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. At your right hand are pleasures forever.  A prayer of David. 1 O Yahweh, hear a just cause. Hear my cry; heed my prayer I make without deceitful lips. 2 Let my vindication come forth from you; let your eyes see fairness. 3 You have tried my heart; you have examined me by night; you have tested me; you found nothing. I have decided that my mouth will not transgress. 4 As for the works of humankind, by the word of your lips, I have kept from the ways of the violent. 5 I have held my steps in your path My feet will not slip. 6 As for me, I have called on you because you will answer me, O God. Incline your ear to me. Hear my words. 7 Show wondrously your acts of loyal love, O Savior of those who take refuge at your right hand from those who rise up against them. 8 Keep me as the apple of your eye. Hide me in the shadow of your wings 9 from the presence of the wicked who destroy me, those enemies against my life, they that surround me. 10 They have shut off their calloused heart; with their mouth they speak arrogantly. 11 Now they surround us at our every step. They intend to pin me to the ground. 12 He is like a lion; he longs to tear apart, and like a strong lion crouching in hiding places. 13 Rise up, O Yahweh, confront him. Make him bow down. Rescue with your sword my life from the wicked, 14 from men by your hand, O Yahweh, from men of this world. Their share is in this life, and you fill their stomach with your treasure. They are satisfied with children. They bequeath their excess to their children. 15 By contrast, I in righteousness shall see your face. Upon awakening I will be satisfied seeing your form.

For the music director. Of David, the servant of Yahweh, who spoke to Yahweh the words of this song when Yahweh delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. 1 And he said: “I love you, O Yahweh, my strength.” 2 Yahweh is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock in whom I have taken refuge, my shield and the horn of my deliverance, my stronghold. 3 I called upon Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised, and I was saved from my enemies. 4 The ropes of death encircled me, and streams of ruin overwhelmed me. 5 The ropes of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me. 6 In my trouble I called on Yahweh, and to my God I cried for help. He heard my voice from his temple, and my cry for help came up before his presence into his ears. 7 Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains trembled, and they staggered because he was angry. 8 Smoke went forth from his nose, and fire from his mouth consumed. Burning coals blazed from him. 9 So he bowed the heavens and came down with a thick cloud under his feet. 10 And he mounted a cherub and flew, and he swooped down on wings of wind. 11 He made darkness his hiding place; all about him his covering was a darkness of waters, thick clouds. 12 From the brightness before him his clouds passed over with hail and coals of fire. 13 And Yahweh thundered from the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice with hail and coals of fire. 14 And he shot his arrows and scattered them, and many lightning bolts and routed them. 15 Then the channels of the sea became visible, and the foundations of the world were uncovered by your rebuke, O Yahweh, by the blast of the wind of your nose. 16 He reached from on high; he seized me. He drew me from many waters. 17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me because they were stronger than I. 18 They confronted me on the day of disaster, but Yahweh was my support. 19 So he brought me out to a spacious place. He delivered me because he delighted in me. 20 Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands he has repaid me. 21 Because I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not acted wickedly against my God, 22 because all his ordinances are before me, and his statutes I have not removed from me, 23 and I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from my guilt. 24 Therefore Yahweh has repaid me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. 25 To the loyal you show yourself loyal. To the blameless you show yourself blameless. 26 To the pure you show yourself pure. but to the wicked you show yourself shrewd. 27 For you deliver humble people, but haughty eyes you humiliate. 28 For you light my lamp; Yahweh, my God, lights up my darkness. 29 For with you I can charge a troop, and with my God I can scale a wall. 30 This God—his way is blameless. The word of Yahweh is flawless. He is a shield for all those who take refuge in him. 31 For who is God apart from Yahweh, and who is a rock except our God? 32 The God who girded me with strength, and made safe my way, 33 he made my feet like the deer’s, and on my high places he makes me stand. 34 He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. 35 You also gave me the shield of your salvation, and your right hand supported me, and your humility made me great. 36 You enlarged my step under me, and my ankles did not slip. 37 I chased my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back until they were finished off. 38 I struck them and they were not able to stand up; they fell under my feet. 39 And you girded me with strength for the battle; those rising against me you made to kneel under me. 40 And you made my enemies turn their backs, then I destroyed those who hated me. 41 They cried out but there was no rescuer, even to Yahweh, but he did not answer them. 42 And I ground them like dust in the wind, I emptied them out like mud of the streets. 43 You rescued me from strife with people; you set me as head (over) nations. People I did not know served me; 44 as soon as they heard, they obeyed me. The children of a foreign land feigned obedience before me. 45 The children of a foreign land lost heart, and they came trembling from their strongholds. 46 Yahweh lives, and blessed be my rock, and may the God of my salvation be exalted— 47 the God who executed vengeance for me, and subdued peoples under me, 48 who delivered me from my enemies. Indeed, you exalted me higher than those who rose against me. You delivered me from the man of violence. 49 Therefore I will give thanks to you among the nations, O Yahweh, and I will sing the praise of your name: 50 the one who makes great victories for his king, and who shows loyal love for his anointed, to David and to his descendants forever.

Psalms,"For the music director. A psalm of David. 1 The heavens are telling the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands. 2 Every day they pour forth speech, and every night they tell knowledge. 3 There is no speech and there are no words; their sound is inaudible. 4 Yet in all the world their line goes out, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has pitched a tent for the sun, 5 and it is like a bridegroom who comes out of his bridal chamber. It is glad like a strong man to run its course. 6 Its rising is from one end of the heavens and its circuit to the other end of them; and nothing is hidden from its heat. 7 The law of Yahweh is perfect, reviving life. The testimony of Yahweh is firm, making wise the simple. 8 The precepts of Yahweh are right, making the heart rejoice. The command of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes. 9 The fear of Yahweh is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of Yahweh are true; they are righteous altogether, 10 more desirable than gold, even much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, even honey in the comb. 11 Moreover, your servant is warned by them; in keeping them is great reward. 12 Who can perceive his errors? Acquit me from hidden faults. 13 Also, keep back your servant from arrogant sins; let them not rule over me. Then I shall be blameless, and I shall be innocent of great transgression. 14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your presence, O Yahweh, my rock and my redeemer.  For the music director. A psalm of David. 1 May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble. May the name of Jacob’s God protect you. 2 May he send you help from the sanctuary, and from Zion may he sustain you. 3 May he remember all your offerings, and your burnt offering may he regard favorably. Selah 4 May he give to you your heart’s desire, and your every plan may he fulfill. 5 May we shout for joy over your victory, and in the name of our God may we set up banners. May Yahweh fulfill all your requests. 6 Now I know that Yahweh will help his anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven with the victorious power of his right hand. 7 Some boast in chariots and others in horses, but we boast in the name of Yahweh, our God. 8 They will collapse and fall, and we will rise and stand firm. 9 Rescue, O Yahweh. Let the king answer us when we call.

Psalms,"For the music director.

You set on his head a crown of fine gold. 4 He asked life from you; you gave it to him— length of days forever and ever. 5 His honor is great because of your help. Splendor and majesty you have bestowed upon him. 6 For you set on him blessings forever. You make him glad with the joy of your presence. 7 Because the king trusts Yahweh, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved. 8 Your hand will find all your enemies; your right hand will find those who hate you. 9 You will make them like your fiery furnace at the time of your appearance. Yahweh will swallow them in his wrath and fire will consume them. 10 You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their descendants from among the children of humankind. 11 Though they have plotted evil against you, though they have planned a scheme, they will not prevail. 12 For you will turn them to flight; you will aim arrows on your bowstrings at their faces. 13 Be exalted, O Yahweh, in your strength, and we sing and praise your power.

From my mother’s belly you have been my God. 11 Do not be far from me because trouble is near; because there is no helper. 12 Many bulls have encircled me; mighty bulls of Bashan have surrounded me. 13 They open their mouth against me like a lion tearing and roaring. 14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax; it is melted within me. 15 My strength is dry like a potsherd, and my tongue is sticking to my jaws; and you have placed me in the dust of death. 16 Because dogs have surrounded me; a gang of evildoers has encircled me. Like the lion they are at my hands and my feet. 17 I can count all my bones; they gaze, they look at me. 18 They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots. 19 But you, O Yahweh, do not remain distant. O my help, hasten to help me. 20 Rescue my life from the sword, my only life from the power of the dogs. 21 Save me from the mouth of the lion, and from the horns of the wild oxen answer me. 22 I will tell your name to my brothers; inside the assembly I will praise you. 23 You who revere Yahweh, praise him! Glorify him, all you seed of Jacob, and be in awe of him, all you seed of Israel, 24 because he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, and has not hid his face from him; but he listened to him when he cried for help. 25 From you is my praise.

Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 5 You prepare before me a table in the presence of my oppressors. You anoint my head with oil; my cup is overflowing. 6 Surely goodness and loyal love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will stay in the house of Yahweh for a very long time.  A psalm of David. 1 The earth is Yahweh’s, with its fullness, the world and those who live in it, 2 because he has founded it on the seas, and has established it on the rivers. 3 Who may ascend the mountain of Yahweh? And who may stand in his holy place? 4 He who is innocent of hands and pure of heart, who does not lift up his soul to falseness, and does not swear deceitfully. 5 He will receive blessing from Yahweh, and justice from the God of his salvation. 6 Such is the sort of those who seek him, those who seek your face, even Jacob. Selah 7 Lift up your heads, O gates, and rise up, O ancient doorways, that the king of glory may enter. 8 Who is the king of glory? Yahweh, strong and mighty; Yahweh, mighty in war! 9 Lift up your heads, O gates, and lift up, O ancient doorways, that the king of glory may enter. 10 Who is the king of glory? Yahweh of hosts, He is the king of glory!

Psalms,"1 To you, O Yahweh, I lift up my soul. 2 O my God, I trust you; let me not be put to shame. Do not let my enemies exult over me. 3 Indeed, none who wait for you should be put to shame. Those who betray without cause should be put to shame. 4 Make me know your ways, O Yahweh. Teach me your paths. 5 Cause me to walk in your truth and teach me, because you are the God of my salvation. I await you all day long. 6 Remember your compassion, O Yahweh, and your acts of loyal love, because they are from of old. 7 Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions. According to your loyal love remember me if you will, for the sake of your goodness, O Yahweh. 8 Good and right is Yahweh; therefore he instructs sinners in the way. 9 He causes the humble to walk in justice, and teaches the humble his way. 10 All the paths of Yahweh are loyal love and faithfulness for those who keep his covenant and statutes. 11 Also, for the sake of your name, O Yahweh, forgive my sin, because it is great. 12 Who is the man fearing Yahweh? He will instruct him in the way he should choose. 13 His soul will lodge in prosperity, and his offspring will possess the land. 14 Intimate fellowship with Yahweh is for those who fear him, and he makes known his covenant to them. 15 My eyes are continually toward Yahweh, because he will take my feet from the net. 16 Turn to me and have mercy on me because I am lonely and afflicted. 17 Remove the troubles of my heart; bring me out from my distresses. 18 Consider my affliction and trouble, and forgive all my sins. 19 Consider that my enemies are many, and they hate me with violent hatred. 20 Protect my life and deliver me. Let me not be put to shame, because I take shelter in you. 21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, because I wait for you. 22 O God, redeem Israel from all its troubles.  Of David. 1 Judge me, O Yahweh, because I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted Yahweh and not wavered. 2 Prove me, O Yahweh, and test me. Try my innermost being and my mind. 3 Because your loyal love is before my eyes, and I walk about in your faithfulness. 4 I do not sit with deceitful people, nor will I go about with hypocrites. 5 I hate the crowd of evildoers, and with the wicked I will not sit. 6 I will wash my hands in innocence, and I will walk about your altar, O Yahweh, 7 to declare with a voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all your wondrous deeds. 8 O Yahweh, I love the dwelling of your house, and the place where your glory abides. 9 Do not destroy me with the sinners, nor my life with men of bloodshed, 10 in whose hands is an evil plan, and whose right hand is full of bribes. 11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me and be gracious to me. 12 My foot stands on level ground. In assemblies I will bless Yahweh.  Of David. 1 Yahweh is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?

Psalms,"Of David. 1 Yahweh is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? Yahweh is the refuge of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 2 When evildoers drew near against me to eat my flesh— my adversaries and my enemies who drew near to me— they themselves stumbled and fell. 3 Though an army encamp against me, my heart will not fear. Though war arise against me, even in this I will remain confident. 4 One thing I have asked from Yahweh; it I will seek: that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Yahweh, and to consider his temple. 5 Because he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble. He will conceal me in the hiding place of his tent. He will set me high upon a rock. 6 And now my head will be high over my enemies round about me. And I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh. 7 Hear, O Yahweh, my voice when I call, and be gracious to me and answer me. 8 On your behalf my heart says, “Seek my face.” Your face, O Yahweh, I do seek. 9 Do not hide your face from me; do not turn your servant away in anger. You have been my help; do not abandon nor forsake me, O God of my salvation. 10 If my father or my mother forsake me, then Yahweh will receive me. 11 Teach me, O Yahweh, your way, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies. 12 Do not give me over to the desire of my enemies, because false witnesses have arisen against me, and each breathing out violence. 13 Surely I believe that I will see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living. 14 Wait for Yahweh. Be strong and let your heart show strength, and wait for Yahweh.  A psalm of David. 1 To you, O Yahweh, I call. O my rock, do not be deaf to me. Or else, if you are silent to me, then I will become like those descending to the pit. 2 Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to you for help, when I lift up my hands toward your holy inner sanctuary. 3 Do not drag me away with the wicked or with the workers of evil, who speak of peace with their neighbors, while evil is in their heart. 4 Give to them according to their work, even according to the evil of their deeds. Give to them according to the work of their hands; repay them their rightful due. 5 Because they do not regard the works of Yahweh, nor the work of his hands, he will destroy them and not rebuild them. 6 Blessed is Yahweh, because he has heard the voice of my supplications. 7 Yahweh is my strength and my shield. My heart trusts him and I am helped. So my heart rejoices, and with my song I will give thanks to him. 8 Yahweh is their strength, and he is the refuge for the salvation of his anointed one. 9 Save your people and bless your heritage. Shepherd them also and carry them always.

Psalms,"A psalm of David. 1 Ascribe to Yahweh, O sons of God, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength. 2 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due his name. Worship Yahweh in holy array. 3 The voice of Yahweh is over the waters; the God of glory thunders. Yahweh is over many waters. 4 The voice of Yahweh is powerful. The voice of Yahweh is majestic. 5 The voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars. Yahweh shatters even the cedars of Lebanon. 6 And he makes them skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox. 7 The voice of Yahweh flashes flames of fire. 8 The voice of Yahweh shakes the wilderness. Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. 9 The voice of Yahweh causes deer to give birth and strips the forests bare. And at his temple all in it say, “Glory!” 10 Yahweh sits enthroned at the flood, and Yahweh sits as king forever. 11 May Yahweh give strength to his people. May Yahweh bless his people with peace.  A psalm; a song for the dedication of the house. Of David. 1 I will exalt you, O Yahweh, because you have drawn me up, and have not made my enemies rejoice over me. 2 O Yahweh, my God, I cried for help to you, and you healed me. 3 O Yahweh, you have brought my life up from Sheol. You preserved me alive from among those going down to the pit. 4 Sing praises to Yahweh, you his faithful ones, and give thanks to his holy fame. 5 For there is a moment in his anger; there is a lifetime in his favor. Weeping lodges for the evening, but in the morning comes rejoicing. 6 But as for me, I had said in my prosperity, “I shall not be moved ever.” 7 O Yahweh, by your favor you caused my strong mountain to stand. You hid your face. I was bewildered. 8 To you, O Yahweh, I called, and to the Lord I pleaded for grace saying, 9 “What gain is there in my death, in my going down into the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it tell of your faithfulness? 10 “O Yahweh, hear and be gracious to me. O Yahweh, be my helper.” 11 You have turned my wailing into my dancing.

A psalm of David. 1 In you, O Yahweh, I have taken refuge. Let me not be put to shame ever. Deliver me by your righteousness. 2 Incline your ear to me. Quickly deliver me. Become my rock of refuge, a fortified keep to save me. 3 For you are my rock and my fortress. So, for the sake of your name, lead me and guide me. 4 Bring me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, for you are my refuge. 5 Into your hand I commit my spirit. You have redeemed me, O Yahweh, faithful God. 6 I hate those devoted to useless idols, but I trust Yahweh. 7 I will exult and rejoice in your loyal love. Because you have seen my misery, you know the distresses of my life. 8 And you have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy. You have set my feet in a broad place. 9 Be gracious to me, O Yahweh, because I have distress. My eye wastes away because of vexation, along with my soul and my body. 10 For my life is at an end with sorrow, and my years with sighing. My strength stumbles because of my iniquity, and my bones waste away. 11 Because of all my adversaries I have become a disgrace, especially to my neighbors, and a dread to my acquaintances. Those who see me in the street flee from me. 12 I have become forgotten like one dead, out of mind. I am like a destroyed vessel. 13 For I hear the rumor of many, “Terror on every side!” When conspiring together against me, they have plotted to take my life. 14 But as for me, I trust you, O Yahweh. I say, “You are my God.” 15 My times are in your hand. Deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those who pursue me. 16 Shine your face upon your servant. Save me by your loyal love. 17 O Yahweh, let me not be put to shame, for I call on you. Let the wicked be put to shame. Let them go silently to Sheol. 18 Let lying lips be dumb, that speak against the righteous unrestrained with arrogance and contempt. 19 How abundant is your goodness that you have stored up for those who fear you, that you perform for those who take refuge in you before the children of humankind. 20 You will hide them in the protection of your presence from the plots of man. You will hide them in a shelter from the strife of tongues. 21 Blessed is Yahweh, because he has worked marvelously his loyal love to me in a besieged city. 22 As for me, I said in my alarm, “I am cut off from before your eyes.” However you heard the voice of my supplications when I cried to you for help. 23 Love Yahweh, all you his faithful ones.

Psalms,"Of David. A maskil. 1 Happy is he whose transgression is taken away, whose sin is covered. 2 Happy is a person to whom Yahweh does not impute iniquity and in whose spirit there is not deceit. 3 When I kept silent, my bones were worn out due to my groaning all the day. 4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me. My vigor was changed into the dry heat of summer. Selah 5 I made known my sin to you, and my iniquity I did not cover. I said, “I will confess concerning my transgressions to Yahweh,” and you took away the guilt of my sin. Selah 6 Therefore let all the faithful pray to you at the time for finding you. Surely at the flood of many waters they will not reach him. 7 You are my hiding place; from trouble you preserve me. With cries of deliverance you surround me. Selah 8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way that you should go. I will advise you with my eye upon you. 9 Do not be like a horse or like a mule, without understanding; that needs his tackle—bridle and rein—for restraint or he would not come near you. 10 Many are the pains of the wicked, but for the one who trusts Yahweh loyal love surrounds him. 11 Be glad in Yahweh and rejoice, you righteous, and shout for joy, all you upright of heart. 1 Exult in Yahweh, O you righteous, for praise is fitting for the upright. 2 Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre; with a harp of ten strings play to him. 3 Sing to him a new song; play skillfully with jubilant shout. 4 For the word of Yahweh is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness. 5 He loves righteousness and justice. The earth is full of the loyal love of Yahweh. 6 By the word of Yahweh the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host. 7 He gathered the waters of the sea like a heap. He put the deeps in storehouses. 8 Let all the earth fear Yahweh. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 9 For he himself spoke and it came to pass. He himself commanded and it stood firm. 10 Yahweh brings to nothing the plan of nations; he frustrates the intents of peoples. 11 The plan of Yahweh stands firm forever, the intents of his heart from one generation to the next. 12 Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh, the people he has chosen for his inheritance. 13 From heaven Yahweh looks; he sees all the children of humankind. 14 From his dwelling place he gazes on all the inhabitants of the earth, 15 he who fashions altogether their heart, he who understands all their works. 16 The king is not saved by the greatness of an army. The warrior is not delivered by the greatness of strength. 17 The horse is a false hope for victory, nor can it save by the greatness of its power. 18 Behold, the eye of Yahweh is on those who fear him, on those who hope for his loyal love 19 to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine. 20 Our soul waits for Yahweh; he is our help and our shield. 21 For in him our heart rejoices because in his holy name we trust. 22 Let your loyal love, O Yahweh, be upon us, even as we hope in you.

Psalms,"Of David, when he pretended to be crazy in front of Abimelech so that he drove him out, and so he departed. 1 I will bless Yahweh at all times; his praise shall be in my mouth continually. 2 My soul makes its boast in Yahweh; let the humble hear and be glad. 3 Magnify Yahweh with me, and let us exalt his name together. 4 I sought Yahweh and he answered me, and from all my terrors he delivered me. 5 They looked to him and were radiant, and their faces shall not be ashamed. 6 This poor man called and Yahweh heard, and saved him from all his troubles. 7 The angel of Yahweh encamps around those who fear him, and he rescues them. 8 Taste and see that Yahweh is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him. 9 Fear Yahweh, you his saints, for there is no lack for those who fear him. 10 The young lions are in want and suffer hunger, but those who seek Yahweh will not lack for any good thing. 11 Come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of Yahweh. 12 Who is the man who desires life, who loves many days in order to see good? 13 Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. 14 Turn from evil and do good. Seek peace and pursue it. 15 The eyes of Yahweh are toward the righteous, and his ears toward their cry for help. 16 The face of Yahweh is against evildoers, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 17 They cry out and Yahweh hears and delivers them from all of their troubles. 18 Yahweh is near to those who are heartbroken and saves those who are crushed in spirit. 19 Many are the distresses of the righteous, but Yahweh delivers him out of them all. 20 He protects all his bones; not one of them is broken. 21 Evil will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will incur guilt. 22 Yahweh redeems the life of his servants, and none who take refuge in him will incur guilt. Of David. 1 Contend, O Yahweh, with my contenders; fight those who fight me. 2 Grasp buckler and shield and rise to my aid. 3 And draw the spear and javelin to meet those who pursue me. Say to my soul, “I am your salvation.” 4 Let those who seek my life be shamed and humiliated. Let those who plot calamity against me be repulsed and ashamed. 5 Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of Yahweh driving them. 6 Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of Yahweh pursuing them. 7 For without cause they secretly hide the pit with their net for me; without cause they dug it for my life. 8 Let unforeseen ruin come on him, and his net that he hid, let it catch him. Let him fall into it in ruin. 9 Then my soul will rejoice in Yahweh; it will rejoice in his salvation. 10 All of my bones shall say, “O Yahweh, who is like you, who delivers the poor from one stronger than he and the poor and needy from the one who robs him?” 11 Violent witnesses rise up; they ask me concerning what I do not know. 12 They repay me evil in place of good. It is bereavement to my soul. 13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth. I weakened my soul with fasting, and my prayer returned to me unanswered. 14 I behaved as though he were a friend or as a brother to me. As one lamenting a mother, I was bowed down in mourning. 15 But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered together; smiters whom I did not know gathered against me. They tore and did not cease. 16 Among the ungodly of the mockers at feasts, they gnashed at me with their teeth. 17 My Lord, how long will you watch? Restore my life from their ravages, my only life from the young lions. 18 I will give thanks to you in the great assembly; among the mighty people I will praise you. 19 Let not those who are wrongfully my enemies rejoice over me. Nor let those who hate me without cause wink the eye. 20 For they do not speak peace, but against the quiet ones of the land they plan deceitful words. 21 They also made wide their mouths against me. They said, “Aha! Aha! Our eyes have seen it.” 22 You have seen, O Yahweh. Do not be deaf. O Lord, do not be far from me. 23 Wake up and rouse yourself for my right, for my cause, O my God and my Lord. 24 Vindicate me according to your righteousness, O Yahweh my God, and do not let them rejoice over me. 25 Do not let them say in their hearts, “Aha, our desire.” Let them not say, “We have swallowed him up.” 26 Let them be shamed and abashed altogether, who rejoice at my misfortune. Let them put on shame and insult, who magnify themselves against me. 27 Let them shout for joy and be glad, who delight in my vindication; and let them say continually, “Yahweh is great, who delights in the welfare of his servant.” 28 Then my tongue will proclaim your righteousness, and your praise all day.

Psalms,"For the music director. Of David, the servant of Yahweh. 1 An oracle: the wicked has rebellion in the midst of his heart. There is no fear of God before his eyes. 2 For he flatters himself in his eyes, hating to detect his iniquity. 3 The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit. He has ceased to have insight and to do good. 4 He plans sin on his bed. He puts himself on a way that is not good. He does not reject evil. 5 O Yahweh, your loyal love extends into the heavens, your faithfulness unto the clouds. 6 Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your judgments like the great deep. You save man and beast, O Yahweh. 7 How precious is your loyal love, O God, and the children of humankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings. 8 They are refreshed with the fullness of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights. 9 For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light. 10 Prolong your loyal love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright of heart. 11 Do not let a foot of pride come against me, nor let a wicked hand make me to wander homeless. 12 There doers of evil have fallen; they are thrust down and not able to rise. Of David. 1 Do not fret because of evildoers; do not be envious of doers of wickedness. 2 For like the grass they will dry up quickly, and like green vegetation they will wither. 3 Trust Yahweh and do good. Abide in the land and feed on faithfulness. 4 Take pleasure in Yahweh as well, and he will give to you the requests of your heart. 5 Commit to Yahweh your way; Trust also on him and he will act. 6 Then he will bring forth your righteousness like the light, and your justice like the noonday. 7 Be quiet before Yahweh and wait for him. Do not fret about one who succeeds in his way, about a man making plots. 8 Refrain from anger and forsake wrath. Do not fret; it only brings evil. 9 For evildoers will be cut off, but those who wait for Yahweh— they will possess the land. 10 And yet a little while and the wicked will not be, and you will look carefully upon his place, but he will not be. 11 But the afflicted will possess the land, and they will take pleasure in an abundance of peace. 12 The wicked plans evil against the righteous, and gnashes at him with his teeth. 13 The Lord laughs at him, for he sees that his day is coming. 14 The wicked have drawn the sword and have bent their bow to throw down the poor and the needy, to kill those upright in their way. 15 Their sword will enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. 16 The little belonging to the righteous is better than the wealth of many wicked. 17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Yahweh supports the righteous. 18 Yahweh knows the days of the blameless, and their inheritance will be forever. 19 They will not be put to shame in distressing times, and in the days of famine they will be satisfied. 20 But the wicked will perish, and the enemies of Yahweh will be like the splendor of the pastures. They vanish; in smoke they vanish. 21 The wicked borrows and does not repay, but the righteous is gracious and gives. 22 For those blessed by him shall possess the land, but those cursed by him shall be cut off. 23 The steps of a man are established by Yahweh, and he takes pleasure in his way. 24 Though he fall, he will not be cast headlong, for Yahweh supports him with his hand. 25 I was a youth, but I am now old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread. 26 All the day he is gracious and lends, and his children are a blessing. 27 Turn aside from evil and do good and so abide forever. 28 For Yahweh loves justice and will not forsake his faithful ones. They are protected forever. But the children of the wicked will be cut off. 29 The righteous will possess the land and abide in it forever. 30 The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice. 31 The law of his God is in his heart. His steps will not slip. 32 The wicked watches for the righteous and seeks to kill him. 33 Yahweh will not abandon him into his hand, and he will not let him be condemned when he is judged. 34 Wait for Yahweh and keep his way, and he will exalt you to possess the land. When the wicked are cut off, you will see it. 35 I have seen the wicked acting violently and spreading himself out like a luxuriant native tree. 36 Then he passed on and behold, he was not. And I sought him, but he could not be found. 37 Observe the blameless and look at the upright, for there is a future for a man of peace. 38 But transgressors shall be destroyed altogether. The future of the wicked shall be cut off. 39 And the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh, their refuge in the time of trouble. 40 And Yahweh helps them and he rescues them. He rescues them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him. A psalm of David. To bring to remembrance. 1 O Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger or chastise me in your wrath. 2 For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has pressed down on me. 3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation. There is no health in my bones because of my sin. 4 For my iniquities have passed over my head; like a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. 5 My wounds start to stink; they rot because of my foolishness. 6 I am bowed down; I am bent over greatly. All the day I go about mourning. 7 For my loins are full of burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh. 8 I am faint and crushed greatly; I groan because of the roaring of my heart. 9 O Lord, all my longing is before you, and my sighing is not hidden from you. 10 My heart throbs violently, my strength leaves me; and the light of my eyes, that also is not with me. 11 My friends and companions stand aloof from my affliction, and my relatives stand afar off. 12 Those who seek my life lay snares as well, and those intent on my harm speak threats. They also plot deceit all day. 13 But as for me, like the deaf I cannot hear, and I am like the mute who cannot open his mouth. 14 And so I am like a man who hears not, and in whose mouth there are no retorts. 15 Rather for you I wait, O Yahweh. You will answer, O Lord my God. 16 For I said, “Help, lest they rejoice over me, lest they boast against me when my foot slips.” 17 For I am ready to stumble, and my pain is before me continually. 18 For my iniquity I confess; I am anxious because of my sin. 19 And my enemies without cause are numerous, and those who hate me wrongfully are many. 20 And those who repay evil in return for good accuse me in return for my pursuing good. 21 Do not forsake me, O Yahweh. O my God, do not be far from me. 22 Hurry to help me, O Lord, my salvation.

Psalms,"For the music director. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David. 1 I said, “I will guard my ways that I may not sin with my tongue. I will keep a muzzle over my mouth as long as the wicked are before me.” 2 I was mute with silence. I was silent even from saying good things, and my pain was stirred up. 3 My heart grew hot inside me; in my sighing a fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue, 4 “Let me know, O Yahweh, my end, and what is the measure of my days. Let me know how transient I am.” 5 Look, you have made my days mere handbreadths, and my lifespan as nothing next to you. Surely every person standing firm is complete vanity. Selah 6 Surely a man walks about as a mere shadow; surely in vain they bustle about. He heaps up possessions but does not know who will gather them in. 7 And now, O Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is for you. 8 From all my transgressions deliver me; do not make me the taunt of the fool. 9 I am mute. I do not open my mouth, for you, yourself, have done it. 10 Remove from me your affliction. By the opposition of your hand I perish. 11 When with rebukes you chastise a man for sin, you consume like a moth his delightful things. Surely everyone is a mere vapor. Selah 12 Hear my prayer, O Yahweh, and listen to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my tears. For I am an alien with you, a sojourner like all my ancestors. 13 Look away from me that I may be cheerful, before I depart and I am no more. For the music director. Of David. A psalm. 1 I waited patiently for Yahweh, And he inclined to me and heard my cry for help. 2 And so he brought me up from the roaring pit, from the miry clay. And he put my feet upon a rock; he made my steps steady. 3 Then he put a new song in my mouth, a praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and will trust Yahweh. 4 Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust and does not turn to the proud and to those who fall away to a lie. 5 Many things, O Yahweh my God, you have done— your wonderful deeds and your thoughts toward us. There is none to compare with you. If I tried to proclaim and tell of them, they would be too numerous to count. 6 A sacrifice and offering you do not desire. My ears you have opened. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not demanded. 7 Then I said, “Look, I come. In the scroll of the book it is written concerning me: 8 ‘I delight to do your will, O my God, and your law is deep within me.’ ” 9 I have brought good tidings of righteousness in the great congregation. Look, I have not shut my lips. O Yahweh, you surely know that. 10 Your righteousness I have not hidden in the midst of my heart. I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation. I have not concealed your loyal love or your faithfulness from the great congregation. 11 As for you, O Yahweh, do not withhold your mercies from me. Let your loyal love and your faithfulness continually preserve me. 12 For evils without number have encompassed me. My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails me. 13 Be pleased, O Yahweh, to deliver me. O Yahweh, hurry to help me. 14 Let them be shamed and abashed altogether who seek to take away my life. Let them be repulsed and humiliated who desire my harm. 15 Let them be appalled because of their shame, those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” 16 Let them rejoice and be glad in you, all those who seek you. Let them say continually, “Yahweh is great!” —those who love your salvation. 17 But I am poor and needy. Let my Lord consider me. You are my help and my deliverer. O my God, do not delay. For the music director. A psalm of David. 1 Blessed is the one who has regard for the poor; in the day of disaster, Yahweh delivers him. 2 Yahweh protects him and keeps him alive; he is blessed in the land, and you do not give him into the will of his enemies. 3 Yahweh sustains him on his sick bed. In his illness, you restore to health. 4 As for me, I said, “O Yahweh, be gracious to me. Heal me, for I have sinned against you.” 5 My enemies speak evil about me, “When will he die and his name perish?” 6 And when one comes to see me, he speaks falsely; his heart gathers disaster for itself. He goes out to the street; he speaks. 7 All who hate me speak together against me. Against me they assume the worst for me: 8 “A ruinous thing is poured out on him, and now that he lies down, he will not rise up again.” 9 Even my close friend, whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me. 10 But you, O Yahweh, be gracious to me and raise me up that I may repay them. 11 By this I know that you delight in me: because my enemy has not shouted in triumph over me. 12 As for me, you have upheld me in my integrity, and you have set me in your presence forever. 13 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.

Psalms,"1 As a deer longs for streams of water, so my soul longs for you, O God. 2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? 3 My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?” 4 These I remember and I pour out my soul within me: that I would go with the multitude; I led them in procession to the house of God, with a voice of rejoicing and thanksgiving, a crowd celebrating a festival. 5 Why are you in despair, O my soul, and disturbed within me? Hope in God, because I will again praise him, for the salvation of his presence. 6 O my God, within me my soul is in despair; therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan and the heights of Hermon, from the mountain of Mizar. 7 Deep is calling to deep at the thunder of your waterfalls. All your breakers and your waves have passed over me. 8 By day Yahweh commands his loyal love, and in the night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life. 9 I say to God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why must I walk about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?” 10 As with a shattering in my bones my oppressors taunt me, while they say to me all day, “Where is your God?” 11 Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, because I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God. 1 Judge me, O God, and plead my case against an unfaithful nation. From a man of deceit and wickedness rescue me, 2 because you are the God of my refuge. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 3 Send your light and your truth; they shall lead me. They shall bring me to your holy mountain and to your dwelling places. 4 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my surpassing joy, and I will praise you with lyre, O God, my God. 5 Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, because I will again praise him, my salvation and my God. For the music director. Of the sons of Korah. A maskil. 1 O God, we have heard with our ears; our ancestors have told us of work you worked in their days, in days of old. 2 You with your hand drove out the nations, but them you planted. You harmed the peoples, but them you let spread out. 3 For not with their sword did they possess the land, and their arm did not give them victory. Rather it was your right hand and your arm and the light of your presence, because you delighted in them. 4 You are my king, O God. Command victories for Jacob.

Psalms,"4 You are my king, O God. Command victories for Jacob. 5 By you we push down our enemies; by your name we tread down those who rise up against us. 6 For I do not trust my bow, and my sword cannot give me victory. 7 Rather you have saved us from our enemies, and have humiliated those who hate us. 8 In God we boast all the day, and we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah 9 Surely you have rejected and disgraced us, and have not gone out with our armies. 10 You have caused us to pull back from the enemy, and so those who hate us have plundered for themselves. 11 You have given us as sheep for food, and among the nations you have scattered us. 12 You have sold your people cheaply, and did not profit by their price. 13 You have made us a taunt to our neighbors, a derision and a scorn to those around us. 14 You have made us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples. 15 All day long my disgrace is before me, and the shame of my face covers me, 16 because of the voice of the taunter and the reviler, because of the enemy and the avenger. 17 All this has befallen us, though we have not forgotten you, and we have not been false to your covenant. 18 Our heart has not turned back, and our steps have not turned aside from your way. 19 But you have crushed us in a place of jackals, and have covered us with deep shadow. 20 If we had forgotten the name of our God, or had spread out our hands in prayer to a foreign god, 21 would not God discover this, for he knows the secrets of the heart? 22 Rather, on account of you we are killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep for slaughter. 23 Wake up! Why do you sleep, O Lord? Awake! Do not reject forever. 24 Why do you hide your face? Have you forgotten our misery and our oppression? 25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust. Our body clings to the ground. 26 Rise up! Be a help for us, and redeem us for the sake of your loyal love. For the music director; according to The Lilies. Of the sons of Korah. A maskil. A song of love. 1 My heart is moved with a good word; I recite my compositions to the king. My tongue is the pen of a skilled scribe. 2 You are the most handsome of the sons of humankind; grace is poured out on your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever. 3 Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendor and your majesty. 4 And in your majesty ride victoriously, because of truth and humility and righteousness. And let your right hand teach you awesome deeds. 5 Your arrows are sharp; peoples fall under you in the midst of the king’s enemies. 6 Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. A scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom. 7 You love righteousness and hate wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you from among your companions with festive oil. 8 All your robes are scented with myrrh and aloes and cassia. From palaces of ivory stringed instruments gladden you. 9 Kings’ daughters are among your noble ladies. The queen stands at your right hand in gold of Ophir. 10 Hear, O daughter, and discern and incline your ear, and forget your people and your father’s house. 11 Let the king desire your beauty. Because he is your lord, therefore bow down to him. 12 Even the daughter of Tyre will come with a gift. The rich from among people will seek your favor. 13 The king’s daughter is all glorious within; her garment is of gold embroidered cloth. 14 She is brought to the king in colorful garments. The young women behind her, her attendants, are being brought to you. 15 They are led with joy and gladness. They enter the palace of the king. 16 In place of your fathers will be your sons. You will make them princes in all the land. 17 I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore peoples will praise you forever and ever.

Psalms,"For the music director. Of the sons of Korah. According to Alamoth. A song. 1 God is our refuge and strength, a very sufficient help in troubles. 2 Therefore we will not fear though the earth change, and though the mountains totter into the midst of the sea, 3 though its waters roar and foam, though mountains shake with its surging water. Selah 4 There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God, the holiest of the dwellings of the Most High. 5 God is in the midst of her; she will not be made to totter. God will help her at daybreak. 6 Nations roar, kingdoms shake; he utters his voice, the earth melts. 7 Yahweh of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high stronghold. Selah 8 Come, see the works of Yahweh, who has placed desolations on the earth. 9 He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth; he breaks the bow and cuts off the spear. The wagons of war he burns with fire. 10 “Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted in the earth.” 11 Yahweh of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high stronghold. Selah For the music director. Of the sons of Korah. A psalm. 1 All you peoples, clap your hands. Shout to God with a voice of rejoicing. 2 For Yahweh Most High is awesome, a great king over all the earth. 3 He subdues peoples under us and nations under our feet. 4 He chooses for us our inheritance, the pride of Jacob whom he loves. Selah 5 God has gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet. 6 Sing praises to God, sing praises. Sing praises to our king, sing praises. 7 For God is king of all the earth. Sing praises with understanding. 8 God reigns over nations; God sits on his holy throne. 9 The princes of the peoples are gathered together with the people of Abraham’s God. For the shields of the earth belong to God. He is very exalted. A song. A psalm of the sons of Korah. 1 Yahweh is great and very worthy of praise in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. 2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great king. 3 God is in her citadels; he is known as a high stronghold. 4 For see, the kings assembled; they advanced together. 5 They themselves saw it, so they were astonished. They were terrified; they ran off. 6 Trembling seized them there— pain as of a woman in labor. 7 With an east wind you shatter the ships of Tarshish. 8 As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of Yahweh of hosts, in the city of our God. God will establish her forever. Selah 9 We have pondered your loyal love, O God, in the midst of your temple. 10 As is your name, O God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness. 11 Let Mount Zion rejoice; let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments. 12 Walk about Zion and circle it; count her towers. 13 Consider well her ramparts. Go through her citadels so that you can tell the next generation 14 that this is God, our God forever and ever. He himself will guide us until death.

Psalms,"For the music director. Of the sons of Korah. A psalm. 1 Hear this, all you peoples; give ear, all you inhabitants of the world, 2 both low and high, rich and poor together. 3 My mouth will speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart will be understanding. 4 I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will propound my riddle on a lyre. 5 Why should I fear in times of calamity, when iniquity surrounds me at my heels, 6 those who trust their wealth and boast about the abundance of their riches? 7 Surely a man cannot redeem a brother. He cannot give to God his ransom 8 (since the redemption price for their life is costly and it always fails), 9 so that he may stay alive forever and not see the pit. 10 For he sees that the wise die, together with the fool and brute they perish, and leave their wealth to the next generation. 11 Within them they think their houses are forever, their dwelling places from generation to generation. They name their lands by their own names. 12 But man cannot continue in his pomp. He is like the beasts that perish. 13 This is the journey of those who have foolish confidence, and those after them who accept their sayings. Selah 14 Like sheep they are destined to Sheol; death will shepherd them. But the upright will rule over them in the morning, and their forms will be for Sheol to consume, far from his lofty abode. 15 Surely God will ransom my life from the power of Sheol, because he will receive me. Selah 16 Do not fear when a man becomes rich, when the wealth of his house increases, 17 because when he dies he will not take away any of it. His wealth will not follow down after him. 18 Though he congratulated his soul while he was living —and people will praise you when you do well for yourself— 19 it will go to the generation of his fathers. Never will they see light. 20 Humankind in its pomp, but does not understand, is like the beasts that perish. A psalm of Asaph. 1 The Supreme God, God, Yahweh, has spoken and summoned the earth, from the rising of the sun to its setting. 2 From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth. 3 Our God comes and he is not silent. Before him fire devours, and around him it is very tempestuous. 4 He summons the heavens above and the earth that he might judge his people: 5 “Gather to me my loyal ones, those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” 6 And the heavens declare his righteousness, because God himself is judge. Selah 7 “Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you. I am God, your God. 8 It is not concerning a lack of your sacrifices that I rebuke you, and your burnt offerings are before me continually. 9 I will not take from your house a bull or from your stalls a he-goat, 10 because every animal of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. 11 I know every bird of the mountains, and every moving creature in the field is mine. 12 If I were hungry I would not tell you, because the world and its fullness are mine. 13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? 14 Offer to God a thank offering and pay your vows to the Most High. 15 And call me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will glorify me.” 16 But to the wicked God says, “What right have you to recite my statutes and mention my covenant with your mouth, 17 while you yourself hate discipline, and cast my words behind you? 18 When you see a thief, then you are pleased with him, and your association is with adulterers. 19 You give your mouth free rein for evil, and you harness your tongue to deceit. 20 You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your mother’s son. 21 These things you have done, and I have been silent; You imagined that I was just like you. I will rebuke you and present an argument before your eyes. 22 Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there will be none to deliver. 23 He who sacrifices a thank offering honors me, and he who orders his way; I will show him the salvation of God.” ","Psalms 49, 50",http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/psalms-49-50-359398/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-09-05_psalms-49-50_20130808122123.mp3
Psalms,"For the music director. A psalm of David. When Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. 1 Be gracious to me, O God, according to your loyal love. According to your abundant mercies, blot out my transgressions. 2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and from my sin cleanse me. 3 For I myself know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. 4 Against you, only you, I have sinned and have done this evil in your eyes, so that you are correct when you speak, you are blameless when you judge. 5 Behold, in iniquity I was born, and in sin my mother conceived me. 6 Behold, you delight in truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden parts you make me to know wisdom. 7 Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 8 Make me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice. 9 Hide your face from my sins, and all my iniquities blot out. 10 Create a clean heart for me, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. 11 Do not cast me away from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. 12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and with a willing spirit sustain me. 13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn back to you. 14 Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation; then my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness. 15 O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will proclaim your praise. 16 For you do not delight in sacrifice or I would give it. With a burnt offering you are not pleased. 17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; A broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. 18 Do good in your favor toward Zion. Build the walls of Jerusalem. 19 Then you will delight in righteous sacrifices, burnt offering and whole burnt offering. Then bulls will be offered on your altar.

Psalms,"For the music director. A maskil of David. When Doeg the Edomite came and informed Saul. And he said to him, “David has come to the house of Ahimelech.” 1 Why do you boast about evil, O mighty man? The loyal love of God endures continually. 2 Your tongue plans destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceit. 3 You love evil more than good, a lie more than speaking what is right. Selah 4 You love all devouring words, O deceitful tongue, 5 but God will pull you down forever. He will snatch you and tear you away from your tent, and he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah 6 And the righteous will see and fear, and will laugh at him, saying, 7 “Look, the man who would not make God his refuge, but he trusted in the greatness of his wealth; he took refuge in his destructiveness.” 8 But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God. I trust the loyal love of God forever and ever. 9 I will give thanks to you forever, because of what you have done, and I will wait on your name, because it is good, in the presence of your faithful ones. For the music director, according to Mahalath. A maskil of David. 1 The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt and they have done abominable iniquity. There is none who does good. 2 God looks down from heaven upon the children of humankind to see whether there is one who has insight, one who seeks God. 3 All of them have turned back. They are altogether corrupt. There is none who does good; there is not even one. 4 Do not evildoers know, they who eat my people as though they were eating bread? They do not call on God. 5 There they are very fearful where no fear had been, because God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you. You have put them to shame, because God has rejected them. 6 Oh, that from Zion would come salvation for Israel! When God returns the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. For the music director, with stringed instruments. A maskil of David, when the Ziphites went and said to Saul, “Is not David hiding himself among us?” 1 O God, by your name save me, and by your power vindicate me. 2 O God, hear my prayer; heed the words of my mouth. 3 For foreigners have risen against me, and ruthless men seek my life. They have not set God before them. Selah 4 See, God is my helper; The Lord is with those who sustain my life. 5 He will repay my enemies for their evil; in your faithfulness destroy them. 6 I will freely sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O Yahweh, because it is good. 7 Because he has delivered me from all trouble, and my eye has looked with satisfaction on my enemies. For the music director, with stringed instruments. A maskil of David. 1 Give ear, O God, to my prayer, and do not hide yourself from my plea. 2 Attend to me and answer me. I am restless in my lamenting and I groan, 3 because of the voice of an enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked, because they bring down evil on me, and in anger they hold a grudge against me. 4 My heart trembles within me, and deathly terrors fall on me. 5 Fear and trembling come on me, and horror overwhelms me. 6 So I say, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove. I would fly away and be at rest. 7 Look, I would flee far away. I would dwell in the wilderness. Selah 8 I would hurry to my refuge from the raging wind and storm.” 9 Confuse, O Lord; divide their speech, because I see violence and strife in the city. 10 Day and night they go around it on its walls, and iniquity and trouble are in its midst. 11 Destruction is within it, and oppression and deceit do not depart from its public square. 12 For it is not an enemy that taunts me, or I could bear it. It is not one who hates me that magnifies himself over me, or I could hide myself from him. 13 But it is you, a man my equal, my friend and confidant. 14 We who would take sweet counsel together; in the house of God we would walk with the throng. 15 Let death deceive them. May they descend to Sheol alive, because evil is in their home and heart. 16 As for me, I will call to God, and Yahweh will save me. 17 Morning, noon and night I will lament and groan loudly, and he will hear my voice. 18 He safely redeems my life from the battle against me, because those standing against me are among many. 19 God will hear and answer them, he who is enthroned from of old, Selah Because they do not change, and they do not fear God. 20 He has put forth his hands against his friends; he has defiled his covenant. 21 The buttery words of his mouth were smooth, but there was battle in his heart. His words were smoother than oil, but they were drawn swords. 22 Cast your burden on Yahweh, and he will sustain you. He will never allow the righteous to be moved. 23 But you, O God, you will bring them down to the pit of corruption. The men of bloodshed and deceit will not live half their days, but I will trust you.

Psalms,"For the music director, according to The Silent Dove of Distant Lands. Of David. A miktam. When the Philistines seized him in Gath. 1 Be gracious to me, O God, because humankind has trampled me; fighting all the day he oppresses me. 2 My enemies trample all day, because many are attacking me proudly. 3 When I fear, I trust you. 4 God, whose word I praise, God I trust; I do not fear. What can mere flesh do to me? 5 All day they twist my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil. 6 They attack, they hide, they watch my steps, as they lie in wait for my life. 7 Because of iniquity will they escape? In anger cast down the peoples, O God. 8 You have kept count of my wonderings. Put my tears in your bottle; are they not in your book? 9 Then my enemies will turn back when I call. This I know because God is for me. 10 God, whose word I praise, Yahweh, whose word I praise, 11 God I trust; I do not fear. What can mere humankind do to me? 12 My vows to you, O God, are binding upon me. I will pay thank offerings to you, 13 because you have delivered my soul from death. Have you not kept my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living? For the music director, according to Do Not Destroy. Of David. A miktam. When he fled from Saul into the cave. 1 Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me, because in you my soul takes refuge. In the shadow of your wings I will take refuge until destruction passes by. 2 I will call to God Most High, to God who accomplishes things concerning me. 3 He will send from heaven and save me; he will reproach the one who tramples me. Selah God will send his loyal love and his faithfulness. 4 My soul is among lions. I lie down among those who devour— the children of humankind whose teeth are spears and arrows and whose tongues are sharp swords. 5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God. Let your glory be above all the earth. 6 They have set a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down. They have dug a pit before me; they have fallen into the midst of it. Selah 7 My heart is steadfast, O God; My heart is steadfast. I will sing and give praise. 8 Awake, my glory; Awake, harp and lyre. I will awake the dawn. 9 I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Lord; I will give you praise among the nations. 10 Because your loyal love is high to the heavens, and your faithfulness to the clouds. 11 Be exalted above the heavens, O God. Let your glory be above all the earth. For the music director, according to Do not Destroy. Of David. A miktam. 1 Do you really speak what is right when silent? Do you judge fairly the children of humankind? 2 No, in your heart you plan injustices; in the land you weigh out the violence of your hands. 3 The wicked are estranged from the womb. They go astray from the belly, speaking lies. 4 Their venom is like snake venom; They are like a deaf viper that closes its ear 5 so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or the skilled caster of spells. 6 O God, break their teeth in their mouth. Break off the fangs of the young lions, O Yahweh. 7 Let them run away like water that runs off. When he bends the bow, let his arrows be as though they were cut off. 8 Let them be like a snail that melts away as it goes; like the stillborn of woman that do not see the sun. 9 Before your pots can feel the heat of a thornbush, whether green or dry, he will sweep it away. 10 The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 11 And people will say, “Surely there is a reward for the righteous. Surely there is a God who judges in the land.” For the music director, according to Do Not Destroy. Of David. A miktam. When Saul dispatched men and they watched the house to kill him. 1 Deliver me from my enemies, O my God. Protect me from those who rise up against me. 2 Deliver me from workers of iniquity, and from men of bloodshed save me. 3 For look, they lie in wait for my life. The mighty attack against me, not because of my transgression or my sin, O Yahweh. 4 Without guilt on my part they run and ready themselves. Awake to meet me and see. 5 And you, Yahweh, God of hosts, are the God of Israel. Rouse yourself to punish all the nations. Do not be gracious to any who treacherously plot evil. Selah 6 They return at evening; they howl like dogs while they prowl the city. 7 Look, they pour out talk with their mouth. Swords are on their lips, for they say, “Who hears?” 8 But you, O Yahweh, will laugh at them; you will mock all the nations. 9 O my strength, I will watch for you, because you, O God, are my high stronghold. 10 My God of loyal love will meet me; God will cause me to look in triumph on my enemies. 11 Do not kill them, lest my people forget. Make them to wander by your power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield. 12 By the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips, even in their pride, let them be trapped, and for the curses and lies they proclaim. 13 Destroy in anger; destroy so they are no more, so that they may know that God is ruling in Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah 14 They return at evening; they howl like dogs while they prowl the city. 15 As for them, they wander for food. If they are not satisfied, then they continue all night. 16 But as for me, I will sing of your strength, and I will hail your loyal love in the morning, because you have been my high stronghold and a refuge in my time of trouble. 17 O my strength, to you I will give praise, because God is my high stronghold, my God of loyal love. For the music director, according to Shushan Eduth. A miktam of David. To teach. When he fought Mesopotamia and Aram Zobah, and Joab returned and struck Edom in the Valley of Salt, twelve thousand persons. 1 O God, you have rejected us. You have broken us. You have been angry. Restore us! 2 You have made the land quake. You have split it open. Heal its fissures, because it totters. 3 You have shown your people hard things; You have given us wine that staggers. 4 You have rallied those who fear you round a banner out of bowshot, Selah 5 so that your beloved ones may be rescued. Save by your right hand and answer us. 6 God has spoken in his holiness, “I will rejoice; I will divide up Shechem, and portion out the valley of Succoth. 7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the helmet for my head; Judah is my scepter. 8 Moab is my washing pot; over Edom, I will cast my sandal. On account of me, O Philistia, raise a shout.” 9 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 10 Have not you yourself rejected us, O God, and not gone out with our armies, O God? 11 Give us help against the adversary, for the help of humankind is futile. 12 Through God we will do valiantly, and it is he who will tread down our enemies.

Psalms,"For the music director, upon stringed instruments. Of David. 1 Hear, O God, my cry; attend to my prayer. 2 From the end of the earth I call to you when my heart grows faint. You will lead me to a rock that is higher than I. 3 For you have been my refuge, a strong tower from the enemy. 4 Let me reside in your tent forever. Let me take refuge under the covering of your wings. Selah 5 For you, O God, you have heard my vows. You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name. 6 You will add days to the days of the king, his years like those of many generations. 7 May he live forever in the presence of God. Appoint loyal love and faithfulness to preserve him. 8 So I will sing the praise of your name forever, that I may fulfill my vows daily. For the music director, on Jeduthun. A psalm of David. 1 Only for God my soul waits in silence. From him is my salvation. 2 Only he is my rock and my salvation, my high stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken. 3 How long will you attack a man? All of you will be shattered like a leaning wall, a tottering fence. 4 They only plan to thrust him down from his high position; they are pleased with deception. With their mouths they bless, but inwardly they curse. Selah 5 Only for God wait in silence, O my soul, because my hope is from him. 6 Only he is my rock and my salvation, my high stronghold; I shall not be shaken. 7 On God rests my salvation and my glory; God is my strong rock, my refuge. 8 Trust him at all times, O people; pour out before him your heart. God is a refuge for us. Selah 9 Only a vapor are men of low degree, a deception are men of high degree. Weighed in a balance, together they are lighter than a vapor. 10 Do not trust in extortion, and do not put vain confidence in robbery. If wealth increases, do not set your heart on it. 11 Once God has spoken; twice I have heard this: that strength belongs to God. 12 And to you belongs loyal love, O Lord, because you will render to each according to his work. A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. 1 O God, you are my God; I will seek you diligently. My soul thirsts for you; my flesh longs for you as in a dry and weary land without water. 2 Thus I have seen you in the sanctuary, beholding your strength and glory. 3 Because your loyal love is better than life, my lips will praise you. 4 So I will bless you while I live. I will lift up my hands in your name. 5 My soul will be satisfied as with the best and richest food, and with joyful lips my mouth will praise. 6 When I remember you on my bed, I meditate on you in the night watches. 7 Because you have been my help, therefore in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy. 8 My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me. 9 But as for them who seek my life for ruin, they will go into the depths of the earth. 10 They who would deliver him to the sword will become a portion for jackals. 11 However, the king will rejoice in God. Everyone who swears an oath by him will boast, because the mouth of the liars will be stopped. For the music director. A psalm of David. 1 Hear my voice, O God, in my lamenting. Preserve my life from the fear of the enemy. 2 Hide me from the secret plots of evildoers, from the unrest of those who do iniquity, 3 who sharpen their tongue like a sword. They bend their bow to shoot their arrows—bitter words, 4 to shoot from their hiding places at the blameless. Suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear. 5 They encourage themselves in the evil matter. They talk of secretly laying snares. They say, “Who will see them?” 6 They carefully plot injustices saying, “We have perfected the perfect plot!” Both the inner thought and heart of a man are deep. 7 But God will shoot them; with an arrow they will suddenly be wounded. 8 And they who would cause him to stumble, their own tongue will be against them. All who gaze on them will shake. 9 And then all men will fear, and will declare the working of God, and will understand his doing. 10 The righteous will rejoice in Yahweh and take refuge in him, and all the upright in heart will boast. For the music director. A psalm of David. A song. 1 Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion, and to you the vow shall be fulfilled. 2 O you who hear prayer, to you all flesh will come. 3 Iniquities prevail over me. As for our transgressions, you will forgive them. 4 Blessed is one whom you choose and bring near, that he may abide in your courts. We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house, your holy temple. 5 By awesome deeds in righteousness you will answer us, O God of our salvation, you who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth and of the far-off seas, 6 who established the mountains by his strength, the one who is girded with might, 7 who stills the roar of the seas, the roar of their waves, and the commotion of the peoples, 8 so that the inhabitants of the farthest reaches are in awe of your signs. You make the dawn and sunset sing for joy. 9 You care for the land and water it; you greatly enrich it. The stream of God is filled with waters. You provide their grain, for so you have established it. 10 You drench its furrows, penetrating its ridges. With rains you soften it; its growth you bless. 11 You crown the year with your bounty, and your wagon paths drip with richness. 12 They drop on the pastures of the wilderness, and the hills gird themselves with joy. 13 The pasturelands put on flocks, and the valleys clothe themselves with grain. They shout in triumph; they even sing. For the music director. A song. A psalm. 1 Shout joyfully to God, all the earth. 2 Sing the glory of his name. Set forth his glorious praise. 3 Say to God, “How awesome are your works! Because of the greatness of your strength, your enemies will cringe before you. 4 All the earth will bow in worship to you, and sing praise to you. They will sing the praise of your name.” Selah 5 Come and consider the works of God; he is awesome in his dealings with the children of humankind. 6 He turned the sea into dry ground; they passed through the river on foot. There we rejoiced in him. 7 He rules by his might forever; his eyes keep watch on the nations. Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah 8 Bless our God, O peoples, and cause the sound of his praise to be heard, 9 the one who has kept our soul among the living, and has not allowed our foot to slip. 10 For you have tested us, O God; you have tried us as silver is tried. 11 You brought us into the net; you placed a heavy burden on our backs. 12 You let men ride over our heads. We went through fire and through water, but you have brought us out to the place of abundance. 13 I will come into your house with burnt offerings. I will pay to you my vows 14 that my lips uttered, and my mouth spoke in my distress. 15 Burnt offerings of fat animals I will offer to you, with the smoke of rams. I will do cattle with rams. Selah 16 Come and hear, all you God-fearers, and I will tell what he has done for me. 17 I called to him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue. 18 If I had considered evil in my heart, the Lord would not have listened. 19 However, God has listened; he has attended to the sound of my prayer. 20 Blessed be God, who has not turned aside my prayer, or his loyal love from me.

Psalms,"For the music director, with stringed instruments. A psalm. A song. 1 May God be gracious to us and bless us. May he cause his face to shine toward us, Selah 2 that your way may be known on the earth, your salvation among all nations. 3 Let the peoples praise you, O God; let all of the peoples praise you. 4 Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, because you judge the peoples with equity and guide the nations on the earth. Selah 5 Let the peoples praise you, O God; let all the peoples praise you. 6 The earth has yielded its produce. God, our God, will bless us. 7 God will bless us, and all the ends of the earth will fear him. For the music director. Of David. A psalm. A song. 1 God will arise; his enemies will be scattered, and those who hate him will flee from before him. 2 As smoke is driven off, you will drive them off. As wax melts before fire, the wicked will perish before God. 3 But the righteous will be glad; they will exalt before God, and will rejoice with joy. 4 Sing to God, sing praises to his name. Lift up a song to the rider on the clouds—his name is Yah— and rejoice before him. 5 A father to orphans and a judge for widows is God in his holy habitation. 6 God settles the lonely in a home; he brings prisoners out into prosperity. But the rebellious abide in a barren land. 7 O God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the desert, Selah 8 the earth shook; the heavens also dripped rain at the presence of God who was at Sinai, at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 9 You caused abundant rain to fall, O God. When your inheritance was weary you revived it. 10 Your community dwelled in it. You provided in your goodness for the poor, O God. 11 The Lord gives the word. Great is the company of women who announce: 12 “The kings of armies flee, they flee, and she who remains at home divides the spoil. 13 Though you men lie down between the sheepfolds, you will be like the wings of a dove covered in silver and its pinions in yellow gold.” 14 When Shaddai scattered kings on it, on Zalmon it snowed. 15 A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of many peaks is the mountain of Bashan. 16 Why do you look with hostility, O many-peaked mountains? This mountain God desires for his dwelling. Yes, Yahweh will abide in it forever. 17 The chariots of God are twice ten thousand, with thousands doubled. The Lord is among them at Sinai, distinctive in victory. 18 You have ascended on high; you have led away captives. You have received gifts from among humankind, and even from the rebellious, so that Yah God may dwell there. 19 Blessed be the Lord. Daily he loads us with benefits, the God of our salvation. Selah 20 Our God is a God of deliverances, and to the Yahweh the Lord belong escapes from death. 21 But God will shatter the head of his enemies, the hairy scalp of the one who continues on in his guilt. 22 The Lord said, “I will bring them back from Bashan; I will bring them back from the depths of the sea, 23 so that your foot may shatter them bloody for the tongues of your dogs to have their share from the enemies.” 24 They have seen your processions, O God, the processions of my God, my king, distinctive in victory. 25 Singers went up front, those playing stringed instruments last, between them young women playing tambourines. 26 Bless God in the assemblies, Yahweh from the fountain of Israel. 27 There is little Benjamin ruling them, with the princes of Judah in their throng, the princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali. 28 Your God has commanded your strength. Show yourself strong, O God, by what you perform for us. 29 Because your temple is above Jerusalem, kings will bring tribute to you. 30 Rebuke the beasts in the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples, trampling the pieces of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in battles. 31 Ambassadors will come from Egypt; Cush will quickly stretch out her hands to God. 32 O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God; sing praise to the Lord, Selah 33 to the one who rides in the highest heavens of old. See, he gives forth his voice, a mighty voice. 34 Ascribe strength to God. His majesty is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds. 35 Awesome are you, O God, from your sanctuary. The God of Israel, it is he who gives strength and might to the people. Blessed be God.

Psalms,"For the music director, according to The Lilies. Of David. 1 Save me, O God, because waters have come up to my neck. 2 I sink in the mud of the deep, and there is no foothold. I have come to watery depths, and the torrent floods over me. 3 I am weary with my calling out; my throat is parched. My eyes are exhausted in my waiting for my God. 4 More numerous than the hairs of my head are those hating me without a cause. Those who are destroying me—my enemies wrongfully— are mighty. What I did not steal, I then must restore. 5 O God, you yourself know my foolishness, and my guilty deeds are not hidden from you. 6 Let those who wait for you not be put to shame because of me, O Lord Yahweh of hosts. Let those who seek you not be disgraced because of me, O God of Israel. 7 Because on account of you I have borne reproach; disgrace has covered my face. 8 I have become a stranger to my brothers and a foreigner to my mother’s sons, 9 because the zeal for your house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen on me. 10 When I wept in the fasting of my soul, it became reproaches for me. 11 When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became for them a byword. 12 Those sitting at the gate talk about me as also the songs of the drunkards. 13 But as for me, my prayer is to you, O Yahweh, for a favorable time, O God, according to the abundance of your loyal love. Answer me with the faithfulness of your salvation. 14 Deliver me from the mud and do not let me sink. Let me be delivered from those who hate me and from the watery depths. 15 Do not let the torrent of waters flood over me, or the deep swallow me, or the pit close its mouth over me. 16 Answer me, O Yahweh, because your loyal love is good; according to your abundant mercies, turn to me, 17 and do not hide your face from your servant. Because I am in trouble, answer me quickly. 18 Draw near to my soul; redeem it. Because of my enemies, ransom me. 19 You know my reproach, my shame and my disgrace. Fully known to you are all my adversaries. 20 Reproach has broken my heart and I am sick. And I hoped for sympathy, but there was none, and for comforters, but I found none. 21 They also gave me gall for food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 22 Let their table before them be a trap, and their times of peace a snare. 23 Let their eyes be dark so they cannot see, and make their loins continually tremble. 24 Pour out your indignation on them, and let your burning anger overtake them. 25 Let their camp be desolate. Let none dwell in their tents, 26 because they persecute those whom you, yourself, have struck, and they tell of the pain of those you have wounded. 27 Add guilt on top of their guilt, and do not let them be acquitted. 28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and let them not be recorded with the righteous. 29 But as for me, though I am afflicted and pained, your salvation will protect me, O God. 30 I will praise the name of God in song, and magnify him with thanksgiving. 31 For Yahweh it will be better than an ox or bull, horned and hoofed. 32 The afflicted will see and rejoice. O God seekers, let your heart revive, 33 because Yahweh hears the needy and does not despise his own who are prisoners. 34 Let heavens and earth praise him, the seas and all that moves in them, 35 because God will save Zion and build the cities of Judah, that they may dwell there and possess it. 36 And the offspring of his servants will inherit it, and those who love his name will abide in it. For the music director. Of David. To bring to remembrance. 1 O God, make haste to deliver me. O Yahweh, make haste to help me. 2 Let them be ashamed and abashed who seek my life. Let them be repulsed and humiliated who desire my harm. 3 let them turn back because of their shame, those who say, “Aha! Aha!” 4 Let them rejoice and be glad in you, all those who seek you. Let them say continually, “God is great!” those who love your salvation. 5 But I am poor and needy; O God hasten to me. You are my help and my deliverer. O Yahweh, do not delay. 1 In you, O Yahweh, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame. 2 In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me; incline your ear to me and save me. 3 Be for me a rock of refuge to resort to always; you have ordained to save me, because you are my rock and my fortress. 4 My God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the evildoer and the oppressor, 5 because you are my hope, O Lord Yahweh, my confidence from my youth. 6 Upon you I have leaned from birth. It was you who took me from the womb of my mother. My praise is of you continually. 7 I have become a wonder to many, but you are my strong refuge. 8 My mouth is filled with your praise, with your glory all the day. 9 Do not cast me away in the time of old age; when my strength fails do not abandon me. 10 For my enemies talk concerning me, and those who watch for my life conspire together, 11 saying, “His God has abandoned him. Pursue and seize him, because there is no deliverer.” 12 O God, do not be far from me. My God, hurry to help me. 13 Let them be ashamed; let them perish who are my adversaries. Let them wrap themselves with scorn and disgrace who seek my harm. 14 But as for me, I will hope continually and increase your praise. 15 My mouth will tell of your righteousness, your salvation all day long, though I do not know the full sum of them. 16 I will come in to tell the mighty deeds of Lord Yahweh. I will make known your righteousness, yours only. 17 O God, you have taught me from my youth, and up to now I have proclaimed your wonderful deeds. 18 And even when I am old and gray, O God, do not abandon me until I proclaim your strength to this generation, your power to every one that comes after. 19 And your righteousness, O God, is to the height of heaven. You who have done great things, O God, who is like you? 20 You who have caused me to see many troubles and evils, you will again revive me. And from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up. 21 You will increase my greatness, and you will comfort me all around. 22 On my part, I will praise you with a stringed instrument, and your faithfulness, O my God. I will sing praises to you with a lyre, O Holy One of Israel. 23 My lips will sing for joy when I sing praises to you, and my soul, which you have redeemed. 24 My tongue also will speak of your righteousness all the day, because they have been put to shame, because they have been humiliated who seek my harm. Of Solomon. 1 O God, give your judgments to the king, and your righteousness to the king’s son. 2 May he judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice. 3 Let the mountains yield prosperity for the people, and the hills in righteousness. 4 May he provide justice for the poor of the people, save the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor. 5 May he live long while the sun endures as long as the moon for all generations. 6 May he descend like rain on mown grass, like showers watering the earth. 7 May what is right blossom in his days and an abundance of peace, until the moon is no more. 8 And may he rule from sea up to sea, and from the River to the edges of the land. 9 Let the desert dwellers bow down before him, and his enemies lick the dust. 10 Let the kings of Tarshish and the islands bring tribute. Let the kings of Sheba and Seba present gifts, 11 and let all kings bow down to him. Let all nations serve him. 12 Indeed he will deliver the needy who is crying for help, and the afflicted who has no helper. 13 He will take pity on the helpless and needy, and the lives of the needy he will save. 14 From oppression and from violence he will redeem their lives, and their blood will be precious in his eyes. 15 So may he live, and may gold from Sheba be given to him, and may prayers be offered for him continually. May blessings be invoked for him all day long. 16 May there be an abundance of grain in the land even on the top of the mountains. May his crop sway like the trees of Lebanon, and may those from the city blossom like the grass of the earth. 17 May his name endure forever. May his name increase as long as the sun shines, and let them be blessed in him. Let all nations call him blessed. 18 Blessed be Yahweh God, the God of Israel, who alone does wonderful things. 19 And blessed be his glorious name forever, and may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen. 20 The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are completed.

Psalms,"A song of Asaph. 1 Surely God is good to Israel, to those pure of heart. 2 But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled. My steps had nearly slipped, 3 because I envied the boastful when I saw the well-being of the wicked. 4 For there are no pains up to their death, and their bodies are healthy. 5 They do not have ordinary trouble, and they are not plagued as other people. 6 Therefore pride is their necklace; an outfit of violence covers them. 7 Their eye bulges from fat. Imaginings overflow their heart. 8 They mock and speak maliciously of oppression; they speak as though from on high. 9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue roams the earth. 10 Therefore his people turn there, and abundant waters are slurped up by them. 11 And they say, “How does God know?” and, “Does the Most High have knowledge?” 12 See, these are the wicked, and they increase wealth, ever carefree. 13 Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure, and washed my hands in innocence. 14 And I have been plagued all day and rebuked every morning. 15 If I had said, “I will speak thus,” behold, I would have acted treacherously against your children’s generation. 16 When I thought about how to understand this, it was troubling in my eyes 17 until I went into the sanctuary of God. Then I understood their fate. 18 Surely you set them on slippery places. You cause them to fall onto ruin. 19 How they become a desolation in a moment! They come to a complete end by terrors. 20 Like a dream upon awakening, when you wake up, O Lord, you will despise their fleeting form. 21 When my heart was embittered and I felt stabbed in my kidneys, 22 then I was brutish and ignorant. With you I was like the beasts. 23 But I am continually with you; you have hold of my right hand. 24 You will guide me with your advice, and afterward you will take me into honor. 25 Whom do I have in the heavens except you? And with you I have no other desire on earth. 26 My flesh and heart failed, but God is the strength of my heart and my reward forever. 27 For indeed, those distancing themselves from you will be ruined. You destroy each who abandons you for harlotry. 28 But as for me, the approach to God is for my good. I have set the Lord Yahweh as my refuge, in order to tell all your works. A maskil of Asaph. 1 Why, O God, have you rejected us forever? Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture? 2 Remember your congregation that you bought long ago, when you redeemed the tribe of your inheritance. Remember Mount Zion where you have dwelt. 3 Lift your steps to the perpetual ruins, to all that the enemy has ruined in the sanctuary. 4 Your enemies have roared in the midst of your meeting place; they have set up their signs for signs. 5 They are known to be like those who wield axes in a thicket of trees. 6 And now its carved works altogether they have smashed with axe and hammer. 7 They have set fire to your sanctuary. They have defiled to the ground, the dwelling place for your name. 8 They have said in their heart, “We will completely oppress them.” They burned all the meeting places of God in the land. 9 We do not see our signs, and there is no longer a prophet. No one with us knows how long. 10 How long, O God, will the adversary taunt? Will the enemy treat your name with contempt forever? 11 Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? Take it from your bosom; destroy them! 12 But God has been my king from long ago, working salvation in the midst of the earth. 13 You split open the sea by your strength; You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters. 14 You crushed the heads of Leviathan; you gave him as food to the desert dwelling creatures. 15 You split open spring and wadi. You dried up ever-flowing rivers. 16 Yours is the day, yours is the night also. You established light and the sun. 17 You defined all the boundaries of the earth; Summer and winter—you formed them. 18 O Yahweh, remember this: the enemy taunts, and foolish people treat your name with contempt. 19 Do not give to beasts the life of your dove; do not ever forget the life of your afflicted ones. 20 Have regard for the covenant, because the dark places of the land are full of the haunts of violence. 21 Do not let the oppressed turn back humiliated; let the poor and needy praise your name. 22 Rise up, O God, plead your cause; remember the reproaching of you by the foolish all day long. 23 Do not forget the sound of your adversaries, the roar of those rising up against you ascending continually. For the music director, according to Do Not Destroy. A psalm of Asaph. A song. 1 We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, and your name is near. Your wonderful deeds are told. 2 “I will indeed set an appointed time; I will judge fairly. 3 The earth and all its inhabitants are shaking; I steady its columns. Selah 4 I say to the boastful, ‘Do not boast!’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn! 5 Do not lift up high your horn. Do not speak with arrogant pride.’ ” 6 For it is not from the east or the west and not from the south that lifting up comes, 7 rather God is the judge; one he brings low, and another he lifts up. 8 For there is a cup in the hand of Yahweh with wine that foams, fully mixed, and he pours out from this. Surely all the wicked of the land will quaff it down to its dregs. 9 But as for me, I will proclaim forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob. 10 “And all the horns of the wicked I will cut off. The horns of the righteous will be lifted up.” ",Psalms 73-75,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/psalms-7375-363169/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-09-16_psalms-7375_20130829173258.mp3
Psalms,"For the music director, with stringed instruments. A psalm of Asaph. A song. 1 God is known in Judah. His name is great in Israel. 2 His den has been in Salem, his lair in Zion. 3 There he broke the flames of the bow, the shield and sword and battle. Selah 4 Radiant you are, majestic, from the mountains of prey. 5 The stouthearted are plundered; they sleep their sleep, and all the able men cannot use their hands. 6 At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse slumber. 7 You, indeed, are to be feared, and who can stand before you when you are angry? 8 From heaven you proclaimed judgment. The earth feared and was still 9 when God rose for justice, to save all the afflicted of the land. Selah 10 For the anger of humankind will praise you. You will put on the remnant of anger. 11 Make vows and fulfill them to Yahweh, your God; let all surrounding him bring tribute to the one to be feared. 12 He cuts off the spirit of leaders. He is to be feared by the kings of the earth. For the music director, on Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A psalm. 1 I cry out with my voice to God; with my voice to God, that he may hear me. 2 In the day I have trouble, I seek the Lord. At night my hand stretches out continually; my soul refuses to be comforted. 3 I remember God and I groan loudly; I meditate and my spirit grows faint. Selah 4 You hold open my eyelids. I am troubled and cannot speak. 5 I think about the days from long ago, the years of ancient times. 6 I remember my song in the night. With my heart I meditate, and my spirit searches to understand. 7 Will the Lord reject us forever, and will he never be pleased with us again? 8 Has his loyal love ceased forever? Is his promise ended throughout generations? 9 Has God forgotten to have compassion? Or has he closed off his mercies in anger? Selah 10 So I said, “This pierces me— the right hand of the Most High has changed.” 11 I will remember the deeds of Yah. Surely I will remember your wonders from long ago. 12 I will also muse on all your work, and meditate on your deeds. 13 O God, your way is distinctive. Who is a great god like our God? 14 You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the peoples. 15 With your arm you redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah 16 Waters saw you, O God; waters saw you and they trembled. Surely the deeps shook. 17 The clouds poured out water. The skies thundered. Your arrows also flew about. 18 The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind; lightnings lit the world; the earth shook and quaked. 19 Your way was through the sea, and your path through many waters. Yet your footprints were not discerned. 20 You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. A maskil of Asaph. 1 Listen, O my people, to my teaching. Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 2 I will offer a parable with my mouth. I will pour out riddles from long ago, 3 that we have heard and known, and our ancestors have told us. 4 We will not hide them from their children, telling the next generation the praises of Yahweh, and his power and his wonders that he has done. 5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach to their children, 6 so that the next generation might know— children yet to be born— that they might rise up and tell their children, 7 that they might set their confidence in God, and not forget the deeds of God, but keep his commandments, 8 and not be like their ancestors, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not make ready its heart, whose spirit was not faithful to God. 9 The sons of Ephraim, armed with archers, turned back on the day of battle. 10 They did not keep the covenant of God and refused to go in his law. 11 They also forgot his deeds, and his wonders that he had shown them. 12 In front of their ancestors he did a wonder, in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan. 13 He split the sea and caused them to go over, and he caused waters to stand like a heap. 14 And he led them with the cloud by day, and all night with a fiery light. 15 He caused rocks to split in the wilderness and provided drink abundantly as from the depths. 16 And he brought streams out of the rock and caused water to flow down like rivers. 17 But they sinned still further against him by rebelling against the Most High in the desert. 18 And they tested God in their heart by asking food for their craving. 19 And they spoke against God. They said, “Is God able to prepare a table in the wilderness? 20 Yes, he struck the rock and water flowed and streams gushed out, but can he also give food or provide meat for his people?” 21 Therefore Yahweh heard and he was very angry, and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and his anger also rose up against Israel, 22 because they did not believe God, and they did not trust his salvation. 23 Nevertheless, he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven, 24 and rained down on them manna to eat and gave them the grain of heaven. 25 Humankind ate the bread of angels. He sent them food enough to be satisfied. 26 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens and drove along the south wind by his strength. 27 Then he rained meat on them like dust, even winged birds like the sand of the seas. 28 He caused them to fall in the midst of his camp, all around his dwellings. 29 So they ate and were well filled, and he brought about what they craved. 30 They had not yet turned aside from their craving, while their food was still in their mouth, 31 the anger of God rose against them, and he killed some of the stoutest of them, even the young men of Israel he caused to bow down in death. 32 In spite of all this they sinned further and did not believe his wonders. 33 And he consumed their days with futility their years with terror. 34 When he killed some of them, then they sought him, and repented and earnestly sought God. 35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and God Most High their redeemer. 36 But they enticed him with their mouth and lied to him with their tongue. 37 For their heart was not steadfast with him, nor were they faithful to his covenant. 38 But he was compassionate; he pardoned their guilt and did not destroy them. And many times he turned back his anger and did not stir up all his wrath, 39 for he remembered that they were flesh, a passing wind that does not return. 40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and vexed him in the wasteland! 41 So they again tested God and distressed the Holy One of Israel. 42 And they did not remember his power when he redeemed them from the enemy, 43 how he performed his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the region of Zoan, 44 when he turned their rivers to blood so they could not drink from their streams. 45 He sent among them flies that devoured them and frogs that destroyed them. 46 And he gave their crop to the locusts and their labor to the locust. 47 He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore trees with sleet. 48 He also handed their cattle over to the hail and their livestock to the lightning bolts. 49 He sent against them his fierce anger, rage and indignation and trouble, a band of destroying angels. 50 He cleared a path for his anger. He did not spare them from death but handed their life over to the plague. 51 And he struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the first of their virility in the tents of Ham. 52 Then he led out his people like sheep and guided them like a herd in the wilderness. 53 And he led them safely and they were not afraid, but the sea covered their enemies. 54 So he brought them to his holy territory, this mountain his right hand acquired. 55 And he drove out nations before them and allocated them for an inheritance by boundary line, and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. 56 But they tested and rebelled against God Most High and did not keep his statutes. 57 And they turned and were treacherous like their ancestors. They twisted like a crooked bow. 58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and made him jealous with their images. 59 God heard and he was very angry and rejected Israel utterly. 60 So he abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, the tent he had placed among humankind. 61 And he gave his strength into captivity and his splendor into the hand of the enemy. 62 He also handed his people over to the sword, and he was very angry with his inheritance. 63 Fire devoured his young men, and his young women were not praised. 64 His priests fell by the sword, and his widows did not weep. 65 Then the Lord awoke like one who had been asleep, awoke like a warrior who had been drunk with wine. 66 And he beat back his enemies; he gave them over to perpetual scorn. 67 And he rejected the tent of Joseph, and did not chose the tribe of Ephraim, 68 but chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion that he loved. 69 And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever. 70 And he chose David his servant and took him from the sheepfolds. 71 He brought him from following nursing ewes to shepherd Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance. 72 And he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, and led them by the skillfulness of his hands.

Psalms,"A psalm of Asaph. 1 O God, the nations have entered your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have reduced Jerusalem to ruins. 2 They have given the bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the heavens, the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth. 3 They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them. 4 We have become a taunt to our neighbors, a derision and a scorn to those around us. 5 How long, O Yahweh? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire? 6 Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call on your name, 7 because they have devoured Jacob and have laid waste his habitation. 8 Do not remember against us former iniquities; let your mercies meet us quickly because we are brought very low. 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; and deliver us and forgive our sins for the sake of your name. 10 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let it be known among the nations before our eyes, by the avenging of the blood of your servants that was poured out. 11 Let the groaning of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your power, spare the children appointed to death. 12 And return to our neighbors sevenfold upon them their taunts with which they taunted you, O Lord. 13 Then we, your people and the flock of your pasture, we will give thanks to you forever. Generation after generation we will tell of your praise. For the music director, according to The Lilies. A testimony. Of Asaph. A psalm. 1 Give ear, O shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock. Shine forth, you who sits enthroned above the cherubim. 2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up your power and come for our salvation. 3 O God, restore us, and cause your face to shine that we may be saved. 4 O Yahweh God of hosts, how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people? 5 You have fed them the bread of tears; you have given them tears to drink in full measure. 6 You have made us an object of strife to our neighbors, and our enemies mock among themselves. 7 O God of hosts, restore us and cause your face to shine that we may be saved. 8 You uprooted a vine from Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it. 9 You prepared a place before it, and it took deep root and filled the land. 10 The mountains were covered with its shade, and the mighty cedars with its boughs. 11 It spread its branches to the sea and its shoots to the river. 12 Why have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass on the road pluck fruit from it? 13 Swine from the forests devour it and creatures of the field feed on it. 14 Please return, O God of hosts. Observe from heaven and see, and pay attention to this vine, 15 eventhe stalk that your right hand planted, and concerning the shoot you strengthened for yourself. 16 It is burned with fire, cut down. They perish at the rebuke of your face. 17 Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of humankind whom you made strong for yourself. 18 Then we will not turn back from you.

His hands were freed from the basket. 7 In this trouble you called, and I rescued you. Within the secret place of thunder I answered you; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah 8 Hear, O my people, and I will admonish you; O Israel, if you would but listen to me. 9 There shall be no strange god among you, and you shall not bow down to a foreign god. 10 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt. Open wide your mouth and I will fill it. 11 But my people did not listen to my voice, and Israel did not yield to me. 12 So I let them go in the stubbornness of their heart; they walked in their counsels. 13 Oh that my people would listen to me; that Israel would walk in my ways. 14 I would subdue their enemies quickly, and turn my hand against their adversaries. 15 Those who hate Yahweh would cringe before him, and their fate would be forever. 16 But he would feed him from the choicest wheat, and I would satisfy you with honey from a rock.” ",Psalms 79-81,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/psalms-7981-363171/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-09-18_psalms-7981_20130829173457.mp3
Psalms,"A psalm of Asaph. 1 God stands in the divine assembly; he administers judgment in the midst of the gods. 2 “How long will you judge unjustly and show favoritism to the wicked? Selah 3 Judge on behalf of the helpless and the orphan; provide justice to the afflicted and the poor. 4 Rescue the helpless and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.” 5 They do not know or consider. They go about in the darkness, so that all the foundations of the earth are shaken. 6 I have said, “You are gods, and sons of the Most High, all of you. 7 However, you will die like men, and you will fall like one of the princes.” 8 Rise up, O God, judge the earth, because you shall inherit all the nations. A song. A psalm of Asaph. 1 O God, do not rest silently. Do not keep silent or be still, O God. 2 For look, your enemies roar, and those who hate you have lifted their head. 3 They devise cunning schemes against your people, and consult together against your protected ones. 4 They say, “Come, let us annihilate them from being a nation, so that the name of Israel will be remembered no more.” 5 For they have consulted together with a unified purpose. They have made a covenant against you: 6 the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites, 7 Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the inhabitants of Tyre. 8 Assyria also has joined with them. They provide help to the children of Lot. Selah 9 Do to them as you did with Midian, as with Sisera, as with Jabin at the wadi of Kishon. 10 They were destroyed at En-dor; they became dung for the ground. 11 Make their leaders like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their chiefs like Zebah and Zalmunna, 12 who said, “Let us take as our possession the pastures of God.” 13 O my God, make them like the tumbleweed, like the chaff before wind. 14 As fire burns a forest, and as a flame sets afire mountains, 15 so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm. 16 Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek your name, O Yahweh. 17 Let them be ashamed and terrified forever, and let them be humiliated and perish 18 that they may know that you, whose name is Yahweh, you alone, are the Most High over the whole earth.

You restored the fortunes of Jacob. 2 You took away the guilt of your people; you covered all their sin. Selah 3 You withdrew all your wrath; you turned from your burning anger. 4 Restore us, O God of our salvation, and annul your vexation with us. 5 Will you be angry against us forever? Will you prolong your anger generation after generation? 6 Will you not again revive us, that your people might rejoice in you? 7 Show us, O Yahweh, your loyal love, and grant us your salvation. 8 I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak, because he will speak peace to his people, even his faithful ones, but let them not return to folly. 9 Surely his salvation is near for those who fear him, that glory may abide in our land. 10 Loyal love and faithfulness will meet one another; righteousness and peace will kiss. 11 Faithfulness will sprout from the ground, and righteousness will look down from heaven. 12 Yes, Yahweh will give what is good, and our land will give its produce. 13 Righteousness will go before him, and it will make his steps a pathway.

Psalms,"A maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite. 1 I will sing forever of Yahweh’s acts of loyal love. From generation to generation I will make known your faithfulness with my mouth. 2 For I say, “Forever your loyal love is built up. The heavens you have established with your faithfulness in them.” 3 “I made a covenant with my chosen one; I swore an oath to David my servant: 4 ‘I will establish your descendants forever, and I will build up your throne from generation to generation.’ ” Selah 5 And so the heavens will praise your wonderful deed, O Yahweh, even your faithfulness, in the assembly of the holy ones. 6 For who in the sky is equal to Yahweh? Who is like Yahweh among the sons of God, 7 a God feared greatly in the council of the holy ones, and awesome above all surrounding him? 8 O Yahweh God of hosts, who is mighty like you, O Yah, with your faithfulness surrounding you? 9 You are ruling the surging of the sea. When its waves rise, you yourself still them. 10 You yourself crushed Rahab like one who is slain; you scattered your enemies with your strong arm. 11 The heavens are yours, the earth yours as well, the world with its fullness, because you founded them. 12 North and south, you created them; Tabor and Hermon shout joyfully over your name. 13 You have a mighty arm; Your hand is strong; your right hand reaches high. 14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne. Loyal love and faithfulness come before your face. 15 Blessed are the people who know the joyful shout; O Yahweh, they walk about in the light of your countenance. 16 In your name they rejoice all the day, and in your righteousness they rise up. 17 For you are the glory of their strength, and by your favor our horn rises up, 18 because our shield belongs to Yahweh, and our king to the Holy One of Israel. 19 Formerly you spoke in a vision to your faithful ones, and said, “I have bestowed help on a mighty man; I have exalted one chosen from the people. 20 I have found David, my servant. With my holy oil I have anointed him, 21 with whom my hand will be steadfast. Surely my arm will strengthen him. 22 The enemy will not deceive him, and no evil man will afflict him. 23 But I will crush his adversaries before him, and I will strike those who hate him. 24 And so my faithfulness and my loyal love will be with him, and in my name his horn will rise up. 25 And I will set his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers. 26 He will call out to me, ‘You are my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.’ 27 I will also make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. 28 Forever I will keep my loyal love for him, and my covenant will be reliable for him. 29 I will also establish his offspring forever, and his throne as the days of the heavens. 30 If his sons forsake my law and do not walk in my judgments, 31 if they defile my statutes and do not keep my commandments, 32 then I will punish their transgression with a rod, and their guilt with wounds. 33 But I will not break off my loyal love from him, and I will not be false against my faithfulness. 34 I will not defile my covenant, or alter what proceeded from my lips. 35 Once I have sworn by my holiness, ‘I will surely not lie to David, 36 His offspring will endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me. 37 Like the moon it will be steadfast forever, and like an enduring witness in the sky.’ ” Selah 38 But you have spurned and rejected; you are very angry with your anointed one. 39 You have repudiated the covenant with your servant; you have defiled his crown in the dirt. 40 You have broken down all his walls; you have made his fortifications a ruin. 41 All passing along the road plunder him; he has become a taunt to his neighbors. 42 You have raised the right hand of his adversaries. You have made all his enemies rejoice. 43 You have also turned back the edge of his sword and have not helped him stand his ground in the battle. 44 You have made his splendor to cease, and cast his throne to the ground. 45 You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with shame. Selah 46 How long, O Yahweh? Will you hide yourself forever? Will your wrath burn like fire forever? 47 Remember what my lifespan is. Remember for what vanity you have created all the children of humankind. 48 What man can live on and not see death? Can he deliver his life from the power of Sheol? Selah 49 Where are your former acts of loyal love, O Lord, that you swore to David by your faithfulness? 50 Remember, O Lord the taunting of your servants, how I bear in my bosom the taunts of all the many peoples, 51 by which your enemies taunt, O Yahweh, by which they taunt the steps of your anointed one. 52 Blessed be Yahweh forever. Amen and Amen. A prayer of Moses, the man of God. 1 O Lord, you have been our help in all generations. 2 Before the mountains were born and you brought forth the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God. 3 You return man to the dust, saying, “Return, O sons of man.” 4 For a thousand years in your eyes are like yesterday when it passes, or like a watch in the night. 5 You sweep them away like a flood. They fall asleep. In the morning they are like grass that sprouts anew. 6 In the morning it blossoms and sprouts anew; by evening it withers and dries up. 7 For we are brought to an end by your anger, and we hasten off by your wrath. 8 You have put our iniquities before you, our hidden sins into the light of your countenance. 9 For all of our days dwindle away in your rage; we complete our years like a sigh. 10 As for the days of our years, within them are seventy years or if by strength eighty years, and their pride is trouble and disaster, for it passes quickly and we fly away. 11 Who knows the strength of your anger, and your rage consistent with the fear due you? 12 So teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom. 13 Return, O Yahweh. How long? And have compassion on your servants. 14 Satisfy us in the morning with your loyal love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days. 15 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen calamity. 16 Let your work be visible to your servants, and your majesty to their children. 17 And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish for us the work of our hands, yes, the work of our hands, establish it.

Psalms,"1 One who lives in the secret place of the Most High will lodge in the shadow of Shaddai. 2 I will say to Yahweh, “You are my refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust.” 3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, from the plague of destruction. 4 With his feathers he will cover you, and under his wings you can take refuge. His faithfulness will be a shield and a buckler. 5 You need not fear the terror of the night, or the arrow that flies by day, 6 or the plague that spreads in the darkness, or the destruction that devastates at noon. 7 A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you. 8 You will only look with your eyes, and see the punishment of the wicked. 9 For you, O Yahweh, are my refuge. You have made the Most High your dwelling place. 10 No harm will befall you, and no plague will come near your tent. 11 For he will command his angels concerning you, to watch over you in all your ways. 12 In their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone. 13 You will tread on lion and viper; you will trample young lion and serpent. 14 Because he loves me, therefore I will deliver him; I will protect him because he knows my name. 15 He will call upon me and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue and honor him. 16 With long life I will satisfy him, and show him my salvation.

For the Sabbath day. 1 It is good to give thanks to Yahweh, and to sing praise concerning your name, O Most High; 2 to declare in the morning your loyal love and your faithfulness in the night, 3 on the ten string, and on the harp, with a melody on the lyre. 4 For you, O Yahweh, have made me glad by your work; by the deeds of your hands I sing for joy. 5 How great are your deeds, O Yahweh; how very deep are your thoughts. 6 The brutish man does not know, and the fool cannot understand this. 7 When the wicked flourish like grass and all the workers of evil blossom, it is so they can be destroyed forever. 8 But you are on high forever, O Yahweh. 9 For behold, your enemies, O Yahweh, for behold, your enemies will perish. All the workers of evil will be scattered. 10 But you have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; you have anointed me with fresh oil. 11 And so my eye looks on my enemies. My ears hear those evildoers who rise up against me. 12 The righteous will flourish like the date palm. They will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 13 Planted in the house of Yahweh, they will flourish in the courts of our God. 14 They will still prosper in old age. They will be fat and luxuriant, 15 to declare that Yahweh is upright. He is my rock, and there is no injustice in him. 1 Yahweh is king; he clothes himself with majesty. Yahweh clothes himself; he girds himself with might. Yes, the world is established so that it will not be moved. 2 Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting. 3 The rivers have lifted up, O Yahweh; the rivers have lifted up their rumbling; the rivers have lifted up their pounding. 4 Mightier than the rumblings of many waters, mightier than the mighty breakers of the sea, Yahweh on high is mighty. 5 Your testimonies are fully reliable. Holiness is fitting for your house, O Yahweh, forever. 1 O Yahweh, God of vengeance, God of vengeance, shine forth. 2 Rise up, O Judge of the earth. Repay upon the proud what is their rightful due. 3 How long will the wicked, O Yahweh, how long will the wicked exult? 4 They gush words unrestrained. All the evildoers boast. 5 They crush your people, O Yahweh; they oppress your inheritance. 6 They kill widow and stranger, and they murder orphans, 7 while they say, “Yah does not see,” and “The God of Jacob does not pay attention.” 8 You pay attention, O brutes among the people. And you fools, when you will show insight? 9 Will the one who planted the ear not hear? Will the one who formed the eye not see? 10 Will the one who instructs nations not rebuke, the one who teaches humankind knowledge? 11 Yahweh knows the thoughts of humankind, that they are to no purpose. 12 Blessed is the man, O Yah, whom you instruct and teach from your law, 13 to give him rest from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked. 14 For Yahweh will not abandon his people, nor forsake his inheritance. 15 For judgment will return to righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow after it. 16 Who rose up for me against the wicked? Who stood up for me against the workers of iniquity? 17 If Yahweh had not been my help, my soul would soon have dwelt in silence. 18 When I thought, “My foot is slipping,” your loyal love, O Yahweh, supported me. 19 When my troubled thoughts were many within me, your consolations cheered my soul. 20 Can there be allied with you a throne of destruction, one that forms trouble based on statute? 21 They band together against the life of the righteous, and declare the blameless guilty of blood. 22 But Yahweh has become my high stronghold, and my God has become my rock of refuge. 23 And he will repay on them their iniquity, and by their evil he will destroy them. Yahweh our God will destroy them. 1 Come, let us sing for joy to Yahweh; let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation. 2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; with songs let us shout joyfully to him. 3 For Yahweh is the great God, and the great king over all gods, 4 in whose hand are the unexplored places of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are his, 5 to whom belongs the sea that he made, and the dry land that his hands formed. 6 Come in, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Yahweh, our maker. 7 For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. Today if you will hear his voice: 8 “Do not harden your heart as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness, 9 when your ancestors tried me. They put me to the test, even though they had seen my work. 10 For forty years I loathed that generation, and said, ‘They are a people whose heart wanders. And my ways they do not know.’ 11 Therefore I swore in my anger, ‘They shall surely not enter into my rest.’ ” 1 Sing to Yahweh a new song; sing to Yahweh, all the earth. 2 Sing to Yahweh; bless his name. Announce his salvation from day to day. 3 Tell his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples. 4 For Yahweh is great and very worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods. 5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh made the heavens. 6 Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 7 Ascribe to Yahweh, you families of the peoples, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength. 8 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due his name; bring an offering and come into his courts. 9 Worship Yahweh in holy array; tremble before him, all the earth. 10 Say among the nations, “Yahweh is king! Yes, the world is established so that it will not be moved. He will judge the peoples fairly.” 11 Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice. Let the sea with its fullness roar. 12 Let the field with all that is in it exult. Then all the trees of the forests will sing for joy 13 before Yahweh, for he is coming; for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with his faithfulness. 1 Yahweh is king! Let the earth rejoice; let many coastlands be glad. 2 Cloud and thick darkness are surrounding him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. 3 Fire goes before him, and devours his enemies round about. 4 His lightnings light the world; the earth sees and trembles. 5 The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh, at the presence of the Lord of all the earth. 6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory. 7 Let all who serve an image be ashamed, those who boast about idols. Worship him, all you gods. 8 Zion hears and is glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments, O Yahweh. 9 For you, O Yahweh, are most high over all the earth. You are highly exalted above all gods. 10 You who love Yahweh, hate evil. He protects the lives of his faithful; he delivers them from the hand of the wicked. 11 Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart. 12 Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous, and give thanks to his holy name. A psalm. 1 Sing to Yahweh a new song, for he has done wonders. His right hand and his holy arm have secured his victory. 2 Yahweh has made known his salvation; to the eyes of the nations he has revealed his righteousness. 3 He has remembered his loyal love and his faithfulness to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 4 Shout joyfully to Yahweh, all the earth. Be cheerful and sing for joy and sing praises. 5 Sing praises to Yahweh with lyre, with lyre and melodious sound. 6 With trumpets and sound of horn, shout joyfully before the king, Yahweh. 7 Let the sea with its fullness roar, the world and those who live in it. 8 Let the rivers clap their hands. Let the hills sing joyfully together 9 before Yahweh, for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with equity. 1 Yahweh is king; let the peoples tremble. He sits enthroned between the cherubim. Let the earth shake. 2 Yahweh is great in Zion, and he is exalted over all the peoples. 3 Let them praise your great and fearful name. He is holy. 4 And the strength of the king loves justice. You have established equity; you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob. 5 Exalt Yahweh our God, and worship at his footstool. He is holy. 6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests; Samuel also was among those who called on his name. They called to Yahweh, and he answered them. 7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept his testimonies and the statute he gave to them. 8 O Yahweh our God, you answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, but an avenger of their wrong deeds. 9 Exalt Yahweh our God, and worship at his holy mountain, for Yahweh our God is holy.

Psalms,"A psalm of thanksgiving. 1 Shout in triumph to Yahweh, all the earth. 2 Serve Yahweh with joy; come into his presence with exultation. 3 Know that Yahweh, he is God; he made us and we are his. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture. 4 Enter his gates with thanksgiving, his courts with praise. Give thanks to him; bless his name. 5 For Yahweh is good; his loyal love is forever, and his faithfulness is from generation to generation. Of David. A psalm. 1 I will sing of loyal love and justice; I will sing praises to you, O Yahweh. 2 I will give attention to the way of integrity. When will you come to me? I will walk in the integrity of my heart in the midst of my house. 3 I will not set before my eyes any wicked thing. I hate the work of those who fall away; it will not cling to me. 4 A perverse heart will depart from me; I will not know evil. 5 One who slanders his neighbor in secret, him I will destroy. One haughty of eyes and arrogant of heart, him I will not endure. 6 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may live with me. He who walks in the way of integrity, he shall minister to me. 7 There will not live in the midst of my house a worker of deceit. One who speaks lies will not remain before my eyes. 8 Each morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land, cutting off from the city of Yahweh all evildoers. A prayer of one afflicted, when he grows faint and pours out his lament before Yahweh. 1 O Yahweh, hear my prayer, and let my cry for help come to you. 2 Do not hide your face from me in the day of my trouble. Incline your ear to me. In the day I call, answer me quickly, 3 for my days vanish in smoke, and my bones are charred like a hearth. 4 My heart is struck like grass and withers. Indeed, I forget to eat my bread. 5 Because of the sound of my groaning my bones cling to my skin. 6 I am like an owl of the wilderness; I am like a little owl of the ruins. 7 I lie awake and I am like a lone bird on a roof. 8 All the day my enemies reproach me; those who mock me swear oaths against me. 9 Indeed, I eat ashes like bread and mix my drink with tears 10 because of your indignation and anger, for you have picked me up and thrown me away. 11 My days are like a lengthened shadow, and I wither like grass. 12 But you, O Yahweh, abide forever, and your remembrance from generation to generation. 13 You rise up and take pity on Zion, because it is time to favor it, for the appointed time has come. 14 Your servants take pleasure in her stones, and show favor to its dust. 15 Then the nations will fear the name of Yahweh, and all the kings of the earth your glory. 16 For Yahweh will rebuild Zion; he will appear in his glory. 17 He will turn his attention to the prayer of the destitute and will not despise their prayer. 18 Let this be written for the next generation, so that a people yet to be created may praise Yah, 19 that he looked down from his holy height. Yahweh looked from heaven over the earth 20 to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to liberate those destined to die, 21 so that they may make known in Zion the name of Yahweh, and his praise in Jerusalem, 22 when the peoples assemble, together with kingdoms, to serve Yahweh. 23 He has broken my strength along the way; he has cut short my days. 24 I say, “My God, do not carry me off from my life in the middle of my days.” Your years continue throughout all generations. 25 Long ago you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. 26 They will perish, but you will endure. And like a garment they will all wear out, you will replace them like clothing, and they will be set aside. 27 But you are the same, and your years do not end. 28 The children of your servants will continue, and their descendants will be established before you.

Psalms,"Of David. 1 Bless Yahweh, O my soul, and all within me, bless his holy name. 2 Bless Yahweh, O my soul, and do not forget all his benefits: 3 who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, 4 who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with loyal love and mercies, 5 who satisfies your life with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s. 6 Yahweh does deeds of justice and judgments for all who are oppressed, 7 who made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel. 8 Yahweh is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love. 9 He does not dispute continually, nor keep his anger forever. 10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us according to our iniquities. 11 For as the heavens are high above the earth, so his loyal love prevails over those who fear him. 12 As far as east is from west, so he has removed far from us the guilt of our transgressions. 13 As a father pities his children, so Yahweh pities those who fear him. 14 For he knows our frame. He remembers that we are dust. 15 As for man, his days are like the grass. As the flower of the field, so he blossoms. 16 When the wind passes over it, it is no more, and its place knows it no longer. 17 But the loyal love of Yahweh is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to their children’s children, 18 to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his precepts. 19 Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all. 20 Bless Yahweh, you his angels, you mighty heroes who do his word by obeying the sound of his word. 21 Bless Yahweh, all you his hosts, you his attendants who do his will. 22 Bless Yahweh, all his works, in all the places of his dominion. Bless Yahweh, O my soul. 1 Bless Yahweh, O my soul. O Yahweh my God, you are very great. You clothe yourself with splendor and majesty, 2 you who cover yourself with light as with a garment, who stretch out the heavens like a tent curtain, 3 the one who sets beams in the waters for his upper chambers, who makes clouds his chariot, who rides on the wings of the wind, 4 who makes his messengers the winds, his attendants a flame of fire. 5 He established the earth on her foundations, so that it will not be moved forever and ever. 6 You covered it with the deep as with a garment. The waters stood above the mountains. 7 At your rebuke they fled; at the sound of your thunder they ran off. 8 They ascended the mountains and drained though the valleys to the place that you established for them. 9 You set a boundary that they may not cross over, so that they would not return to cover the earth. 10 You are the one who sends forth springs into the valleys; they flow between the mountains. 11 They give drink for every beast of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst. 12 Along them the birds of the heavens abide. From among the branches they sing. 13 You are the one who waters the mountains from his upper chambers. The earth is full with the fruit of your labors: 14 who causes grass to grow for the cattle and herbs for the service of humankind, to bring forth food from the earth, 15 and wine that makes glad the heart of man, so that their faces shine from oil, and bread that strengthens the heart of man. 16 The trees of Yahweh drink their fill, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted, 17 where birds make their nest. The stork has its home in the fir trees. 18 The high mountains are for the wild goats; the cliffs are a refuge for the rock badgers. 19 He made the moon for appointed times; the sun knows its time for setting. 20 You make darkness, and it is night, when all the animals of the forest creep about. 21 The young lions are roaring for the prey and seeking their food from God. 22 When the sun rises, they gather together and lie down in their dens. 23 Humankind goes out to its work, and to its labor until evening. 24 How many are your works, O Yahweh; all of them you have done in wisdom. The earth is full of your creatures. 25 This is the great and wide sea, in which are moving animals without number, living things small and great. 26 There the ships sail. Leviathan is there that you formed to play with. 27 They all wait for you to give them their food at the proper time. 28 You give to them; they gather it. You open your hand, they are filled with what is good. 29 You hide your face, they are terrified. You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust. 30 You send forth your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground. 31 May the glory of Yahweh endure forever. May Yahweh be glad in his works, 32 the one who looks at the earth and it quakes, and touches the mountains and they smoke. 33 I will sing to Yahweh throughout my life; I will sing praise to my God while I remain alive. 34 May my meditation be pleasing to him. I will be glad in Yahweh. 35 Let sinners perish completely from the earth, and the wicked not remain alive. Bless Yahweh, O my soul. Praise Yah. 1 Give thanks to Yahweh; proclaim his name; make known his deeds among the peoples. 2 Sing to him; sing praises concerning him; tell of all his wonderful works. 3 Boast about his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice. 4 Make supplication to Yahweh and his might; seek his face continually. 5 Remember his wonders that he has done, his signs and the judgments of his mouth, 6 O offspring of Abraham his servant, you descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones. 7 He is Yahweh our God; his judgments are in all the earth. 8 He remembers his covenant forever, the word that he commanded for a thousand generations, 9 that he made with Abraham, and by his oath swore to Isaac. 10 He then confirmed it to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, 11 saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan as the allotment that is your inheritance.” 12 When they were few in number— a trifle—and were sojourners in it, 13 and they wandered about among the nations, from one kingdom to another people, 14 he allowed no one to oppress them, and he rebuked kings on account of them, 15 “Do not touch my anointed ones, nor harm my prophets.” 16 Then he called for a famine upon the land; he broke every supply of bread. 17 He sent a man on ahead of them; Joseph was sold as a slave. 18 They clamped his feet in fetters. His neck went into irons. 19 Until the time his word came about, the word of Yahweh tested him. 20 The king sent and he freed him; the ruler of the peoples sent and let him loose. 21 He made him lord of his house and ruler of all his possessions, 22 to obligate his officials as he saw fit and teach his elders wisdom. 23 Then Israel came to Egypt, and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Ham. 24 And he made his people very fruitful. He also made them stronger than their enemies. 25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal deceitfully against his servants. 26 He sent his servant Moses, together with Aaron whom he had chosen. 27 They set before them the words concerning his signs and portents in the land of Ham. 28 He sent darkness and made it dark, and they did not rebel against his words. 29 He turned their waters into blood and it killed their fish. 30 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings. 31 He spoke, and there came flies and gnats throughout all their territory. 32 He gave hail for their rains and the fire of lightning in their land. 33 And he struck their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their territory. 34 He spoke and there came locusts and young locusts without number. 35 And they ate up all the vegetation in their land, and they ate up the fruit of their ground. 36 And he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the first of all their virility. 37 Then he brought them out with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled. 38 Egypt was glad when they departed, because the fear of them had fallen upon them. 39 He spread out a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light at night. 40 They asked, and he brought quail, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 41 He opened the rock and waters flowed; they coursed through the dry places like a river. 42 For he remembered his holy promise; he remembered Abraham his servant. 43 And so he brought out his people with joy, his chosen ones with rejoicing. 44 And he gave to them the lands of the nations, and they inherited the labor of the peoples, 45 so that they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise Yah. 1 Praise Yah. Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loyal love is forever. 2 Who can utter the mighty deeds of Yahweh, or proclaim all his praise? 3 Blessed are those who observe justice, he who does righteousness at all times. 4 Remember me, O Yahweh, when you show favor to your people. Look after me when you deliver, 5 that I may see the good done your chosen ones, to be glad in the joy of your nation, to glory together with your inheritance. 6 We have sinned along with our ancestors. We have committed iniquity; we have incurred guilt. 7 Our ancestors in Egypt did not understand your wonderful works. They did not remember your many acts of loyal love, and so they rebelled by the sea at the Red Sea. 8 Yet he saved them for the sake of his name, to make known his might. 9 So he rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up, and he led them through the deep as through a desert. 10 Thus he saved them from the hand of the hater and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 11 But waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived. 12 Then they believed his words; they sang his praise. 13 They quickly forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel. 14 And they craved intensely in the wilderness, and tested God in the desert. 15 So he gave to them their request, but he sent leanness into their souls. 16 And they were jealous of Moses in the camp, and of Aaron, the holy one of Yahweh. 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and it covered over the gang of Abiram. 18 Also fire burned in their assembly; the flame devoured the wicked. 19 They made a calf at Horeb and bowed down to a cast image. 20 And so they exchanged their glory for an image of an ox that eats grass. 21 They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt, 22 wonders in the land of Ham, awesome deeds by the Red Sea. 23 So he said he would exterminate them, had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to reverse his wrath from destroying them. 24 Then they refused the desirable land; they did not believe his word, 25 but grumbled in their tents. They did not obey the voice of Yahweh. 26 So he made an oath against them, to make them drop in the wilderness, 27 and to disperse their descendants among the nations and to scatter them among the lands. 28 They also attached themselves to Baal of Peor, and they ate sacrifices offered to the dead. 29 Thus they provoked to anger by their deeds, and a plague broke out among them. 30 Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and so the plague was stopped, 31 and it was reckoned to him as righteousness throughout all generations. 32 They also angered God at the waters of Meribah, and it went badly for Moses on account of them, 33 because they rebelled against his Spirit, and he spoke thoughtlessly with his lips. 34 They did not exterminate the peoples, as Yahweh had commanded them, 35 but they mingled with the nations and learned their works, 36 and served their idols, which became a snare to them. 37 They even sacrificed their sons and daughters to the demons, 38 and they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and so the land was defiled with the blood. 39 And they became unclean by their works, and were unfaithful in their deeds. 40 So Yahweh’s anger burned against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance. 41 Then he gave them into the hand of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them. 42 And their enemies oppressed them, and they were subdued under their hand. 43 Many times he delivered them, but they rebelled in their counsel, and were brought low by their iniquity. 44 Yet he looked upon their distress when he heard their cry. 45 And he remembered his covenant with them, and relented based on the abundance of his loyal love. 46 And he let them find compassion before all their captors. 47 Save us, O Yahweh our God, and gather us from the nations, so that we may give thanks to your holy name and boast in your praise. 48 Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. And let all the people say, “Amen!” Praise Yah.

Psalms,"1 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loyal love is forever. 2 Let the redeemed of Yahweh declare it, those whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy 3 and gathered from the lands, from east and from west, from north and from south. 4 They wandered in the wilderness, in a desert. They could find no way to a city to inhabit. 5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul grew faint within them. 6 Then they cried out to Yahweh in their trouble. He delivered them from their distresses 7 and led them by a straight way to get to a city to inhabit. 8 Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his loyal love, and his wonderful deeds for the children of humankind, 9 for he satisfies the longing soul, and the hungry soul he fills with good. 10 Those who sat in darkness and gloom, prisoners of misery and iron— 11 because they rebelled against the words of God and spurned the counsel of the Most High, 12 he therefore humbled their heart with trouble. They stumbled and there was no helper. 13 Then they called to Yahweh for help in their trouble; he saved them from their distresses. 14 He brought them out of darkness and gloom, and tore off their bonds. 15 Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his loyal love and his wonderful deeds for the children of humankind, 16 for he shatters the doors of bronze, and cuts through the bars of iron. 17 Fools, because of their rebellious way and their iniquities, were afflicted. 18 Their soul abhorred all food, and they approached the gates of death. 19 Then they called to Yahweh for help in their trouble. He saved them from their distresses. 20 He sent his word and healed them, and he delivered them from their pits. 21 Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his loyal love, and his wonderful deeds for the children of humankind, 22 and let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his works with rejoicing. 23 Those who went down to the sea in ships, doing business on the high seas; 24 they saw the works of Yahweh, and his wonderful deeds in the deep. 25 For he spoke and raised up a stormy wind, and it whipped up its waves. 26 They rose to the heavens; they plunged to the depths. Their soul melted in their calamity. 27 They reeled and staggered like a drunkard, and they were at their wits’ end. 28 Then they cried out to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distresses. 29 He made the storm be still and their waves became calm. 30 Then they were glad because they grew silent, so he guided them to their desired harbor. 31 Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his loyal love and his wonderful deeds for the children of humankind, 32 and let them exalt him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. 33 He turns rivers into a wilderness and springs of water into thirsty ground, 34 a fruitful land into a salty place, because of the evil of its inhabitants. 35 He turns a wilderness into a pool of water and a dry land into springs of water. 36 And he settles the hungry there, so that they may establish a city to inhabit, 37 and sow fields and plant vineyards, that they may yield fruit at harvest. 38 And he blesses them and they multiply greatly, and he does not let their cattle become few. 39 When they become few and they are bent down from the oppression of calamity and grief, 40 he pours contempt on princes and causes them to wander in a trackless waste. 41 But he protects the needy from misery, and he makes their families like a flock. 42 The upright see it and are glad, and all wickedness shuts its mouth. 43 Whoever is wise, then let him observe these things, and let them consider Yahweh’s acts of loyal love. A song. A psalm of David. 1 My heart is steadfast, O God. I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 2 Awake, harp and lyre. I will awake the dawn. 3 I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Yahweh; I will give you praise among the nations, 4 because your loyal love is great above the heavens, and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds. 5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God, and let your glory be above all the earth, 6 so that your beloved ones may be rescued. Save by your right hand and answer me. 7 God has spoken in his holiness, “I will exult, I will divide up Shechem, and portion out the valley of Succoth. 8 Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine. And Ephraim is the helmet for my head. Judah is my scepter; 9 Moab is my washing pot. Over Edom I will cast my sandal; Over Philistia I will shout in triumph.” 10 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 11 Have you not rejected us, O God, and not gone out with our armies, O God? 12 Give us help against the enemy, for the help of humankind is futile. 13 Through God we will do valiantly, and it is he who will tread down our enemies. For the music director. A psalm of David. 1 O God of my praise, do not keep silent, 2 for wicked and deceitful mouths have opened against me. They speak to me with a lying tongue. 3 They also surround me with words of hate, and fight me without cause. 4 In return for my love they accuse me, though I am in prayer. 5 So they inflicted evil against me in return for good and hatred in return for my love. 6 Appoint over him a wicked man, and let an accuser stand at his right hand. 7 When he is judged, let him come out guilty, and let his prayer become as sin. 8 Let his days be few; let another take his office. 9 Let his children be orphans, and his wife a widow, 10 and let his children wander aimlessly and beg, and let them plead from their ruins. 11 Let the creditor seize all that is his, and let strangers plunder his property. 12 Let there be none who extend to him loyal love, nor any who pities his orphans. 13 Let his descendants be cut off. Let their name be blotted out in the next generation. 14 Let the iniquity of his ancestors be remembered before Yahweh, and let the sin of his mother not be blotted out. 15 Let them be before Yahweh continually, that he may cut off their memory from the earth, 16 because he did not remember to show loyal love, but he pursued anyone, poor or needy or brokenhearted, to slay them. 17 Because he loved cursing, let it come upon him. Because he did not delight in blessing, let it be far from him. 18 Because he wore a curse as his robe, let it enter his body like water, and into his bones like oil. 19 May it be for him like a garment in which he wraps, and a belt he continually wears. 20 Let this be the punishment for my accusers from Yahweh, even those who speak evil against my life. 21 But you, O Yahweh my Lord, deal with me for your name’s sake. Because your loyal love is good, deliver me, 22 for I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. 23 Like a lengthening shadow I am passing away; I am shaken off like a locust. 24 My knees buckle from fasting, and my body grows lean without fat. 25 And so I am a disgrace to them; when they see me, they shake their heads. 26 Help me, O Yahweh my God; save me according to your loyal love, 27 that they may know that this is your hand, that you, O Yahweh, you have done it. 28 Let them curse, but you bless. When they arise, let them be put to shame, that your servant may be glad. 29 Let my accusers put on disgrace, and let them cover themselves with their shame as with a robe. 30 I will give thanks to Yahweh exceedingly with my mouth, and in the midst of many I will praise him, 31 for he stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those judging his life.

He will shatter the rulers of many countries. 7 He will drink from the stream by the road; therefore he will lift up his head. 1 Praise Yah! I will give thanks to Yahweh with all my heart, in the assembly of the upright and the congregation. 2 The works of Yahweh are great, studied by all who delight in them. 3 Full of splendor and majesty is his work, and his righteousness endures forever. 4 He has made his wonders to be remembered; Yahweh is gracious and compassionate. 5 He gives food to those who fear him; he remembers his covenant forever. 6 He has declared the power of his works for his people, by giving to them the inheritance of the nations. 7 The works of his hands are faithfulness and justice; all his precepts are reliable. 8 They are sustained forever and ever, done with faithfulness and uprightness. 9 He has sent redemption to his people; he has commanded his covenant forever; holy and fearful is his name. 10 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom; all who do them have a good understanding. His praise endures forever. 1 Praise Yah! Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh; he takes great delight in his commands. 2 His descendants will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed. 3 Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever. 4 His light rises in the darkness for the upright; he is gracious and compassionate and righteous. 5 It goes well for a man who is gracious and lends, who conducts his business properly. 6 For he will not be shaken forever; the righteous will be remembered forever. 7 He is not afraid of bad news; his heart is steadfast, secure in Yahweh. 8 His heart is sustained; he will not be afraid, until he looks in triumph on his enemies. 9 He gives lavishly to the needy; his righteousness endures forever. His horn rises high in honor. 10 The wicked sees it and is vexed. He gnashes his teeth and becomes weak. The desire of the wicked perishes. 1 Praise Yah! Praise, O servants of Yahweh, praise the name of Yahweh. 2 Let the name of Yahweh be blessed, from now until forever. 3 From the rising of the sun to its setting, let the name of Yahweh be blessed. 4 Yahweh is high above all nations; his glory is above the heavens. 5 Who is like Yahweh our God, who is enthroned on high, 6 who condescends to look at what is in the heavens and in the earth? 7 He raises the helpless from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap, 8 to seat them with princes, with the princes of his people. 9 He causes the barren woman of the house to dwell as the happy mother of children.

Psalms,"1 When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of a strange language, 2 Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 3 The sea looked and fled; the Jordan turned back. 4 The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. 5 What’s with you, O sea, that you fled? O Jordan, that you turned back? 6 O mountains, that you skipped like rams? O hills, like lambs? 7 At the presence of the Lord writhe, O earth, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 8 who turned the rock into a pool of water, flinty stone into a spring of water. 1 Not to us, O Yahweh, not to us, but to your name give glory, because of your loyal love, because of your faithfulness. 2 Why should the nations say, “Where, pray tell, is their God?” 3 But our God is in the heavens; all that he desires, he does. 4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands. 5 They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see; 6 they have ears, but cannot hear; they have noses, but cannot smell; 7 they have their hands, but they cannot feel, their feet, but they cannot walk; they cannot utter a sound in their throats. 8 Those who make them become like them, as does everyone who trusts in them. 9 O Israel, trust Yahweh; he is their help and their shield. 10 O house of Aaron, trust in Yahweh; he is their help and their shield. 11 You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh; he is their help and their shield. 12 Yahweh remembers us; he will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. 13 He will bless those who fear Yahweh, the small with the great. 14 May Yahweh give you increase, you and your children. 15 May you be blessed by Yahweh, who made heaven and earth. 16 The heavens are Yahweh’s heavens, but the earth he has given to the children of humankind. 17 The dead do not praise Yah, nor any descending into silence. 18 It is we, we will bless Yah from now until forever. Praise Yah! 1 I love him, because Yahweh has heard the voice of my supplications. 2 Because he has inclined his ear to me, I will call all my days. 3 The ropes of death encircled me, and the distresses of Sheol found me. I found trouble and grief. 4 Then I called on the name of Yahweh: “O Yahweh, please save my life!” 5 Gracious is Yahweh and righteous, and our God is merciful. 6 Yahweh watches over the simple. I was brought low, but he gave me victory. 7 Return, O my soul, to your repose, for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you. 8 For you have rescued me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling. 9 I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living. 10 I believed when I spoke, “I am afflicted greatly.” 11 I said in my haste, “Everyone is a liar.” 12 What shall I give back to Yahweh for all his benefits to me? 13 I will lift up the cup of salvation and proclaim the name of Yahweh. 14 I will pay my vows made to Yahweh in the presence of all his people. 15 Costly in Yahweh’s view is the death of his faithful ones. 16 Ah, Yahweh, I am indeed your servant; I am your servant, the child of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds. 17 I will offer to you a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and proclaim the name of Yahweh. 18 I will pay my vows made to Yahweh in the presence of all his people, 19 in the courts of the house of Yahweh, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.

Psalms,"1 Praise Yahweh, all you nations; extol him, all you peoples. 2 For his loyal love is mighty on our behalf, and the faithfulness of Yahweh is forever. Praise Yah! 1 Give thanks to Yahweh for he is good, for his loyal love is forever. 2 Let Israel say, “His loyal love is forever.” 3 Let the house of Aaron say, “His loyal love is forever.” 4 Let those who fear Yahweh say, “His loyal love is forever.” 5 Out of my distress I called to Yah. Yah answered me, setting me in a broad place. 6 Yahweh is for me; I do not fear. What can mere humans do to me? 7 Yahweh is for me as my helper, and so I will look in triumph on those who hate me. 8 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh than to trust in humans. 9 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh than to trust princes. 10 All nations surrounded me. In the name of Yahweh I opposed them indeed. 11 They surrounded me; yes, they surrounded me. In the name of Yahweh I opposed them indeed. 12 They surrounded me like bees; they were extinguished like a fire of thorns. In the name of Yahweh I opposed them indeed. 13 You pushed me hard to make me fall, but Yahweh helped me. 14 Yah is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation. 15 The sound of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous; the right hand of Yahweh has done valiantly. 16 The right hand of Yahweh has exalted; the right hand of Yahweh has done valiantly. 17 I will not die but live, and tell of the works of Yah. 18 Yah has disciplined me severely, but he did not consign me to death. 19 Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter through them and give thanks to Yah. 20 This is the gate of Yahweh, through which the righteous will enter. 21 I will give thanks to you for you have answered me, and you have become my salvation. 22 The stone the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. 23 This is from Yahweh; it is wonderful in our eyes. 24 This is the day Yahweh has worked; let us rejoice and be glad in him. 25 O Yahweh, please save; O Yahweh, please grant success. 26 Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh. We bless you from the house of Yahweh. 27 Yahweh is God, and he has given us light. Bind the festal sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar. 28 You are my God, and I will give thanks to you.

Psalms,"1 Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of Yahweh. 2 Blessed are those who keep his testimonies; they seek him with a whole heart. 3 They also do no wrong; they walk in his ways. 4 You have commanded your precepts, that we should keep them diligently. 5 Oh that my ways were steadfast, to keep your statutes! 6 Then I would not be ashamed when I look to all your commands. 7 I will give you thanks with an upright heart, when I learn your righteous laws. 8 I will heed your statutes; do not utterly forsake me. 9 How can a young man keep his way pure? By taking heed according to your word. 10 With my whole heart I have sought you; do not let me stray from your commands. 11 In my heart I have hidden your word, so that I may not sin against you. 12 Blessed are you, O Yahweh. Teach me your statutes. 13 With my lips I have told of all the ordinances of your mouth. 14 In the way of your testimonies I have rejoiced as I would over all riches. 15 I will meditate on your precepts and look at your ways. 16 I will take delight in your statutes; I will not forget your word. 17 Deal bountifully with your servant, that I may live and heed your word. 18 Uncover my eyes, that I may look at wonderful things from your law. 19 I am a sojourner on the earth; do not hide your commands from me. 20 My soul is crushed with longing for your ordinances at all times. 21 You rebuke the arrogant, the accursed, who stray from your commands. 22 Remove from me scorn and contempt, for I have kept your testimonies. 23 Even though princes sit and speak against me, your servant meditates on your statutes. 24 Your testimonies are my delight, my counselors. 25 My soul clings to the dust; revive me according to your word. 26 I told of my ways, and you answered me; teach me your statutes. 27 Make me understand the way of your precepts, that I may meditate on your wonderful things. 28 My soul weeps because of grief; strengthen me according to your word. 29 Remove from me the deceptive way, and graciously give me your law. 30 I have chosen the faithful way; I have set your ordinances before me. 31 I cling to your testimonies; O Yahweh, do not let me be put to shame. 32 I will run the way of your commands, for you will enlarge my heart. 33 Teach me, O Yahweh, the way of your statutes, and I will keep it to the end. 34 Give me understanding, that I may keep your law and heed it with my whole heart. 35 Cause me to walk in the path of your commands, for I delight in it. 36 Incline my heart to your testimonies, and not to dishonest gain. 37 Turn away my eyes from looking at what is worthless; revive me in your ways. 38 Fulfill your word to your servant, which is to bring about a reverence for you. 39 Turn away my disgrace that I dread, for your ordinances are good. 40 Look, I have longed for your precepts; revive me in your righteousness. 41 Let your acts of loyal love also come to me, O Yahweh, your salvation according to your word. 42 Then I will have an answer for the one who taunts me, for I trust your word. 43 And do not snatch the word of truth utterly from my mouth, for I hope in your ordinances. 44 So I will heed your law continually, forever and ever. 45 And I will go about freely, for I have sought your precepts. 46 And I will speak of your testimonies before kings, and will not be ashamed. 47 And I will take delight in your commands, which I love. 48 And I will lift up my hands to your commands, which I love, and I will meditate on your statutes. 49 Remember your word to your servant, upon which you have caused me to hope. 50 This is my comfort in my misery: that your word preserves my life. 51 The arrogant utterly deride me; I have not turned aside from your law. 52 I remember your ordinances of old, O Yahweh, and I take comfort. 53 Rage seizes me because of the wicked, those who forsake your law. 54 Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my sojourning. 55 I remember your name in the night, O Yahweh, and I heed your law. 56 This has been mine, that I have kept your precepts. 57 Yahweh is my portion; I intend to heed your words. 58 I seek your favor with my whole heart; be gracious to me according to your word. 59 I think about my ways, and turn my feet to your testimonies. 60 I hurry and do not delay to heed your commands. 61 The cords of the wicked surround me, but I do not forget your law. 62 In the middle of the night I rise to give you thanks, because of your righteous ordinances. 63 I am a companion of all who fear you and heed your precepts. 64 The earth, O Yahweh, is full of your loyal love. Teach me your statutes. 65 You have dealt well with your servant, O Yahweh, according to your word. 66 Teach me good discernment and knowledge, for I believe your commands. 67 Before I was afflicted, I was going astray, but now I heed your word. 68 You are good and do good; teach me your statutes. 69 The arrogant smear me with lies; I keep your precepts with my whole heart. 70 Their heart is insensitive like fat; As for me, I take delight in your law. 71 It is good for me that I was afflicted, so that I might learn your statutes. 72 The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver coins. 73 Your hands have made me and established me; give me understanding that I may learn your commands. 74 Those who fear you will see me and be glad, because I hope in your word. 75 I know, O Yahweh, that your judgments are right, and that in faithfulness you afflicted me. 76 Please let your loyal love comfort me, according to your word to your servant. 77 Let your mercies come to me, that I may live, for your law is my delight. 78 Let the arrogant be put to shame, because they have wronged me with lies. As for me, I will meditate on your precepts. 79 Let those who fear you turn to me, even those who know your testimonies. 80 May my heart be blameless in your statutes, so that I may not be ashamed. 81 My soul languishes for your salvation; I hope in your word. 82 My eyes long for your word, saying, “When will you comfort me?” 83 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, yet I have not forgotten your statutes. 84 How many are the days of your servant? When will you execute justice against those who persecute me? 85 The arrogant have dug pits for me, which is not according to your law. 86 All your commands are faithful. They persecute me deceitfully; help me! 87 They have almost destroyed me on the earth, but I have not forsaken your precepts. 88 According to your loyal love preserve me alive, so that I may heed the testimony from your mouth. 89 Forever, O Yahweh, your word is settled in heaven. 90 Your faithfulness endures throughout all generations. You have established the earth and it stands. 91 By your ordinances they stand today, for all are your servants. 92 Unless your law had been my delight, then I would have perished in my misery. 93 I will not ever forget your precepts, for by them you revive me. 94 I am yours. Save me, for I have sought your precepts. 95 For me the wicked lie in wait to destroy me. I give attention to your testimonies. 96 I have seen a limit to every perfection; your command is very broad. 97 How I love your law!

Of David. 1 I rejoiced in those who said to me, “Let us go to the house of Yahweh.” 2 Our feet are standing within your gates, O Jerusalem— 3 Jerusalem that is built as a city that is joined together, 4 where the tribes go up, the tribes of Yah as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of Yahweh. 5 For there the thrones sit for judgment, thrones of David’s house. 6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May those who love you be at ease. 7 May peace be within your walls, security within your palaces.” 8 For the sake of my brothers and my friends, I will say, “Peace be within you.” 9 For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek your good. A song of ascents. 1 I lift up my eyes to you, the one enthroned in the heavens. 2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to Yahweh our God, until he is gracious to us. 3 Be gracious to us, O Yahweh, be gracious to us, for long enough we have had our fill of contempt. 4 For long enough our soul has had its fill of the derision of the self-confident, the contempt of the arrogant.

A song of ascents. Of David. 1 “If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,” do let Israel say, 2 “If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when men rose up against us, 3 then they would have swallowed us alive, when their anger was kindled against us. 4 Then the waters would have flooded over us, the torrent would have passed over our soul. 5 Then over our soul would have passed the raging waters.” 6 Blessed be Yahweh, who has not made us prey for their teeth. 7 Our soul has escaped like a bird from the snare of fowlers. The snare is broken, and we have escaped. 8 Our help is in the name of Yahweh, maker of heaven and earth. A song of ascents. 1 Those who trust in Yahweh are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever. 2 As mountains are round about Jerusalem, so Yahweh is round about his people, from now until forever. 3 For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the land of the righteous, lest the righteous stretch out their hands to do wickedness. 4 Do good, O Yahweh, to the good, and to those upright in their hearts. 5 But regarding those who turn aside to their crooked ways, Yahweh will lead them away with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel. A song of ascents. 1 When Yahweh restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers. 2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with rejoicing. Then they said among the nations, “Yahweh has done great things for these people.” 3 Yahweh has done great things for us; we are glad. 4 Restore, O Yahweh, our fortunes like the streams in the Negeb. 5 Those who sow with tears shall reap with rejoicing. 6 He who diligently goes out with weeping, carrying the seed bag, shall certainly come in with rejoicing, carrying his sheaves. A song of ascents. Of Solomon. 1 Unless Yahweh builds a house, its builders labor at it in vain. Unless Yahweh guards a city, a guard watches in vain. 2 It is in vain for you who rise early and sit late, eating the bread of anxious toil, when thus he provides for his beloved in his sleep. 3 Look, children are the heritage of Yahweh; the fruit of the womb is a reward. 4 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of one’s youth. 5 Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them. They shall not be put to shame when they speak with enemies at the gate. A song of ascents. 1 Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh, who walks in his ways. 2 You will indeed eat of the labor of your hands; you will be happy and it will be well with you. 3 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house. Your children will be like olive shoots about your table. 4 Look, for thus shall a man be blessed who fears Yahweh. 5 May Yahweh bless you from Zion, that you may see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life, 6 and that you may see your children’s children. May peace be upon Israel. A song of ascents. 1 “Too often they have attacked me from my youth.” Let Israel say, 2 “Too often they have attacked me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me. 3 On my back plowmen have plowed. They have made their furrows long.” 4 Yahweh is righteous. He has cut the ropes of the wicked. 5 Let all be put to shame and repulsed who hate Zion. 6 Let them be like grass on the housetops, that withers before it grows up, 7 with which a reaper cannot fill his hand, nor the binder of sheaves his arms, 8 so that passersby do not say, “The blessing of Yahweh be upon you. We bless you in the name of Yahweh.” A song of ascents. 1 Out of the depths I call to you, O Yahweh. 2 “O Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 3 If you, O Yah, should keep track of iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? 4 But with you is forgiveness, so that you may be feared.” 5 I await Yahweh; my soul awaits, and I wait for his word. 6 My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning. Yes, more than watchmen for the morning. 7 O Israel, wait for Yahweh. For with Yahweh there is loyal love, and with him there is abundant redemption. 8 And he will redeem Israel from all its iniquities. A song of ascents. Of David. 1 O Yahweh, my heart is not haughty nor my eyes arrogant. And I do not concern myself with things too great and difficult for me. 2 Rather I have soothed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother, like the weaned child is my soul with me. 3 O Israel, hope in Yahweh from now until forever.

Psalms,"A song of ascents. 1 O Yahweh, remember with regard to David all his affliction. 2 How he swore to Yahweh, he vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: 3 “I will not enter into the tent of my house, I will not go up to the couch of my bed, 4 I will give no sleep to my eyes, no slumber to my eyelids, 5 until I find a place for Yahweh, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” 6 Look, we heard of it in Ephrathah; we found her in the fields of Jaar. 7 Let us go to his dwelling places; Let us worship at his footstool. 8 Arise, O Yahweh, to your resting place, you and your mighty ark. 9 Let your priests clothe themselves with righteousness, and let your faithful sing for joy. 10 For the sake of your servant David, do not turn away the face of your anointed one. 11 Yahweh swore in truth to David; he will not turn back from it. “One from the fruit of your body I will set on your throne. 12 If your sons will heed my covenant and my testimonies that I will teach them, their sons also forever will sit on your throne.” 13 For Yahweh has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his habitation. 14 “This is my resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it. 15 I will bless its provisions abundantly; I will satisfy its poor with bread. 16 I will also clothe its priests with salvation, and its faithful will shout exuberantly for joy. 17 There I will cause a horn to grow for David; I will set a lamp for my anointed one. 18 I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on him his crown will flourish.” A song of ascents. Of David. 1 Look, how good and how pleasant it is when brothers dwell together in unity. 2 It is like the fragrant oil upon the head, running down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron, that runs down upon the edges of his robes. 3 It is like the dew of Hermon that runs down upon the mountains of Zion, because there Yahweh commanded the blessing— life forever. A song of ascents. 1 Look, bless Yahweh, all you the servants of Yahweh, who serve in the house of Yahweh by night. 2 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless Yahweh. 3 May Yahweh bless you from Zion, he who made heaven and earth. 1 Praise Yah! Praise the name of Yahweh. Praise him, O servants of Yahweh, 2 who stand in the house of Yahweh, in the courts of the house of our God. 3 Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good. Sing praises concerning his name, for it is pleasant. 4 For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel as his special possession. 5 For I know that Yahweh is great, and our Lord is greater than all gods. 6 All that Yahweh desires, he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the depths. 7 He causes clouds to rise from the edge of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain; he brings out the wind from his storehouses. 8 Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of humans and animals. 9 He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants. 10 Who struck many nations and killed mighty kings— 11 Sihon the king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan— 12 and he gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance for his people Israel. 13 O Yahweh, your name endures forever, O Yahweh, your renown throughout all generations, 14 for Yahweh will plead the cause of his people and will have compassion on his servants. 15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of the hands of humankind. 16 They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see; 17 they have ears, but cannot hear; there is not even breath in their mouths. 18 Those who make them become like them, as does everyone who trusts in them. 19 O house of Israel, bless Yahweh. O house of Aaron, bless Yahweh. 20 O house of Levi, bless Yahweh. You who fear Yahweh, bless Yahweh. 21 Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise Yah! 1 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loyal love endures forever. 2 Give thanks to the God of gods, for his loyal love endures forever. 3 Give thanks to the Lord of lords, for his loyal love endures forever. 4 To him who alone does great wonders, for his loyal love endures forever. 5 To him who made the heavens with skill, for his loyal love endures forever. 6 To him who spread out the earth above the waters, for his loyal love endures forever. 7 To him who made the great lights, for his loyal love endures forever. 8 The sun to rule the day, for his loyal love endures forever. 9 The moon and stars to rule the night, for his loyal love endures forever. 10 To him who struck Egypt through their firstborn, for his loyal love endures forever. 11 And he brought Israel out from among them, for his loyal love endures forever. 12 With a strong hand and an outstretched arm, for his loyal love endures forever. 13 To him who divided the Red Sea in two, for his loyal love endures forever. 14 And he let Israel cross over through the midst of it, for his loyal love endures forever. 15 But he tossed Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea, for his loyal love endures forever. 16 To him who led his people through the wilderness, for his loyal love endures forever. 17 To him who struck great kings, for his loyal love endures forever. 18 And he killed mighty kings, for his loyal love endures forever. 19 Sihon the king of the Amorites, for his loyal love endures forever. 20 And Og the king of Bashan, for his loyal love endures forever. 21 And he gave their land as an inheritance, for his loyal love endures forever. 22 An inheritance to Israel his servant, for his loyal love endures forever. 23 Who remembered us in our low estate, for his loyal love endures forever. 24 And he rescued us from our enemies, for his loyal love endures forever. 25 The one who gives food to all flesh, for his loyal love endures forever. 26 Give thanks to the God of heaven, for his loyal love endures forever.

Psalms,"1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat, yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 2 On the willows in her midst, we hung up our lyres. 3 For there our captors asked of us words of a song, and our tormentors asked of us jubilation, “Sing for us from a song of Zion.” 4 How could we sing the song of Yahweh in a foreign land? 5 If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget. 6 Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, if do not I exalt Jerusalem above my highest joy. 7 Remember, O Yahweh, against the sons of Edom the day of Jerusalem, the ones who said, “Lay it bare! Lay it bare to its foundation!” 8 O daughter of Babylon, about to be devastated, happy shall be he who pays back to you what you paid out to us. 9 Happy shall be he who seizes and smashes your children against the rock.  Of David. 1 I give you thanks with my whole heart; before the gods I sing your praise. 2 I bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name, because of your loyal love and faithfulness, for you have magnified your word according to all your name. 3 When I called and you answered me, you emboldened me in my soul with strength. 4 All the kings of the earth will praise you, O Yahweh, when they have heard the words of your mouth, 5 and they will sing of the ways of Yahweh, because Yahweh’s glory is great. 6 Though Yahweh is high, yet he sees the lowly, but the proud he perceives at a distance. 7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve me alive. You stretch out your hand against the anger of my enemies, and you save me with your right hand. 8 Yahweh accomplishes things for my benefit.

A psalm. 1 O Yahweh, you have searched me, and you know me. 2 You know my sitting down and my rising up. You understand my thought from afar. 3 You search out my wandering and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways. 4 For there is not a word yet on my tongue, but behold, O Yahweh, you know it completely. 5 You barricade me behind and in front, and set your hand upon me. 6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is set high; I cannot prevail against it. 7 Where can I go from your Spirit, or where can I flee from your presence? 8 If I ascend to heaven, there you are, and if I make my bed in Sheol, look! There you are. 9 If I lift up the wings of the dawn, and I alight on the far side of the sea, 10 even there your hand would lead me, and your right hand would hold me fast. 11 And if I should say, “Surely darkness will cover me, and the light around me will be as night,” 12 even the darkness is not too dark for you, and the night shines as the day— the darkness and the light are alike for you. 13 Indeed you created my inward parts; you wove me in my mother’s womb. 14 I praise you, because I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works, and my soul knows it well. 15 My frame was not hidden from you, when I was created secretly, and intricately woven in the depths of the earth. 16 Your eyes saw my embryo, and in your book they all were written— days fashioned for me when there was not one of them. 17 And to me, how precious are your thoughts, O God; how vast is their sum. 18 If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand. I awaken, and I am still with you. 19 If only you would kill the wicked, O God— so get away from me, you bloodthirsty men— 20 who speak against you deceitfully. Your enemies take your name in vain. 21 Do I not hate those who hate you, O Yahweh? And do I not loathe those who rise up against you? 22 I hate them with a complete hatred; they have become my enemies. 23 Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. 24 And see if there is in me the worship of false gods, and lead me in the way everlasting.

Psalms,"For the music director. A psalm of David. 1 Rescue me, O Yahweh, from evil men. Preserve me from violent men, 2 who plan evil things in their heart. They stir up wars continually. 3 They sharpen their tongue as sharp as a snake’s; the venom of a viper is under their lips. Selah 4 Protect me, O Yahweh, from the hands of the wicked. Preserve me from violent men, who have planned to make me stumble. 5 The proud have hidden a trap for me, and cords. They have spread out a net along the side of the path. They have set snares for me. Selah 6 I say to Yahweh, “You are my God.” Listen, O Yahweh, to the voice of my supplications. 7 O Yahweh, my Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle. 8 Do not grant, O Yahweh, the desires of the wicked. Do not allow them to attain their plan, lest they be exalted. Selah 9 With respect to the head of those who surround me, may the harm of their lips cover them. 10 Let burning coals fall on them; let them be dropped into the fire, into bottomless pits from which they cannot rise. 11 Do not let a slanderer be established in the land; as for the man of violence, let evil hunt him quickly. 12 I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and justice for the needy. 13 Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name; the upright will dwell in your presence. A psalm of David. 1 I call on you, O Yahweh; hasten to me. Listen to my voice when I call to you. 2 Let my prayer be set before you as incense, the lifting up of my palms as the evening offering. 3 Set a guard, O Yahweh, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips. 4 Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked deeds with men who do iniquity; and do not let me eat of their delicacies. 5 Let a righteous one strike me in kindness, and let him chasten me. It is oil for my head; let not my head refuse. For still my prayer is against their evil deeds. 6 When their judges are thrown down the sides of a cliff, then they will understand that my words were pleasant. 7 As when one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol. 8 But my eyes are toward you, O Yahweh, my Lord; I have taken refuge in you. Do not lay bare my soul. 9 Protect me from the grasp of the trap they have laid for me, and from the snares of evildoers. 10 Let the wicked fall into their nets, while I escape altogether. A maskil of David. When he was in the cave. A prayer. 1 I cry out with my voice to Yahweh; I implore favor with my voice to Yahweh. 2 I pour out my complaint before him; I declare my trouble before him. 3 When my spirit faints within me, you know my way. On the path where I walk, they have hidden a trap for me; 4 look to my right and see. There is no one looking out for me; there is no escape for me; no one cares for my soul. 5 I cry out to you, O Yahweh. I say, “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.” 6 Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low. Deliver me from my pursuers, for they are stronger than I. 7 Bring me out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will encircle me, because you will deal bountifully with me. A psalm of David. 1 O Yahweh, hear my prayer; listen to my supplications. In your faithfulness answer me, and in your righteousness. 2 And do not enter into judgment with your servant, because no one alive is righteous before you. 3 For the enemy has pursued my soul; he has crushed my life to the ground. He has made me dwell in dark places like those long dead. 4 And so my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is desolate. 5 I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your doings. I muse on the labor of your hands. 6 I stretch out my hands to you; my soul longs for you like a dry land. Selah 7 Quickly answer me, O Yahweh; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me, or I will become like those descending to the pit. 8 Cause me to hear your loyal love in the morning, for I trust you. Cause me to know the way that I should go, for I lift up my soul to you. 9 Deliver me from my enemies, O Yahweh. I take refuge in you. 10 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; your Spirit is good. Lead me onto level ground. 11 For your name’s sake, O Yahweh, preserve my life; in your righteousness bring me out of trouble. 12 And in your loyal love destroy my enemies, and exterminate all the adversaries of my soul, for I am your servant.

Psalms,"Of David. 1 Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, the one who trains my hands for battle, my fingers for war— 2 my loyal love and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, and one in whom I take refuge, the one who subdues peoples under me. 3 O Yahweh, what is humankind that you take knowledge of him, or the son of man that you take thought of him? 4 Humankind is like a breath, his days like a passing shadow. 5 O Yahweh, bow the heavens and come down; touch the mountains so that they smoke. 6 Flash forth lightning and scatter them; dispatch your arrows and rout them. 7 Stretch out your hands from on high; Rescue me and deliver me from many waters, from the hand of foreigners, 8 whose mouth speaks falsely, and their right hand is a false right hand. 9 O God, I will sing a new song to you. With a lyre of ten strings I will sing praise to you, 10 who gives victory to kings, who rescues David his servant from the evil sword. 11 Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of foreigners, whose mouth speaks falsely, and whose right hand is a false right hand, 12 that our sons may be like plants, full grown in their youth, our daughters like corner pillars, carved in the style of a palace, 13 that our granaries may be full, providing produce of all kinds, that our sheep may produce by the thousands, by the tens of thousands in our open fields, 14 that our cattle may be pregnant; that there be no breach in our walls, and no going out in exile, and no outcry in our plazas. 15 Blessed are the people who have it thus. Blessed are the people whose God is Yahweh. A praise of David. 1 I will exalt you, my God, O king, and I will bless your name forever and ever. 2 Every day I will bless you and praise your name forever and ever. 3 Great is Yahweh, and very worthy of praise, and his greatness is unsearchable. 4 One generation will laud your works to another, and will declare your mighty deeds. 5 On the splendor of the glory of your majesty, and on your wonderful deeds, I will meditate. 6 And they will speak of the power of your awesome deeds, and I will tell of your greatness. 7 They will utter the renown of your abundant goodness, and they will proclaim with joy your righteousness. 8 Yahweh is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in loyal love. 9 Yahweh is good to all, and his mercies are over all his works. 10 All your works will praise you, O Yahweh, and your faithful ones will bless you. 11 They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, and talk of your power, 12 to make known to the children of humankind his mighty deeds, and the glory of the majesty of his kingdom. 13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures throughout all generations. 14 Yahweh upholds all who are falling, and raises up all who are bowed down. 15 The eyes of all look hopefully to you, and you give them their food in due time, 16 opening your hand, and satisfying the desire of every living creature. 17 Yahweh is righteous in all his ways, and loyal in all his works. 18 Yahweh is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. 19 He fulfills the desire of those who fear him; he also hears their cry for help, and saves them. 20 Yahweh protects all those who love him, but all the wicked he will exterminate. 21 My mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh, and all flesh will bless his holy name forever and ever. 1 Praise Yah. Praise Yahweh, O my soul. 2 I will praise Yahweh while I live; I will sing praises to my God while I am still alive. 3 Do not place trust in princes, in a son of humankind with whom there is no deliverance. 4 His breath departs; he returns to his plot; on that day his plans perish. 5 Blessed is the one whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is on Yahweh as his God, 6 who made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them, the one who keeps faith forever, 7 who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food for the hungry. Yahweh sets prisoners free; 8 Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind; Yahweh raises up those bowed down; Yahweh loves the righteous; 9 Yahweh protects the strangers. He helps up the orphan and the widow, but the way of the wicked he thwarts. 10 Yahweh will reign forever, Your God, O Zion, throughout all generations. Praise Yah. 1 Praise Yah. For it is good to sing praises to our God; for it is pleasant; praise is fitting. 2 Yahweh is building Jerusalem; he gathers the scattered ones of Israel. 3 He is the one who heals the brokenhearted, and binds up their wounds. 4 He counts the number of the stars; he gives names to all of them. 5 Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is unlimited. 6 Yahweh helps the afflicted up; he brings the wicked down to the ground. 7 Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving; sing praises to our God with lyre, 8 who covers the heavens with clouds, who provides rain for the earth, who causes grass to grow on the mountains. 9 He gives to the animal its food, and to the young ravens that cry. 10 He does not delight in the strength of the horse; he takes no pleasure in the legs of the man. 11 Yahweh takes pleasure in those who fear him, the ones who hope for his loyal love. 12 Laud Yahweh, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion, 13 for he strengthens the bars of your gates. He blesses your children within you; 14 he makes your border peaceful; he satisfies you with the finest of wheat. 15 He sends out his command to the earth; his word runs swiftly. 16 He gives snow like wool; he scatters frost like ashes; 17 he throws his hail like crumbs. Who can stand before his cold? 18 He sends out his word and melts them; he blows his breath, the water flows. 19 He declares his word to Jacob, his statutes and his ordinances to Israel. 20 He has not done so for any nation, and they do not know his ordinances. Praise Yah. 1 Praise Yah.

His splendor is above earth and heavens. 14 And he has raised high a horn for his people, praise for all his faithful— for the children of Israel, a people close to him. Praise Yah. 1 Praise Yah. Sing to Yahweh a new song, his praise in the assembly of the faithful. 2 Let Israel be glad in its maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their king. 3 Let them praise his name with dancing; let them sing praises to him with tambourine and lyre. 4 For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people; he glorifies the afflicted with salvation. 5 Let the faithful exult in glory; let them sing for joy on their beds. 6 Let the extolling of God be in their throat, and a double-edged sword in their hand, 7 to execute vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, 8 to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron, 9 to execute on them the judgment that is decreed. This will be honor for all his faithful ones; Praise Yah. 1 Praise Yah. Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty firmament. 2 Praise him for his mighty deeds; praise him according to the abundance of his greatness. 3 Praise him with blast of horn; praise him with harp and lyre. 4 Praise him with tambourine and dancing; praise him with strings and flute. 5 Praise him with sounding cymbals; praise him with clashing cymbals. 6 Every breathing thing, let it praise Yah.

Amen. 6 I am astonished that you are turning away so quickly from the one who called you by the grace of Christ to a different gospel, 7 not that there is a different gospel, except there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim a gospel to you contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let him be accursed! 9 As we said before, and now I say again, if anyone is proclaiming a gospel to you contrary to what you have received, let him be accursed! 10 For am I now making an appeal to people or to God?

Galatians,"11 For I make known to you, brothers, the gospel that has been proclaimed by me, that it is not of human origin. 12 For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. 13 For you have heard about my former way of life in Judaism, that to an extraordinary degree I was persecuting the church of God, and trying to destroy it, 14 and was progressing in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my nation, because I was a far more zealous adherent of the traditions handed down by my forefathers. 15 But when the one who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace was pleased 16 to reveal his Son in me in order that I would proclaim the gospel about him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood, 17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia and I returned again to Damascus. 18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days, 19 but I did not see any others of the apostles except James, the brother of the Lord. 20 (Now the things which I am writing to you, behold, I assure you before God that I am not lying.) 21 Then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia, 22 but I was unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ, 23 and they were only hearing, “The one formerly persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith that formerly he was attempting to destroy,” 24 and they were glorifying God because of me.

Galatians,"1 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking along Titus also. 2 Now I went up there because of a revelation and laid out to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles, but in private to the influential people, lest somehow I was running, or had run, in vain. 3 But not even Titus who was with me, although he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. 4 Now this was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, in order that they might enslave us, 5 to whom not even for an hour did we yield in subjection, in order that the truth of the gospel might remain continually with you. 6 But from those who were influential (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me, God does not show partiality)—for those who were influential added nothing to me. 7 But these, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcision, just as Peter to the circumcision 8 (for the one who was at work through Peter for his apostleship to the circumcision was at work also through me for the Gentiles), 9 and when James and Cephas and John—those thought to be pillars—acknowledged the grace given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, in order that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision. 10 They asked only that we should remember the poor, the very thing I was also eager to do. 11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was condemned. 12 For before certain people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles, but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, because he was afraid of those who were of the circumcision, 13 and the rest of the Jews also joined in this hypocrisy with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with them in their hypocrisy. 14 But when I saw that they were not being straightforward with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of them all, “If you, although you are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you try to compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?” ",Galatians 2:1-14,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/galatians-21-14-351505/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-07-08_galatians-21-14_20130626232905.mp3

May it never be! 18 For if I build up again these things which I destroyed, I show myself to be a transgressor. 19 For through the law I died to the law, in order that I might live to God.

Galatians,"8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the good news in advance to Abraham: “In you all the nations will be blessed.” 9 So then, the ones who have faith are blessed together with Abraham who believed. 10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things that are written in the book of the law to do them.” 11 Now it is clear that no one is justified in the sight of God by the law, because “the one who is righteous will live by faith.” 12 But the law is not from faith, but “the one who does these things will live by them.” 13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, because it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,” 14 in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 15 Brothers, I am speaking according to a human perspective. Nevertheless, when the covenant of a man has been ratified, no one declares it invalid or adds additional provisions to it. 16 Now to Abraham and to his descendant the promises were spoken.

It was added on account of transgressions, until the descendant should come to whom it had been promised, having been ordered through angels by the hand of a mediator. 20 Now the mediator is not for one, but God is one. 21 Therefore is the law opposed to the promises of God?

That man was blameless and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil. 2 And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. 3 Then his livestock came to be seven thousand sheep and goats and three thousand camels and five hundred pairs of oxen and five hundred female donkeys, and he had very many slaves, and that man was greater than all the people of the east. 4 And his sons used to go and hold a feast at each other’s house on his day, and they would send, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 5 Then when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send, and he would sanctify them. Thus he would arise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of all of them, because Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their heart.” This is what Job used to do all the time.

Job,"6 And it happened one day that the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan also came into their midst. 7 So Yahweh said to Satan, “From where have you come?” Then Satan answered Yahweh and said, “From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it.” 8 So Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? Indeed, there is no one like him on the earth—a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil.” 9 Then Satan answered Yahweh and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? 10 Have you not put a fence around him and his household and around all that belongs to him on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock has increased in the land. 11 But, on the other hand, stretch out your hand and touch all that belongs to him and see whether he will curse you to your face.” 12 So Yahweh said to Satan, “Look, all that belongs to him is in your power. Only do not stretch out your hand against him.” So Satan went out from Yahweh’s presence. 13 And then there was one day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother’s house. 14 And a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the female donkeys were feeding beside them. 15 Then the Sabeans attacked, and they took them, and they slew the servants by the edge of the sword. But I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.” 16 While this one was still speaking, another came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens, and it blazed up against the sheep and goats and against the servants, and it consumed them. But I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.” 17 While this one was still speaking, another came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three divisions, and they made a raid on the camels, and they carried them away, and they struck your servants by the edge of the sword, but I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.” 18 At the time this one was speaking, another came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother’s house. 19 And behold, a great wind came from across the desert, and it struck the four corners of the house so that it fell upon the young people, and they died. But I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.” 20 Then Job arose and tore his outer garment and shaved his head; then he fell upon the ground and he worshiped. 21 Then he said, “Naked I came out from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. Yahweh gives, and Yahweh takes. Let Yahweh’s name be blessed.” 22 In all this, Job did not sin and did not charge God with wrongdoing. 1 And then one day the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan also came into their midst to present himself before Yahweh. 2 So Yahweh asked Satan, “From where have you come?” And Satan answered Yahweh and said, “From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it.” 3 So Yahweh asked Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? Indeed, there is no one like him on the earth—a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil. And still he persists in his blamelessness even though you incited me against him to destroy him for nothing.” ",Job 1:6-2:3,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/job-1623-343425/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-06-03_job-1623_20130512211056.mp3
Job,"4 Then Satan answered him and said, “Skin for skin! All that that man has he will give for his life. 5 But stretch out your hand and touch his bones and his flesh, and see whether he will curse you to your face.” 6 So Yahweh said to Satan, “All right, he is in your power. Only spare his life.” 7 So Satan went out from Yahweh’s presence, and he inflicted Job with loathsome skin sores from the sole of his foot up to the crown of his head. 8 So he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat in the midst of the ashes. 9 Then his wife said to him, “Are you still persisting in your blamelessness? Curse God and die.” 10 So he said to her, “You speak like one of the foolish women speaks. Indeed, should we receive the good from God, but not receive the evil?” In all this, Job did not sin with his lips. 11 Thus Job’s three friends heard of this calamity that had come upon him. So each set out from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite. And they met together to come to console him and to comfort him. 12 Thus they lifted up their eyes from afar, but they did not recognize him, so they raised their voice, and they wept, and each man tore his outer garment and threw dust on their heads toward the sky. 13 Then they sat with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw that his suffering was very great. 1 Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed his day. 2 Thus Job spoke up and said, 3 “Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said, ‘A man-child is conceived.’ 4 Let that day become darkness; may God not seek it from above, nor may daylight shine on it. 5 Let darkness and deep shadow claim it; let clouds settle on it; let them terrify it with the blackness of day. 6 Let darkness seize that night; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not enter among the number of the months. 7 Look, let that night become barren; let a joyful song not enter it. 8 Let those who curse the day curse it, those who are skilled at rousing Leviathan. 9 Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light but there be none, and let it not see the eyelids of dawn 10 because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes. 11 “Why did I not die at birth? Why did I not come forth from the womb and expire? 12 Why did the knees receive me and the breasts, that I could suck?

Job,"13 For now I would lie down, and I would be at peace; I would be asleep; then I would be at rest 14 with kings and counselors of the earth, who rebuild ruins for themselves, 15 or with high officials who have gold, who fill up their houses with silver. 16 Or why was I not hidden like a miscarriage, like infants who did not see the light? 17 There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest; 18 the prisoners are at ease together; they do not hear the oppressor’s voice. 19 The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his masters. 20 “Why does he give light to one in misery and life to those bitter of soul, 21 who wait for death, but it does not come, and search for it more than for treasures, 22 who rejoice exceedingly, and they are glad when they find the grave? 23 Why does he give light to a man whose way is hidden, and God has fenced him in all around? 24 For my sighing comes before my bread, and my groanings gush forth like water 25 because the dread that I feel has come upon me, and what I feared befalls me. 26 I am not at ease, and I am not at peace, and I do not have rest, thus turmoil has come.” ",Job 3:13-26,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/job-313-26-343427/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-06-05_job-313-26_20130512211104.mp3
Job,"1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 2 “If someone would test a word with you, would you be offended? But who can refrain from speaking? 3 Look, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened weak hands. 4 Your words have raised up the one who stumbles, and you have strengthened knees giving way. 5 But now it has come to you, and you are worn out; it touches you, and you are horrified. 6 Is not your fear in God your confidence? Is not your hope even the integrity of your ways? 7 “Think now, who has perished who is innocent? Or where are the upright destroyed? 8 Just as I have seen, plowers of mischief and sowers of trouble will reap it. 9 By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they come to an end. 10 The roar of the lion and the voice of a lion in its prime, and the teeth of the young lions are broken. 11 The lion is perishing without prey, and the lion’s whelps are scattered. 12 “And a word came stealing to me, and my ear received the whisper from it. 13 Amid troubling thoughts from night visions, at the falling of deep sleep on men, 14 dread met me, and trembling, and it made many of my bones shake. 15 And a spirit glided before my face; the hair of my flesh bristled. 16 It stood still, but I could not recognize its appearance; a form was before my eyes; there was a hush, and I heard a voice: 17 ‘Can a human being be more righteous than God, or can a man be more pure than his Maker? 18 Look, he does not trust in his servants and he charges his angels with error. 19 How much more dwellers in clay houses, whose foundation is in the dust? They are crushed like a moth. 20 Between morning and evening they are destroyed; without anyone regarding it they perish forever. 21 Is not their tent cord pulled up within them? They die, but not in wisdom.’ 1 “Call now, is there anyone answering you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn? 2 For vexation will slay the fool, and jealousy will kill the simple. 3 I have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling. 4 His children are far from deliverance, and they are crushed in the gate, and there is no deliverer— 5 whose harvest the hungry eats, and he takes it from behind the thorns; and the thirsty pants after their wealth. 6 Indeed, mischief does not come from the dust, and trouble does not sprout from the earth. 7 But a human being is born to trouble, and they soar aloft like sparks.

Job,"7 But a human being is born to trouble, and they soar aloft like sparks. 8 “But I myself will seek God, and to God I would commit my cause. 9 He is doing great and unsearchable things, marvelous things without number— 10 the one who is giving rain on the surface of the earth and is sending water on the surface of the fields, 11 to set the lowly on high, and those mourning are lifted to safety. 12 He is frustrating the devices of the crafty, and their hands do not achieve success. 13 He is capturing the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are rushed. 14 In the daytime they meet with darkness, and they grope at noon as in the night. 15 And he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the poor from the hand of the strong. 16 So there is hope for the powerless, and wickedness shuts its mouth. 17 “Look, happy is the human being whom God reproves; and you must not despise the discipline of Shaddai, 18 for he himself wounds, but he binds up; he strikes, but his hands heal. 19 From six troubles he will deliver you, and in seven evil shall not touch you. 20 In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword. 21 From the scourge of the tongue you shall be hidden, and you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes. 22 At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and you shall not fear the wild animals of the earth. 23 For your covenant will be with the stones of the field, and the wild animals of the field will be at peace with you. 24 And you shall know that your tent is safe, and you will inspect your fold, and you shall not be missing anything. 25 And you shall know that your offspring are many, and your descendants like the vegetation of the earth. 26 You shall come in maturity to the grave, as the raising up of a stack of sheaves in its season. 27 “Look, we have searched this out—it is true; hear it and know it yourself.” 1 Then Job answered and said, 2 “If only my vexation could be well weighed, and my calamity could be lifted up together with it in the balances, 3 for then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; therefore my words have been rash, 4 for the arrows of Shaddai are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me. 5 Does the wild ass bray over grass, or the ox bellow over its fodder? 6 Can tasteless food be eaten without salt, or is there taste in the white of a marshmallow plant? 7 I refused to touch them; they are like food that will make me ill. 8 “O that my request may come, and that God may grant my hope, 9 that God would decide that he would crush me, that he would let loose his hand and kill me. 10 But it will still be my consolation, and I would recoil in unrelenting pain, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One. 11 What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should hold out? 12 Or is my strength like the strength of stones? Or is my flesh bronze? 13 Indeed, my help is not in me, and any success is driven from me. 14 “Loyal love should come for the afflicted from his friend, even if he forsakes the fear of Shaddai. 15 My companions are treacherous like a torrent-bed; like a streambed of wadis they flow away, ",Job 5:7-6:15,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/job-57615-343429/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-06-07_job-57615_20130512211304.mp3
Job,"15 My companions are treacherous like a torrent-bed; like a streambed of wadis they flow away, 16 which are growing dark because of ice upon them, it will pile up snow. 17 In time they dry up, they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place. 18 The paths of their way wind around; they go up into the wasteland, and they perish. 19 The caravans of Tema looked; the traveling merchants of Sheba hope for them. 20 They are disappointed, because they trusted; they came here and they are confounded. 21 “For now you have become such; you see terrors, and you fear. 22 Is it because I have said, ‘Give to me,’ or, ‘Offer a bribe for me from your wealth’? 23 or, ‘Save me from the foe’s hand,’ or, ‘Ransom me from the tyrants’ hand’? 24 Teach me, and I myself will be silent; and make me understand how I have gone astray. 25 How painful are upright words! But what does your reproof reprove? 26 Do you intend to reprove my words and consider the words of a desperate man as wind? 27 Even over the orphan you would cast the lot, and you would bargain over your friend. 28 “Therefore be prepared, turn to me, and I surely will not lie to your face. 29 Please turn, let no injustice happen; indeed, turn, my righteousness is still intact. 30 Is there injustice on my tongue? Or can my palate not discern calamity? 1 “Does not a human being have hard service on earth? And are not his days like the days of a laborer? 2 Like a slave he longs for the shadow, and like a laborer he waits for his wages. 3 So I had to inherit months of worthlessness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me. 4 When I lie down, I say, ‘When shall I rise?’ But the night is long, and I have my fill of tossing until dawn. 5 My body is clothed with maggots and clods of dust; my skin hardens, then it gives way again. 6 “My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and they come to an end without hope. 7 Remember that my life is a breath; my eye will not return to see good. 8 The eye of the one seeing me will not see me; your eyes are upon me, but I will be gone. 9 A cloud vanishes, and it goes away, so he who goes down to Sheol will not come up. 10 He does not return again to his house, and his place does not recognize him again. 11 “Even I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in my spirit’s anguish; I will complain in my inner self’s bitterness. 12 Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you set a guard over me? 13 When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me, and my couch will ease my complaint,’ 14 then you terrify me with dreams, and with visions you terrify me. 15 So my inner self will choose strangling— death more than my existence. 16 I loathe my life; I would not live forever; depart from me, for my days are a breath. 17 “What is a human being that you make him great and that you fix your mind on him, 18 so that you visit him every morning, you test him every moment? 19 How long will you not turn away from me? Or not leave me alone until I swallow my spit? 20 If I have sinned, what have I done to you, watcher of humanity? Why have you made me as a target for yourself, so that I have become a burden to myself? 21 And why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my guilt? For now I shall lie in the dust, and you will seek me, but I will be no more.” 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said, 2 “How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a mighty wind? 3 Does God pervert justice, or Shaddai pervert righteousness? 4 If your children sinned against him, then he sent them into the power of their transgression. 5 If you yourself would seek God, then you would plead to Shaddai for grace. 6 If you are pure and upright, indeed, now he will rouse himself for you, and he will restore your righteous abode. 7 Though your beginning was small, your end will be very great. 8 “Indeed, please inquire of former generations, and consider what their ancestors have found, 9 for we are of yesterday, and we do not know, for our days on earth are a shadow. 10 Will they themselves not teach you and tell you and utter words from their heart? 11 Can papyrus grow tall where there is not a marsh? Will reeds flourish without water? 12 While it is in its flower and is not plucked, yet it withers before all grass. 13 So are the paths of all who forget God; and the hope of the godless will perish, 14 whose confidence is cut off and whose trust is a spider’s house. 15 He will lean himself against his house, but it will not stand; he will take hold of it, but it will not endure. 16 He is thriving before the sun, and his plant shoots spread over his garden. 17 His roots twine over a stone heap; he sees a house of stone. 18 If he destroys him from his place, then it deceives him, saying, ‘I have never seen you.’ 19 Look, this is the joy of his way, and from dust others will spring up. 20 “Look, God will not reject the blameless, and he will not uphold the hand of evildoers. 21 Yet he will fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with a shout of joy. 22 Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more.” ",Job 6:15-8:22,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/job-615822-343430/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-06-10_job-615822_20130512211306.mp3
Job,"1 Then Job answered and said, 2 “Truly I know that it is so, but how can a human being be just before God? 3 If he wants to contend with him, he cannot answer him one time in a thousand. 4 He is wise in heart and mighty in strength; who has resisted him and succeeded? 5 “He is the one who moves mountains, and they do not know how, who overturns them in his anger. 6 He is the one who shakes the earth from its place, and its pillars tremble. 7 He is the one who commands the sun, and it does not rise, and he seals up the stars. 8 He is the one who alone stretches out the heavens and who tramples on the waves of the sea. 9 He is the one who made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south. 10 He is the one who does great things beyond understanding and marvelous things beyond number. 11 “If he passes by me, I would not see him; and if he should move on, I would not recognize him. 12 If he would snatch away, who could turn him? Who could say to him, ‘What are you doing?’ 13 God will not turn back his anger; beneath him the helpers of Rahab bow. 14 How much less can I myself answer him? How can I choose my words with him, 15 whom I cannot answer, even though I am righteous? From my judge I must implore grace. 16 If I summon him, and he should answer me, I do not believe that he will listen to my voice— 17 who crushes me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause. 18 He will not allow me to catch my breath; rather, he will fill me with bitterness. 19 If it is a matter of strength, look, he is mighty. But if it is a matter of justice, who can summon me? 20 Even though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me; even though I am blameless, yet it would pronounce me guilty. 21 “I am blameless; I do not care about myself; I loathe my life. 22 It is all one; therefore I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’ 23 When the whip kills suddenly, he mocks at the despair of the innocent. 24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the face of its judge— if it is not he, then who is it? 25 “And my days are swifter than a runner; they flee away; they do not see good. 26 They go by like papyrus skiffs, like an eagle swoops down on its prey. 27 Though I say, ‘I will forget my complaint; I will change my expression, and I will rejoice,’ 28 I become afraid of all my sufferings; I know that you do not consider me innocent. 29 If I shall be declared guilty, why then should I labor in vain? 30 If I wash myself with soap, and I cleanse my hands with lye, 31 then you plunge me into the slime pit, and my clothes abhor me. 32 “For he is not a mortal like me that I can answer him, that we can come to trial together. 33 There is no arbiter between us that he might lay his hand on both of us. 34 May he remove his rod from me, and let his dread not terrify me; 35 then I would speak and not fear him, for in myself I am not fearful. 1 “My inner self loathes my life; I want to give vent to my complaint; I want to speak out of the bitterness of my inner self. 2 I will say to God, ‘You should not condemn me; let me know why you contend against me. 3 Is it good for you that you oppress, that you despise the labor of your hands, and you smile over the schemes of the wicked? 4 Do you have eyes of flesh? Or do you see as human beings see? 5 Are your days as the days of human beings, or your years as the days of man, 6 that you seek out my iniquity, and you search for my sin 7 because of your knowledge that I am not guilty, and there is no escaping from your hand? 8 Your hands fashioned me and made me altogether, then you destroyed me. 9 Please remember that you made me like clay, but you turn me into dust again? 10 Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese? 11 You clothed me with skin and flesh, and you knit me together with bones and sinews. 12 You have granted me life and loyal love, and your care has preserved my spirit. 13 “ ‘Yet you hid these things in your heart; I know that this was your purpose. 14 If I had sinned, then you would be watching me, and you would not acquit me of my guilt. 15 If I am guilty, woe to me! But if I am righteous, I dare not lift my head; I am filled with shame, and just look at my misery! 16 And if my head grows bold, you would hunt me as the lion in its prime; and you repeat your exploits against me. 17 You renew your witnesses against me, and you increase your vexation against me; relief forces are against me. 18 So why did you bring me forth from the womb? I should have passed away, and no eye should have seen me. 19 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been brought from the womb to the grave. 20 Are not my days few? Let him leave me alone; let him turn from me, and let me rejoice a little. 21 Before I go—and I will not return— to the land of darkness and deep shadow, 22 to the land of darkness, like the darkness of a deep shadow and chaos, so that it shines forth like darkness.’ ” ","Job 9, 10",http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/job-9-10-343431/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-06-11_job-9-10_20130512211456.mp3
Job,"1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said, 2 “How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and afterward we shall speak. 3 Why are we considered as animals? Why are we taken as stupid in your eyes? 4 “You who are tearing yourself in your anger, will the earth be forsaken because of you? Or will the rock be removed from its place? 5 Furthermore, the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of his fire will not shine. 6 The light becomes dark in his tent, and his lamp above him is put out. 7 “His strong steps are shortened, and his own schemes throw him down, 8 for he is thrust into a net by his feet, and he walks into a pitfall. 9 A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare takes hold of him. 10 His rope is hidden in the ground, and his trap on the path. 11 “Sudden terrors terrify him all around, and they chase him at his heels. 12 His wealth will become hunger, and disaster is ready for his stumbling. 13 It consumes parts of his skin; the firstborn of death consumes his limbs. 14 He is torn from his tent in which he trusted, and it brought him to the king of terrors. 15 “Nothing remains for him in his tent; sulfur is scattered upon his dwelling place. 16 His roots dry up below, and its branches wither away above. 17 His remembrance perishes from the earth, and there is not a name for him on the street. 18 “They thrust him from light into darkness, and they drive him out from the world. 19 There is no offspring for him nor a descendant among his people, and there is not a survivor in his abode. 20 Those of the west are appalled over his fate, and those of the east are seized with horror. 21 Surely these are the dwellings of the godless, and this is the dwelling place of him who knows not God.” 1 Then Job answered and said, 2 “How long will you torment me and crush me with words? 3 These ten times you have disgraced me; you are not ashamed that you have attacked me. 4 And what is more, if I have truly erred, my error remains with me. 5 If indeed you must magnify yourselves against me, and you must let my disgrace argue against me, 6 know then that God has wronged me and has surrounded me with his net. 7 “Look, I cry out, ‘Violence!’ but I am not answered; I cry out, but there is no justice. 8 He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass; and he has set darkness upon my paths. 9 He has taken my glory from me, and he has removed the crown of my head. 10 He has broken me down all around, and I am gone. And he has uprooted my hope like a tree, 11 and he has kindled his wrath against me, and he has counted me as one of his foes. 12 His troops have come together and have thrown up their rampart against me and have encamped around my tent. 13 “He has removed my kinsfolk from me, and my acquaintances have only turned aside from me. 14 My relatives have failed, and my close friends have forgotten me. 15 The sojourners in my house and my slave women count me as a stranger; I have become a foreigner in their eyes. 16 I call to my servant, but he does not answer; I must personally plead with him. 17 My breath is repulsive to my wife, and I am loathsome to my own family. 18 Little boys also despise me; when I rise, then they talk against me. 19 All my intimate friends abhor me, and these whom I have loved have turned against me. 20 My bones cling to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. 21 “Pity me, pity me, you my friends, for God’s hand has touched me. 22 Why do you pursue me like God? And are not satisfied with my flesh? 23 “O that my words could be written down! O that they could be inscribed in a scroll! 24 That with a pen of iron and with lead they might be engraved on a rock forever! 25 But I myself know that my redeemer is alive, and at the last he will stand up upon the earth. 26 And after my skin has been thus destroyed, but from my flesh I will see God, 27 whom I will see for myself, and whom my eyes will see and not a stranger. My heart faints within me. 28 “If you say, ‘How will we persecute him?’ And ‘The root of the trouble is found’ in me, 29 be afraid for yourselves because of the sword, for wrath brings punishment by the sword, so that you may know that there is judgment.” 1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said, 2 “Therefore my disquieting thoughts bring me back for the sake of my inward excitement. 3 I hear discipline that insults me, and a spirit beyond my understanding answers me.

Job,"1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 2 “Can a man be of use to God? Yes, can the wise be of use to him? 3 Is it a pleasure to Shaddai if you are righteous, or a gain if you make your ways blameless? 4 Does he reprove you because of your reverence or enter into judgment with you? 5 Is not your wickedness great, and there is no end to your iniquities? 6 “Indeed, you have required a pledge from your family for nothing, and you have stripped off the clothes of the naked. 7 You have given no water for the weary to drink, and you withheld food from the hungry. 8 And the land belongs to the man of power, and the favored lives in it. 9 You have sent widows away empty-handed, and the arms of orphans were crushed. 10 Therefore trapping nets are all around you, and panic suddenly terrifies you, 11 or it is so dark you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you. 12 “Is not God in the height of the heavens? But see how lofty are the highest stars. 13 And you ask, ‘What does God know? Can he judge through deep gloom? 14 Thick clouds are a covering for him, so that he does not see; and he walks about on the dome of heaven.’ 15 Will you keep to the way of old that the people of mischief have trod, 16 who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was washed away by a current? 17 Those who said to God, ‘Turn away from us,’ and ‘What can Shaddai do to us?’ 18 Yet he himself filled up their houses with good things, but the schemes of the wicked are repugnant to me. 19 The righteous see, and they rejoice, but the innocent one mocks at them. 20 Surely our foe perishes, and fire has consumed their remainder. 21 “Please reconcile yourself with him, and be at peace; in this way, good will come to you. 22 Please receive instruction from his mouth, and place his words in your heart. 23 If you return to Shaddai, you will be restored; if you remove wickedness from your tent, 24 and if you put gold ore in the dust, and the gold of Ophir in the rock of wadis, 25 then Shaddai will be your gold ore and your precious silver. 26 Indeed, then you will delight yourself in Shaddai, and you will expect that God will be good to you. 27 You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows. 28 And you will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways. 29 When they are humiliated, you say, ‘It is pride,’ for he saves the humble. 30 He will deliver the guilty, and he will escape because of the cleanness of your hands.” 1 Then Job answered and said, 2 “Even today my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy in addition to my groaning. 3 O that I knew and that I might find him; O that I might come to his dwelling. 4 I would lay my case before him, and I would fill my mouth with arguments. 5 I want to know the words with which he would answer me, and I want to understand what he would say to me. 6 Would he contend with me in the greatness of his strength? No, but he himself would give heed to me. 7 There an upright person could reason with him, and I would be acquitted forever by my judge. 8 “When I go forward, he is not there, or backward, I cannot see him. 9 When he works on the left, I cannot perceive him; he turns to the right, but I cannot see him. 10 But he knows the way that I take; he tests me—I shall come out like gold. 11 My foot has held on to his steps; I have kept his way, and I have not turned aside. 12 From the commandment of his lips, indeed I have not departed; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily food. 13 “But he is alone, and who can dissuade him? And whatever he desires, indeed, he does it. 14 For he will carry out what he appoints for me, and many things like these are with him. 15 Therefore, I am horrified because of his presence; when I consider, I tremble because of him. 16 Indeed, God has made my heart faint, and Shaddai has terrified me. 17 Indeed, I have not been silenced because of darkness, and because of me he conceals thick darkness.

Job,"1 Then Job again took up his discourse and said, 2 “O that I were as in the months before, as in the days when God watched over me, 3 when his shining lamp was over my head— by his light I walked through darkness— 4 as when I was in the days of my prime, when God’s confiding was over my house, 5 when Shaddaiwas still with me, my children were all around me, 6 when my paths were washed in sour milk, and the rock poured out streams of oil for me. 7 “At my going out the gate to the city, I secured my seat in the square. 8 Young men saw me and stepped aside, and the aged rose up and stood. 9 Officials refrained from talking, and they laid their hand on their mouth. 10 The voices of nobles were hushed, and their tongue stuck to their palate. 11 “When the ear heard and commended me, and the eye saw and testified in support of me 12 because I saved the needy who cried for help, and I saved the orphan for whom there was no helper. 13 The blessing of the wretched came upon me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy. 14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a headband. 15 “I was eyes to the blind, and I was feet to the lame. 16 I was a father to the poor, and I investigated the stranger’s legal dispute. 17 And I broke the evil one’s jaw bones, and I made his prey drop from his teeth. 18 “And I thought, ‘I will pass away in my nest, and like the phoenix I shall multiply my days. 19 My roots were open to water, and dew spent the night on my branches; 20 My glory was new with me, and I was revitalized regularly.’ 21 “They listened to me and waited, and they kept silent for my counsel. 22 After my word, they did not speak again, and my word dropped down like dew upon them. 23 And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain. 24 I smiled for them when they had no confidence in anything, and they did not extinguish the light of my face. 25 I chose their way, and I sat as head, and I dwelled like a king among the troops, like one who comforts mourners. 1 “But now those younger than I, as far as days, laugh at me, whose fathers I rejected for setting with the dogs of my sheep and goats. 2 Moreover, what use to me is the strength of their hands? With them, vigor is destroyed. 3 Through want and through barren hunger they are gnawing in the dry region in the darkness of desolation and waste. 4 They are picking salt herbs, the leaves of bushes, and the roots of broom trees to warm themselves. 5 They were driven out from fellow people; they shout at them as at a thief, 6 so that they dwell in holes of the ground and in the rocks. 7 They bray among the bushes; they are gathered under the nettles. 8 A senseless crowd, yes, a disreputable brood, they were cast out from the land. 9 “But now I am their mocking song, and I have become a byword for them. 10 They abhor me; they keep aloof from me, and they do not withhold spit from my face 11 because he has loosened his bowstring and humbled me, and they have thrown off restraint in my presence. 12 On the right hand the brood rises up; they put me to flight, and they build up their siege ramps against me. 13 They destroy my path; they promote my destruction; they have no helper. 14 As through a wide breach they come; amid a crash they rush on. 15 Terrors are turned upon me; my honor is pursued as by the wind, and my hope of deliverance passed by like a cloud. 16 “And now my life is poured out onto me; days of misery have taken hold of me. 17 At night I am in great pain; my pains do not take a rest. 18 He seizes my clothing with great power; he grasps me by my tunic’s collar. 19 He has cast me into the dirt, and I have become like dust and ashes. 20 I cry to you for help, but you do not answer me; I stand, and you merely look at me. 21 You have turned cruel to me; you persecute me with your hand’s might. 22 You lift me up to the wind—you make me ride it, and you toss me about in the storm. 23 Indeed, I know that you will bring me to death and to the house of assembly for all the living. 24 “Surely someone must not send a hand against the needy when, in his misfortune, there is a cry of help for them. 25 Have I not wept for the unfortunate, and grieved myself over the poor? 26 Indeed, I hoped for good, but evil came, and I waited for light, but darkness came. 27 My bowels are in turmoil, and they are not still; days of misery come to confront me. 28 I go about in mourning garb, but not in sunlight; I stand up in the assembly, and I cry for help. 29 I am a companion for the jackals and a companion for ostriches. 30 My skin turns black on me, and my bones burn with heat. 31 So my lyre came to be used for mourning, and my flute for the voice of those who weep.

Job,"1 Thus Elihu spoke up and said, 2 “Hear my words, you wise men, and listen to me, you who know, 3 for the ear tests words, and the palate tastes food. 4 Let us choose justice for ourselves; let us determine among ourselves what is good— 5 for Job has said, ‘I am righteous, but God has taken away my justice. 6 Should I lie concerning my justice? Though I am without transgression, my wound caused by an arrow is incurable.’ 7 What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water? 8 And he goes on the road in company with instigators of mischief, and walks with men of wickedness. 9 Indeed, he says, ‘A man does not profit when he takes delight in God.’ 10 “Therefore, listen to me, people who have sense: far be it from God that he should commit wickedness and that Shaddai should do wrong. 11 Indeed, he will repay according to a human being’s deeds, and according to a man’s way he will let it happen to him. 12 What’s more, God truly does not act wickedly, and Shaddai does not pervert justice. 13 Who gave him charge over the earth? Or who laid on him the whole world? 14 If he should set his heart to it, and he should gather his spirit and his breath to himself, 15 all flesh would perish together, and humankind would return to dust. 16 “But if you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say. 17 Shall he who hates justice really govern? Or will you declare the Righteous One, the Mighty, guilty?— 18 the one who says to a king, ‘You worthless man,’ to noblemen, ‘You wicked man,’ 19 who shows no partiality to officials and who does not take note of the noble more than of the insignificant, for all of them are the work of his hands? 20 In a moment they die, and in the middle of the night the people are shaken, and they pass away, and they take away the mighty effortlessly. 21 “Indeed, his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he sees all his steps. 22 There is no darkness, and there is no deep shadow where instigators of mischief might hide themselves. 23 Indeed, he has not yet appointed a time for man to go to God in the judgment. 24 He shatters the mighty without investigation, and he sets others in their place. 25 Therefore he knows their works, and he overturns them in the night so that they are crushed. 26 He strikes them where the wicked stood, where there are onlookers, 27 because they have turned aside from him and have not understood any of his ways, 28 so that they cause the cry of distress from the helpless to come to him, and he hears the cry of distress from the needy, 29 but he remains quiet, and who can condemn? And he hides his face, and who can behold him? Yet he is over a nation and over a person alike, 30 so that godless human beings should not reign, nor those who ensnare the people. 31 “Indeed, does anyone say to God, ‘I have endured chastisement; I will not act corruptly again; 32 teach me yourself what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not repeat it’? 33 According to your judgment, must he repay it because you rejected this? Indeed, you must choose, and not I, so declare what you know. 34 Those who have sense say to me, and the wise man hearing me says: 35 ‘Job speaks without knowledge, and his words are without insight. 36 Would that Job were tested up to the end because his answers are like those from men of mischief, 37 for he adds transgression to his sin; he claps hands among us, and he multiplies his words against God.’ ” 1 Moreover, Elihu spoke up and said, 2 “Do you think this is justice when you say, ‘I am right before God’? 3 If you ask what it profits you: ‘How do I benefit by refraining from my sin?’ 4 I myself will give answer to you and to your friends with you. 5 “Look at the heavens, and see; and observe the clouds that are higher than you. 6 If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him? 7 If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand? 8 Your wickedness affects a person like yourself, and your righteousness affects humans. 9 “Because of the multitude of oppressions, they cry out; they cry for help because of the arm of the mighty. 10 But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night, 11 who teaches us more than the animals of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’ 12 There they cry out, but he does not answer because of the pride of evildoers. 13 “Surely God does not hear an empty plea, and Shaddai does not regard it. 14 How much less when you say that you do not see him, that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him! 15 But now, because his anger does not punish, and he does not acknowledge the transgression at all, 16 therefore Job opens his mouth in empty talk— without knowledge he multiplies words.” ","Job 34, 35",http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/job-34-35-344978/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-06-28_job-34-35_20130522161914.mp3
Esther,"1 In the twelfth month, that is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day, on which the edict of the king arrived and his law was enacted, on the day in which the enemies of the Jews had hoped to gain power over them but was overturned, and the Jews gained power against their enemies, 2 the Jews gathered in their cities in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike against those who sought their destruction, and no one could withstand them, as the fear of them fell on all the people. 3 All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, governors, and those who did the work of the king were supporting the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them. 4 For Mordecai was high-ranking in the king’s palace and his fame spread throughout all the provinces as Mordecai grew more and more powerful. 5 The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them; and they did as they pleased with those that hated them. 6 And in the citadel of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men,7 and Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 8 Portha, Adalia, Aridatha, 9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 10 the ten sons of Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews; but they did not touch the plunder. 11 On that day the number of those being killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king. 12 And the king said to Queen Esther, “In the citadel of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? What is your petition? It will be granted to you. And what further is your request? It will be done.” 13 Esther replied, “If it is good to the king, let tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do according to the edict of today; and let them hang Haman’s ten sons on the gallows.” 14 And the king said to do so. And a decree was issued in Susa and Haman’s ten sons were hanged. 15 And the Jews were gathered who were in Susa, and on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they killed in Susa three hundred men, but they did not touch the plunder. 16 The rest of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered and defended their lives and found repose from their enemies. And they killed seventy-five thousand of those that hated them, but they did not touch the plunder. 17 This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. They rested on the fourteenth day and made it a day of feasting and joy. 18 But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day, and rested on the fifteenth day. And they made it a day of feasting and joy. 19 Therefore the Jews in the rural areas, living in the rural towns, made the fourteenth month of Adar a day of joy and feasting, a festive day of giving gifts to each other. 20 Mordecai wrote down these things and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all of the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, 21 to impose on them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and the fifteenth day, every year, 22 as the day that the Jews found relief from their enemies, and the month which changed for them from sorrow to joy, and from a mourning ceremony to a festive day; to make them days of feasting and joy, and giving gifts to each other and to the poor. 23 And the Jews adopted what they had begun to do and what Mordecai had written to them. 24 For Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and he had cast pur, that is the lot, to rout them out and destroy them. 25 But when it came to the attention of the king, he gave orders in writing that his evil plot that he had devised against the Jews should return on his head, and they hung him and his sons on the gallows. 26 Therefore they called these days Purim, because of the name Pur. Thus because of all the words of this letter, and of what they faced concerning this, and of what had happened to them, 27 the Jews established and adopted it for themselves and for their offspring, and for all who joined them. They did not neglect to observe these two days every year as it was written and appointed to them. 28 These days are to be remembered and are to be kept in every generation, and in family, province, and city; and these days of Purim are not to be neglected among the Jews, and their memory shall not come to an end among their offspring. 29 So Queen Esther the daughter of Abihail and Mordecai the Jew wrote in full authority to confirm this second letter of Purim. 30 He sent letters of words of peace and truth to all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of Ahasuerus’ kingdom, 31 to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had imposed, and just as they had imposed on themselves and their offspring regulations of the fast and their lament. 32 And the command of Esther established these practices of Purim, and it was written on the scroll. 1 King Ahasuerus imposed forced labor on the land and islands of the sea. 2 All the work of his authority and his powerful deeds, and the full accounting of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written on the scroll of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? 3 For Mordecai the Jew was second-in-command to King Ahasuerus. He was great for the Jews and popular with many of his brothers, for he sought good for his people, interceding for the welfare of all his descendants.

Nehemiah,"1 The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah. It happened in the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year, that I myself was in the citadel in Susa, 2 and one of my brothers, Hanani, came with some men from Judah. I asked them about the Jews who had escaped the captivity and about Jerusalem. 3 They replied to me, “The survivors in the province who have survived the captivity are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned in the fire.” 4 When I heard these words, I sat and wept and mourned for days, and I was fasting and praying before the God of the heavens. 5 I said, “O Yahweh God of the heavens, the great and awesome one who keeps the covenant and loyal love for the ones who love him and for those who keep his commands. 6 Please, let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer of your servant that I am praying before you by day and by night for your servants, the Israelites, and confessing the sins of the Israelites that we have sinned against you.

Nehemiah,"7 We have certainly offended you and have not kept the commands, regulations, and judgments that you have commanded your servant Moses. 8 Please, remember the word that you have commanded to your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you act unfaithfully I will scatter you all among the nations. 9 But if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, even though all of your outcasts are at the furthest parts of heaven, I will gather them and bring them to the place which I have chosen to make my name dwell.’ 10 They are your servants and your people whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand. 11 O Lord, please let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight to revere in your name. Please, let your servant be successful this day and give him compassion before this man.” I was cupbearer for the king. 1 It happened in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, I carried the wine and gave it to the king. And I had never been sad before the king. 2 So the king said to me, “Why is your face sad since you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of the heart.” And I was very much afraid. 3 I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad when the city of my ancestors’ burial site is ruined and her gates are consumed by fire?” 4 Then the king said to me, “What is your request?” So I prayed to the God of the heavens. 5 Then I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your presence, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors’ burial sites, so that I may rebuild it.” 6 With the queen sitting beside him, the king said to me, “How long will your journey be and when will you return?” So it pleased the king and he sent me, and I set for him an appointed time. 7 Then I said to the king, “If it is good for the king, let letters be given to me for the governors in the province Beyond the River, that they may let me pass until I come to Judah. 8 Also, a letter to Asaph, keeper of the king’s land reserve, that he should give me timber for laying the beams for the gates of the citadel of the house and for the walls of the city, and for the house which I will enter.” And the king gave permission to me, according to the good hand of God on me. 9 I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and I gave them the letters of the king. Then the king sent troop commanders and horses with me. 10 But when Sanballat the Horonite and the Ammonite servant Tobiah heard this, they were greatly displeased that a person had come to seek the welfare of the Israelites. 11 I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days. 12 I got up during the night, I and a few men with me. I did not tell anybody what my God put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. No animal was with me except the animal that I was riding on. 13 I went out during the night at the gate of the valley by the Dragon spring and to the Dung Gate. And I examined the walls in Jerusalem and its gates that had been destroyed by the fire. 14 I crossed over to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there was no place for my mount to cross over. 15 So I went up by the valley during the night and was examining the wall. Then I returned and came to the Valley Gate and returned. 16 The prefects did not know where I had gone and what I was doing. I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the prefects, and the rest of the workers.

Come, build the walls of Jerusalem and we shall no longer be a disgrace.” 18 I told them of the good hand of my God that was upon me and surely the words of the king that were spoken to me. And they said, “Let us arise and build!” And they strengthened their hands for this good work. 19 But Sanballat the Horonite, the Ammonite servant Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard it, and they mocked and despised us, saying, “What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?” 20 Then I answered and said to them, “The God of the heavens himself will let us succeed, and we his servants shall arise and build. But for you there is no share, right, or memorial in Jerusalem.” 1 Then Eliashib the high priest and his brothers the priests arose and rebuilt the Sheep Gate.

Nehemiah,"1 Now it happened when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he became angry and greatly provoked, and he mocked the Jews. 2 Then he said before his brothers and the army of Samaria, “What are the feeble Jews doing? Will they restore these things for themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the piles of rubble—even those burned up?” 3 Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him and said, “Their wall of stone that they are building would break down if a fox went on it!” 4 Hear, our God, for we are despised. Turn their scorn on their head and give them over to plunder in the land of captivity. 5 Do not cover their guilt, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before you. They have provoked the builders to anger. 6 So we rebuilt the wall, and all of the wall was joined up to half its height. For the people had a heart to do it. 7 Now when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the restoration of the walls of Jerusalem were going forward and the gaps were being closed, they were very angry. 8 So all of them plotted together to come fight against Jerusalem and to make trouble for it. 9 So we prayed to our God and set up a guard against them day and night. 10 But Judah said, “The strength of the carriers is failing, and there is too much dirt, and we are not able to build at the wall.” 11 Then our enemies said, “They will not know nor see until we come upon them and will kill them and stop the work.” 12 When the Jews who lived beside them came, they said to us ten times, “From all of the places where they live, they will come up against us.” 13 I stationed the people behind the deepest part of the wall in the open places according to their families, with their swords, spears, and bows. 14 And I looked, got up, and said to the nobles, prefects, and the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.” 15 It happened when our enemies heard that their plan was known to us, that God had frustrated it, and we all returned to the wall—each to his work. 16 From that day, half of my servants were working on craftsmanship, half were holding spears, small shields, bows, and breastplates. The commanders were behind the whole house of Judah. 17 The ones who were building the wall and the ones who carried the materials were carrying in one hand while doing the task, and with the other hand were grasping a weapon. 18 Each of the builders had his sword tied to his side while building. And the man who sounded the trumpet was beside me. 19 I said to the nobles, to the prefects, and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and widespread, and we are spread out over the wall far from each other. 20 Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, come together to us there. Our God will fight for us.” 21 So we labored at the work, and half of them were holding the spears from dawn until the stars came out. 22 At the time I also said to the people, “Let each man and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they will be a guard for us in the night and work in the day.” 23 So neither I nor my brothers nor my young men nor the men of the guard who were behind me took off our clothes. Each one kept his weapon even in the water.

Nehemiah,"1 Now there was a great cry of distress of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers. 2 There were those who were saying, “Our sons and daughters, we are many. We must get grain so that we may eat and live.” 3 There were also those saying, “We have pledged our fields and our vineyards and our houses so that we can get grain in the famine.” 4 And there were those who were saying, “We have borrowed money on our fields and our vineyards for the tax of the king. 5 Now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our sons are like their sons. Look, we are subduing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and there are some from our daughters being molested. We are powerless, and our fields and vineyards belong to others.” 6 I was very angry when I heard their shouts and these words. 7 I thought over this in my heart, and then I quarreled with the nobles and the prefects. I said to them, “You yourselves are taking interest from your own brother!” So I called the great assembly against them, 8 and I said to them: “We ourselves have bought back our brothers the Jews who were sold to the nations as we were able. But now you yourselves have sold your brothers so they may be sold to us!” They were silent and could not find a word to say. 9 So I said, “The thing that you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God to prevent the disgrace from the nations, our enemies? 10 Also, I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please stop taking this interest. 11 Please restore to them this day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, their houses, and the interest on the money, the grain, the grape juice, and the olive oil that you have been taking from them.” 12 So they said, “We will restore it and will not request anything more. So we will do as you say.” Then I called the priests and made them take an oath to do this promise. 13 I also shook out my garment and said, “This is how God will shake out everyone from his house who will not keep this promise. So this is how his possessions will be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen!” And they praised Yahweh, and the people kept this promise. 14 Moreover, from the appointed day I was made their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes—twelve years. My brothers and I did not eat the food allowance of the governor. 15 The former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people, and they took food and wine from them, besides forty shekels. Also, their servants controlled the people, but I did not do so because of the fear of God. 16 I also devoted myself to the work of this wall, and we did not buy land. All of my servants were gathered for the work. 17 One hundred and fifty men, prefects and Jews, and those who came to us from the nations around us, were at my table. 18 Now what was prepared each day for me was one ox, six choice sheep, and birds. And every ten days all kinds of wine were made. But for this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor because the slavery was too heavy on this people. 19 Remember me for good, my God, all that I have done for this people.

Nehemiah,"1 Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that no gap was left in it—though up to that time I had not erected doors in the gates— 2 Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come and let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they planned to do evil to me. 3 So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I am not able to come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you all?” 4 And they sent a message to me four times like this, and I returned an answer like this to them. 5 And Sanballat sent his servant with an open letter, another word like this to me a fifth time, in his hand. 6 In it was written, “It has been reported among the nations, and Gashmu also is saying it, that you and the Jews are considering rebellion. Therefore, truly you are building the wall and you are becoming their king, according to these words. 7 You have also set up prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, saying, ‘There is a king in Judah.’ And now it will be proclaimed to the king according to these words. Now, come and we will plan together.” 8 So I sent to him saying, “None of these words you have spoken has happened. You are indeed saying things created in your own mind”— 9 for all of them sought to frighten us, saying, “their hands will not do the work.” And now, God, strengthen my hands. 10 Now I went into the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home, and he said, “Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill you—during the night they are coming to kill you.” 11 But I said, “Should a man like me run away? And would a man like me go into the temple so that he can save his life? I will not go in!” 12 Then I look and realized God had not sent him; rather, he had spoken the prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 13 For this reason he was hired: to frighten me so that I would act and sin, so that they would have a bad report so they could taunt me. 14 Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to their works, and also Noadiah the prophetess, and the remainder of the prophets who were frightening me. 15 So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days. 16 When our enemies heard of this, all of the nations surrounding us were afraid and lost their confidence. They knew that this work had been done with the help of our God. 17 Also, in those days the nobles of Judah increasingly sent their letters to Tobiah, and letters from Tobiah returned to them. 18 For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jehohanan took as a wife the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah. 19 They also were speaking of his good deeds in my presence, and they were sending my words out to him. Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.

Nehemiah,"1 Now when the wall had been built and I had erected the doors and appointed the gatekeepers, singers, and the Levites, 2 I gave command over Jerusalem to my brother Hanani and Hananiah the commander of the citadel. For he was a faithful man and feared God more than many. 3 I said to them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. While they are standing guard let them shut and fasten the doors. And appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his post and another opposite his house.” 4 The city was widespread and large, but the people in it were few and no houses were rebuilt. 5 Then my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, the prefects, and the people to be enrolled. I found the book of the genealogy of those who first came back, and I found this written upon it: 6 These are the people of the province who came up from captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried into exile. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each one to his city. 7 These came with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel: 8 the descendants of Parosh, two thousand one hundred and seventy-two. 9 The descendants of Shephatiah, three hundred and seventy-two. 10 The descendants of Arah, six hundred and fifty-two. 11 The descendants of Pahath-Moab, of the descendants of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred and eighteen. 12 The descendants of Elam, one thousand two hundred and fifty-four. 13 The descendants of Zattu, eight hundred and forty-five. 14 The descendants of Zaccai, seven hundred and sixty. 15 The descendants of Binnui, six hundred and forty-eight. 16 The descendants of Bebai, six hundred and twenty-eight. 17 The descendants of Azgad, two thousand three hundred and twenty-two. 18 The descendants of Adonikam, six hundred and sixty-seven. 19 The descendants of Bigvai, two thousand and sixty-seven. 20 The descendants of Adin, six hundred and fifty-five. 21 The descendants of Ater, namely of Hezekiah, ninety-eight. 22 The descendants of Hashum, three hundred and twenty-eight. 23 The descendants of Bezai, three hundred and twenty-four. 24 The descendants of Hariph, one hundred and twelve. 25 The descendants of Gibeon, ninety-five. 26 The men of Bethlehem and Netophah, one hundred and eighty-eight. 27 The men of Anathoth, one hundred and twenty-eight. 28 The men of Beth-azmaveth, forty-two. 29 The men of Kiriath-Jearim, Kephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty-three. 30 The men of Ramah and Geba, six hundred and twenty-one. 31 The men of Micmash, one hundred and twenty-two. 32 The men of Bethel and Ai, one hundred and twenty-three. 33 The men of the other Nebo, fifty-two. 34 The people of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred and fifty-four. 35 The people of Harim, three hundred and twenty. 36 The people of Jericho, three hundred and forty-five. 37 The people of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred and twenty-one. 38 The people of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty. 39 The priests: The descendants of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred and seventy-three. 40 The descendants of Immer, one thousand and fifty-two. 41 The descendants of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred and forty-seven. 42 The descendants of Harim, one thousand and seventeen. 43 The Levites: the descendants of Jeshua, namely of Kadmiel of the descendants of Hodaviah, seventy-four. 44 The singers: the descendants of Asaph, one hundred and forty-eight. 45 The gatekeepers: the descendants of Shallum, the descendants of Ater, the descendants of Talmon, the descendants of Akkub, the descendants of Hatita, the descendants of Shobai, one hundred and thirty-eight. 46 The temple servants: the descendants of Ziha, the descendants of Hasupha, the descendants of Tabbaoth, 47 the descendants of Keros, the descendants of Siaha, the descendants of Padon, 48 the descendants of Lebanah, the descendants of Hagaba, the descendants of Shalmai, 49 the descendants of Hanan, the descendants of Giddel, the descendants of Gahar, 50 the descendants of Reaiah, the descendants of Rezin, the descendants of Nekoda, 51 the descendants of Gazzam, the descendants of Uzza, the descendants of Paseah, 52 the descendants of Besai, the descendants of Meunim, the descendants of Nephushesim, 53 the descendants of Bakbuk, the descendants of Hakupha, the descendants of Harhur, 54 the descendants of Bazlith, the descendants of Mehida, the descendants of Harsha, 55 the descendants of Barkos, the descendants of Sisera, the descendants of Temah, 56 the descendants of Neziah, the descendants of Hatipha. 57 The descendants of Solomon’s servants: the descendants of Sotai, the descendants of Sophereth, the descendants of Perida, 58 the descendants of Jaala, the descendants of Darkon, the descendants of Giddel, 59 the descendants of Shephatiah, the descendants of Hattil, the descendants of Pochereth-Hazzebaim, the descendants of Amon. 60 All the temple servants and the descendants of Solomon’s servants were three hundred and ninety-two. 61 These were the ones who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they were not able to prove their ancestral houses or their descent, whether they were from Israel: 62 the descendants of Delaiah, the descendants of Tobiah, the descendants of Nekoda, six hundred and forty-two. 63 And from the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, the descendants of Barzillai (who had taken as a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name). 64 These sought their record among those enrolled in the genealogy, but it was not found there, so they were excluded as unclean from the priesthood. 65 So the governor said to them that they could not eat the most holy food until a priest could come with Urim and Thummim. 66 All of the assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty, 67 besides their servants and female slaves—these were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven. And the male and female singers were two hundred and forty-five, 69 there were four hundred and thirty-five camels and six thousand seven hundred and twenty male donkeys. 70 Now some from the heads of the families gave to the work. The governor gave to the storehouse one thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, and five hundred and thirty priestly tunics. 71 Now some of the heads of the families gave to the storehouse of the work twenty thousand gold darics and two thousand two hundred silver minas. 72 And what the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand silver minas, and sixty-seven priestly tunics. 73 So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel settled in their cities. When the seventh month came, the Israelites were in their cities.

Nehemiah,"1 All of the people gathered as one to the public square before the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses that Yahweh had commanded Israel. 2 So Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly for each man and woman to hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month. 3 He read from it facing the public square before the Water Gate from dawn until noon that day, opposite the men, women, and those with understanding. The ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law. 4 Then Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden podium that had been made for the occasion. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right. On his left was Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. 5 Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, because he was above all of the people. When he opened it all the people stood up. 6 Then Ezra blessed Yahweh the great God, and all of the people answered, “Amen! Amen!” while lifting their hands. Then they bowed down and worshiped Yahweh with their noses to the ground. 7 And Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites were teaching the people from the law while the people were in their places. 8 So they read the book from the law of God, making it clear and giving the meaning so that they could understand the reading. 9 Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all of the people, “This day is holy to Yahweh your God. Do not mourn nor weep.” For all of the people wept when they heard the words of the law. 10 Then he said to them, “Go, eat festive food and drink sweet drinks, and send a share to those for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our lord. Do not be grieved because the joy of Yahweh is your refuge.” 11 So the Levites silenced all of the people, saying, “Silence, for this day is holy. Do not be grieved.” 12 All of the people went to eat, to drink, to send a share, and to have great joy because they understood the words that they had made known to them. 13 On the second day the heads of the families of all the people, the priests, and the Levites gathered together to Ezra the scribe to study the words of the law. 14 They found written in the law, which Yahweh had commanded by the hand of Moses, that the Israelites should live in booths during the festival of the seventh month, 15 and that they should proclaim and give voice in all of their cities in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the hill and bring olive tree branches, olive oil wood branches, myrtle shrub branches, palm tree branches, and other leafy tree branches to make booths, as it is written.” 16 So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each on his roof, in their courtyards, in the courtyards of the house of God, in the public square of the Water Gate, and in the public square of the Gate of Ephraim. 17 And all of the assembly of those who returned from captivity made booths and lived in the booths because the Israelites had not done it from the days of Jeshua son of Nun until that day. And there was very great joy. 18 And he read from the scroll of the law of God day by day from the first day up to the last day. They celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day there was an assembly according to the rule.

Nehemiah,"1 On the twenty-fourth day of this month the Israelites gathered in fasting, in sackcloths, and with soil on them. 2 Those of the seed of Israel separated themselves from all of the foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their ancestors. 3 They stood up in their place and read from the book of the law of Yahweh their God for a fourth part of the day, and for a fourth they were confessing and worshiping Yahweh their God. 4 Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Kenani stood on the platform of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to Yahweh their God. 5 Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, “Stand up, bless Yahweh your God from everlasting until everlasting. Blessed be your glorious name that is being exalted above all blessing and praise! 6 “You alone are Yahweh. You alone have made the heavens, the heavens of the heavens, and all of their army, the earth and all that is in it, the waters and all that is in them. You give life to all of them, and the army of the heavens worship you. 7 You are Yahweh, the God who chose Abram and brought him from Ur of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham. 8 You found his heart faithful before you and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite and the Girgashite—to give it to his seed. And you have kept your word because you are righteous. 9 “You saw the misery of our ancestors in Egypt, and you heard their shout at the Red Sea. 10 You gave signs and wonders against Pharaoh, all of his servants, and all of the people of his land because you knew that they acted arrogantly against them. You made a name for yourself, as it is this day. 11 And you divided the sea before them, and they passed through the sea on dry ground, but their pursuers you threw into the depths like a stone into mighty waters. 12 You led them by day with a column of cloud and with a column of fire by night, to give them light on the way that they were to go. 13 Then you came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven and gave them right judgments and true teachings, good regulations and commandments. 14 You made known your holy Sabbath to them and gave them commandments, regulations, and law by the hand of your servant Moses. 15 You gave them bread from heaven for their starvation, and you caused water to go out from a rock for their thirst. You told them to go in order to take into possession the land that you have sworn by your hand to give to them. 16 “But they and our ancestors acted arrogantly and stiffened their neck and did not listen to your commandments. 17 They refused to listen and did not remember your wonders that you did among them. They stiffened their neck and in their rebellion determined to return to their slavery. But you are a God of forgiveness, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abundant in loyal love, so you did not abandon them. 18 Even when they made for themselves a molten idol of a calf and said, ‘This is your God who brought you out from Egypt,’ and committed great blasphemies. 19 But you in your many mercies did not abandon them in the desert. The column of cloud that was over them in the day did not cease to leave them on the way, and the column of fire by night that gave light to them on the way that they went. 20 And you gave your good Spirit to instruct them and did not withhold your manna from their mouth and gave them water for their thirst. 21 Forty years you sustained them in the desert—they were not in need. Their clothing did not wear out and their feet did not swell. 22 And you gave them kingdoms and nations and allotted them a portion. They took into possession the land of Sihon king of Heshbon and the land of Og king of Bashan. 23 You made their children numerous like the stars of the heavens and brought them to the land that you told their ancestors to enter in order to take possession. 24 So the children went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites; you gave them into their hand, and their kings and the nations of the land to do with them according to their pleasure. 25 And they captured fortified cities and a fertile land and took possession of houses filled with every good thing: hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves, and many fruit trees. They ate and became full, and they became fat and took delight in your great goodness. 26 “But they rebelled and were rebellious against you and cast your law behind their back and killed your prophets, who had warned them to turn back to you, and they did great blasphemies. 27 Therefore you gave them into the hand of their enemy, and they brought trouble to them. Then in the time of their trouble they cried out to you, and you heard from the heavens, and according to your great compassions, you gave them saviors, and you saved them from the hand of their enemies. 28 But when they had rest they returned to doing evil before you, and you abandoned them in the hand of their enemies, and they ruled over them. Then they returned and cried out to you, and from the heavens you heard and many times rescued them according to your compassions. 29 You warned them so that they would return to your law. Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to your commandments but sinned against your judgments that a person must do so that they may live. They turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not listen. 30 You were patient toward them for many years, and you have warned them by your spirit through the hand of your prophets, but they did not listen. So you gave them into the hand of the nations of the lands. 31 But in your great compassions you did not put an end to them, and you did not abandon them. For you are a gracious and compassionate God. 32 “And now our God, the great, mighty, and awesome God who keeps his covenant and loyal love, do not belittle in your presence all of the hardship that is found in us, our kings, our officials, our priests, our prophets, our ancestors, and all of our people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until this day. 33 You are righteous in everything that has come on us, for you dealt faithfully, and we have acted wickedly. 34 Our kings, our officials, our priests, and our ancestors did not keep your law and did not listen to your commandments and statutes that you declared to them. 35 And in their kingdom and in the greatness you gave to them, and in the wide and fertile land that you gave before them, they did not serve you and did not turn from their evil deeds. 36 Behold, we are slaves to this day, and the land that you have given to our ancestors to eat its fruits and enjoy its goodness—behold, we are slaves in it! 37 Its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have given over us because of our sins, and they are ruling over our dead bodies and our livestock at their pleasure. We are in great trouble. 38 “Now because of all of this we make a binding written agreement and are writing on the sealed documents the names of our commanders, our Levites, and our priests.” ",Nehemiah 9,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/nehemiah-9-329945/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-04-17_nehemiah-9_20130318133222.mp3
Nehemiah,"1 Upon the sealed documents: Nehemiah the governor, son of Hacaliah and Zedekiah; 2 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, 3 Pashhur, Amariah, Malkijah, 4 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, 5 Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah, 6 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, 7 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, 8 Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah—these are the priests. 9 And the Levites: Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui from the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel; 10 their brothers Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan, 11 Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah, 12 Zaccur, Shereiah, Shebanaih, 13 Hodiah, Bani, Beninu. 14 The heads of the people: Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, 15 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai, 16 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, 17 Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur, 18 Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai, 19 Hariph, Anathoth, Nobai, 20 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir, 21 Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua, 22 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah, 23 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub, 24 Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek, 25 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah, 26 Ahijah, Hanan, Anan, 27 Malluch, Harim, Baanah. 28 “The rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, and all who separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to observe the law of God—their wives, their sons, their daughters, and all who know and understand— 29 are helping their brothers, their nobles, and entering into a solemn oath to walk in the law of God which was given by the hand of Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all of the commandments of Yahweh our Lord and his judgments and regulations. 30 We will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land nor take their daughters for our sons. 31 And the peoples of the land who bring merchandise and any grain on the Sabbath day to sell, we will not accept it from them on the Sabbath or on a holy day. We will forego the crops of the seventh year and cancel every debt. 32 “We put on ourselves the commandment upon us to yearly give a third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God: 33 for the rows of bread, the offering of the daily sacrifice, the continual burnt sacrifice, the Sabbaths, the new moon festivals, the appointed festival times, the holy objects, the sin offerings that make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God. 34 And we have cast lots for the contributions of the wood offering of the priests, the Levites, and the people to bring it to the house of our God, by our fathers’ houses, at designated times, year by year, to burn on the altar of Yahweh our God—as it is written in the law. 35 We also bring the first fruits of our soil and the first fruits of all the fruit trees, year by year, for the house of Yahweh. 36 And the firstborn of our sons and beasts—as it is written in the law—and the firstborn of our cattle and sheep, to bring to the house of our God and to the priests serving in the house of our God. 37 And we bring the best of our dough, our offerings, the fruit of every tree, new wine, and olive oil to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and to bring the tithe of our soil to the Levites, for the Levites receive the tithes in all of our rural towns. 38 And the priest, the descendant of Aaron, will be with the Levites during the tithe the Levites receive. The Levites will bring up a tithe of the tithes for the house of our God to the chambers of the storehouse. 39 For the Israelites and the Levites will bring to the storerooms the offering of grain, new wine, and olive oil. These are the objects of the sanctuary and the priests who minister and the gatekeepers and singers. We will not neglect the house of our God.” 1 Now the commanders of the people lived in Jerusalem, but the remainder of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in the holy city of Jerusalem, the other nine’s place was in the other cities. 2 And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered to live in Jerusalem. 3 These are the heads of the province who lived in Jerusalem, but in the cities of Judah each one lived on his property in their cities: Israel, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants, and the descendants of Solomon’s servants. 4 And some from the descendants of Judah and Benjamin lived in Jerusalem. From the descendants of Judah: Athaiah son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of Mahalalel, from the descendants of Perez; 5 and Maaseiah son of Baruch, son of Col-Hozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Jehoiarib, son of Zechariah, son of the Shilonite. 6 All of the descendants of Perez who were living in Jerusalem were four hundred and sixty-eight able-bodied men. 7 These are the descendants of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam, son of Joed, son of Pedaiah, son of Kolaiah, son of Maaseiah, son of Ithiel, son of Jeshaiah. 8 And following after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred and twenty-eight. 9 And Joel son of Zicri, their chief officer; and Judah son of Hassenuah, second in command over the city. 10 From the priests: Jedaiah son of Jehoiarib, Jakin, 11 Seraiah son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son of Zadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub—the leader of the house of God— 12 and their brothers who did the work of the house, eight hundred and twenty-two. And Adaiah son of Jeroham, son of Pelaliah, son of Amzi, son of Zechariah, son of Pashhur, son of Malkijah, 13 and his brothers, heads of the families, two hundred and forty-two. And Amashai son of Azarel, son of Ahzai, son of Meshillemoth, son of Immer, 14 and their brothers; mighty warriors of strength, one hundred and twenty-eight. The chief officer over them was Zabdiel son of Hagedolim. 15 Now from the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, son of Bunni; 16 and Shabbethai and Jehozabad, leaders over the work of the Levites outside of the house of God; 17 Mattaniah son of Micah, son of Zabdi, son of Asaph, who was the leader to begin the thanksgiving prayer, and Bakbukiah the second of his brothers; Abda son of Shammua, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun. 18 All of the Levites in the holy city were two hundred and eighty-four. 19 The gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their brothers, the keepers of the gates, one hundred and seventy-two. 20 And the remainder of Israel, the priests and the Levites, in all of the cities of Judah, each in his inheritance. 21 But the temple servants were living on the Ophel; Ziha and Gishpa were over the temple servants. 22 The chief officer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mica, from the descendants of Asaph, the singers over the work of the house of God. 23 For there was a command of the king concerning them and a regulation concerning the singers, required day by day. 24 And Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, from the descendants of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the hand of the king in all matters concerning the people. 25 As for the villages in their territories, some from the descendants of Judah lived in Kiriath-Arba and its settlements, Dibon and its settlements, Jekabzeel and its settlements, 26 Jeshua, Moladah, Beth Pelet, 27 Hazar Shual, Beersheba and its settlements, 28 Ziklad, Meconah and its settlements, 29 En-Rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuch, 30 Zanoah, Adullam and their settlements, Lachish and its fields, and Azekah and its settlements. So they camped from Beersheba up to the Valley of Hinnom. 31 The descendants of Benjamin from Geba, Micmash, Aija, Bethel and their settlements, 32 Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 35 Lod, and Ono the valley of the artisans. 36 And from the Levites the working groups of Judah were assigned to Benjamin. 1 These are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 2 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 3 Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 4 Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, 5 Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, 6 Shemaiah, Jehoiarib, Jedaiah, 7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These are the heads of the priests and their brothers in the days of Jeshua. 8 And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah and his brothers who were in charge of the songs of thanksgiving. 9 And Bakbukiah, Unno, their brothers stood opposite them during service. 10 Jeshua fathered Jehoiakim; Jehoiakim fathered Eliashib; Eliashib fathered Jehoiada; 11 Jehoiada fathered Jehonathan; Jehonathan fathered Jaddua. 12 Now in the days of Jehoiakim the priests and the heads of the families were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; 13 of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 14 of Melichu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; 15 of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; 16 of Adaia, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; 17 of Abijah, Zicri; of Miniamin; of Moadiah, Piltai; 18 of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 19 of Jehoiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; 20 of Sallu, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 21 of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; and of Jedaiah, Nethanel. 22 In the days of Eliashib, Jehoiada, Jehohanan, and Jaddua the Levites were recorded as heads of the families. So these were the priests during the reign of Darius the Persian. 23 The descendants of Levi and the heads of the families were recorded in the scroll of the Annals until the days of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. 24 And the heads of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their brothers opposite them, to praise and to give thanks by the command of David the man of God, section alongside section. 25 Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers standing guard at the storerooms of the gates. 26 These were in the days of Jehoiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jehozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe. 27 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites from all of their places in order to bring them to Jerusalem to do the dedication with joy, thanksgivings, song and cymbals, stringed instruments and lyres. 28 The singers were gathered from the circuit all around Jerusalem and from the villages of Netophathite, 29 from Beth Gilgal, from the field of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers built for themselves villages all around Jerusalem. 30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves and purified the people, the gates, and the wall. 31 Then I brought the commanders of Judah up on to the wall. I appointed two great choirs; one went in a procession to the right on the wall to the Dung Gate. 32 After them went Hoshaiah, half of the commanders of Judah, 33 Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 35 and the priests with trumpets; Zechariah son of Jehonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph; 36 and his brothers Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani with the instruments of the songs of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe went before them. 37 At the Fountain Gate opposite them they went up the steps of the city of David, at the assent to the wall, over the house of David, and up to the Water Gate to the east. 38 Then the second choir went the opposite way. I followed after them with half of the people on the wall, from over the Tower of the Ovens up to the Wide Wall 39 and over the Gate of Ephraim, at the Old Gate, at the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, and to the Sheep Gate. And they stopped and stood at the Gate of the Guard. 40 So the two choirs stood in the house of God, and I and half of the prefects with me; 41 and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah with the trumpets; 42 Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang with Jizrahiah the chief officer. 43 They offered on that day great sacrifices and rejoiced because God brought great joy to them. And the women and children also rejoiced. The joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar. 44 On that day men were appointed for the storehouse rooms, the offerings, the first fruits, and the tithes, in order to gather in them from the fields of the cities the requirements of the law for the priests and Levites; for the joy of Judah was upon the priests and Levites standing there. 45 They kept the responsibility of their God and the responsibility of cleansing, and the singers and gatekeepers, according to the command of David and his son Solomon. 46 For in the days of David and Asaph from ancient times there was the head of the singers and a song of praise and thanksgiving to God. 47 So all of Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the daily food portions of the singers and gatekeepers. And they set apart that which was for the Levites, and the Levites set apart that which was for the descendants of Aaron. 1 On that day the book of Moses was read in the hearing of the people and it was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God 2 because they did not come to meet the Israelites with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them in order to curse them—but our God changed the curse into a blessing. 3 So it happened when they heard the law that they separated all of the foreign people from Israel. 4 Before this, Eliashib the priest who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God—the one related to Tobiah— 5 prepared for Tobiah a large chamber where they had formerly put the grain offering, the frankincense, the temple objects, tithes of grain, wine, and oil commanded for the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the offerings of the priests. 6 During all of this, I was not in Jerusalem because in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king. At the end of some days I asked permission from the king to leave. 7 So I came to Jerusalem. And I came to learn of the wrong that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by making him a room in the courtyard of the house of God. 8 It was very displeasing for me, and I threw all of the objects from the house of Tobiah outside of the chamber. 9 And I spoke in order, and they cleansed the chambers. Then I returned the objects of the house of God—the grain offering and the frankincense. 10 And then I came to learn that the food of the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers, the doers of the work, had gone back each to his field. 11 So I quarreled with the prefects, and I said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them and set them at their station. 12 So all of Judah brought the tithe of grain, new wine, and olive oil into the storehouses. 13 I appointed as treasurer over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, Pedaiah from the Levites, and as their hand Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, for they were considered faithful. The responsibility given to them was to distribute to their brothers. 14 Remember me, my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my loyal acts which I have done in the house of my God and in his service. 15 In those days I saw in Judah people treading the wine press on the Sabbath, bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys along with wine, grapes and figs, and every kind of burden and bringing it all to Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath. And I warned them at that time against selling food. 16 Tyrian men who lived in Jerusalem brought fish and every kind of merchandise and sold it on the Sabbath to the descendants of Judah and in Jerusalem. 17 So I quarreled with the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the day of the Sabbath? 18 Did not your ancestors do this also, and our God brought on us all of this disaster and on this city too? Now you are adding fierce wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath!” 19 So when it became dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors be shut and said that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I appointed some of my young men over the gates to prevent any goods being brought in on the day of the Sabbath. 20 So the merchants and the sellers of merchandise spent the night outside of Jerusalem once or twice. 21 But I warned them and said to them, “Why are you spending the night opposite the wall? If you do it again, I will lay hands against you.” From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath. 22 And then I told two Levites that they must purify themselves and come to guard the gates in order to consecrate the day of the Sabbath. Remember this also, my God, and take pity on me according to the greatness of your loyal love. 23 Also in those days I saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 24 Half of their children spoke Ashdodite and could not speak Judean, but only the tongues of other nations. 25 So I quarreled with them and cursed them and beat some of their men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath by God: “Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. 26 Did not King Solomon of Israel sin in this way? And among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Yet the foreign women made even him sin. 27 Should we listen to you all and do this great evil, acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?” 28 One from the sons of Jehoiada, son of the high priest Eliashib, who was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonote was there. I chased him away from me. 29 Remember them, my God, because of their defilements of the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites. 30 So I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established responsibilities for the priests and Levites, each in his own work, 31 a contribution of the wood offering at appointed times, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good.

Ezra,"1 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to accomplish the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah, Yahweh stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia and he sent a message to all of his kingdom and also put the message in writing: 2 “Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: Yahweh, the God of the heavens, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. And he himself has appointed me to build a house for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

Ezra,"1 Now the seventh month drew near and the Israelites were in the cities, so the people gathered as one in Jerusalem. 2 And Jeshua son of Jehozadak and his brothers the priests stood up, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers built the altar of the God of Israel, in order to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God. 3 They set up the altar on its foundations, because they were in terror because of the peoples of the lands. And they offered burnt offerings on it for Yahweh, burnt offerings for the morning and the evening. 4 And they kept the feast of booths, as it is written, and offered burnt offerings day by day in number according to the ordinance as described for each day. 5 After this, they presented the daily sacrifice of burnt offerings, the offerings for the New Moon Festival, and for all of the appointed times consecrated for Yahweh and for all who gave a freewill offering to Yahweh. 6 From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh. But the temple of Yahweh was not yet founded. 7 So they gave money to the stone craftsmen and skilled craftsmen, and food, drink, and olive oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the authorization over them of Cyrus king of Persia. 8 In the second year after their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jehozadak began their work, and the remainder of their brothers the priests and the Levites and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem. They appointed the Levites from twenty years and older to direct the work of the house of Yahweh. 9 And Jeshua with his sons and brothers, and Kadmiel and his sons—the sons of Judah—together directed the workers in the house of God, along with the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers the Levites. 10 And the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Yahweh, and the priests in their apparel with the trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with the cymbals, were positioned to praise Yahweh, as described by King David of Israel. 11 And they sang responsively, with praising and thanksgiving to Yahweh saying, “For he is good, for his loyal love is everlasting for Israel.” And all of the people responded with a great shout of joyful acclaim in praise to Yahweh because the house of Yahweh was laid. 12 But many of the elderly priests, Levites, and heads of the families who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house, but many shouted aloud with joy. 13 No person could distinguish the sound of joyful acclaim from the sound of people weeping, for the people shouted with great joyful acclaim and the sound was heard from afar. 1 Now the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple for Yahweh the God of Israel. 2 And they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the families, and they said to them, “Let us build with you. Like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him from the days of Esarhaddon the king of Assyria who brought us up here. 3 But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel said to them, “It is not for you but for us to build a house for our God. For we ourselves alone will build it for Yahweh the God of Israel, just as Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.” 4 Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah and made them afraid to build 5 and bribed officials against them to frustrate their plan for all the days of Cyrus king of Persia until the reign of Darius king of Persia. 6 In the reign of Ahasuerus, at the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. 7 And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their colleagues wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. The letter was written in Aramaic and translated from Aramaic. 8 Rehum the royal officer and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows 9 (then Rehum the royal officer, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the judges, the envoys, the officials, the Persians, the Erechs, the Babylonians, the Susians (that is the Elamites) 10 and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and the rest of the province Beyond the River) and now 11 this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him: “To King Artaxerxes from your servants, the men of the province Beyond the River. And now, 12 be it known to the king that the Jews who have come up from near you to us have gone to Jerusalem. They are building the rebellious and wicked city. They are finishing the wall and repairing the foundation. 13 Now be it known to the king that if this city is built and the walls are finished, they will not pay tribute and toll, and the royal revenue will be reduced. 14 Now since we eat the salt of the palace and the dishonor of the king is not proper for us to see, we send and make this known to the king, 15 so that it may be investigated in the book of records of your ancestors. You will find in the book of records and learn that this city is a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces, and they have rebelled in its midst from ancient times. Because of that this city was destroyed. 16 We make known to the king that if this city is built and the walls are finished, you will have nothing in the province Beyond the River.” 17 The king sent a reply: “To Rehum the royal officer, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and the rest of the province Beyond the River, greetings. And now 18 the letter that you sent to us has been translated and read before me. 19 And I issued a decree, and they searched and found that this city from ancient days revolted against kings, and rebellion and sedition has been made in it. 20 Mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem, governing all the province Beyond the River, to whom tribute, duty, and tax has been given. 21 So now, issue forth a decree that these men stop and this city not be built, until a decree is issued from me. 22 And be careful not to be negligent on this matter. Why should damage grow to hurt kings?” 23 Then when a copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates they returned in a hurry to Jerusalem against the Jews and they stopped them by force and power. 24 Then the work on the house of God in Jerusalem stopped, and was discontinued until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

Ezra,"1 Now the prophets, Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and in Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them. 2 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak set out and began to build the house of God that is in Jerusalem. And with them the prophets of God were helping them. 3 At the same time Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their associates came to them and spoke to them thus: “Who issued you all a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?” 4 Then we asked them this: “What are the names of the men who are building this building?” 5 And the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until the report came to Darius, and then answer was received. 6 The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and his associates the envoys who were in the province Beyond the River sent to Darius the king. 7 They sent to him the report in which was written as follows: “To Darius the king, all peace. 8 May it be known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, the house of the great God. It is being built with stone blocks and timber is being put in the walls. This work is being done with diligence and is making progress in their hands. 9 Then we asked those elders and said this to them, ‘Who issued forth to you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?’ 10 We also asked them their names to make them known to you, that we might write down the name of their leaders. 11 And this is the answer they returned to us: ‘We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building the house that was built formerly many years ago, which a great king of Israel had built and finished. 12 But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he gave them into the hand of the Chaldean King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. He destroyed this house and carried away the people to Babylonia. 13 But in the first year of King Cyrus of Babylon’s reign he issued forth a decree to build this house of God. 14 Also, the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took away from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple in Babylonia, King Cyrus removed them from the temple in Babylonia and they were given to Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed governor. 15 He said to him, ‘Take these vessels. Go put them in the temple in Jerusalem and let the house of God be built on its site.’ 16 Then this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem. And from that time until now it is being built, but not yet finished.’ 17 And now, if it seems good for the king, let it be investigated in the house of the treasury of the king in Babylonia to see if a decree was issued forth from King Cyrus to build this house of God in Jerusalem. And let the king send to us his desire on this matter.” 1 Then King Darius issued forth a decree, and they searched the house of the treasury of scrolls being stored in Babylonia. 2 But it was in Ecbatana in the province of Media, in the citadel, that a certain scroll had written on it, “A record. 3 In the first year of King Cyrus, he issued forth a decree concerning the house of God in Jerusalem. Let the house be built, the place where sacrifices are offered and let its foundations be raised. Its height shall be sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits, 4 with three layers of great stones and a layer of timber. Let the new expenses be paid from the house of the king. 5 Also, let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylonia, be returned and brought to the temple in Jerusalem to its place. Put them in the house of God.” 6 “Now then, Tattenai governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates, the envoys who are in the province Beyond the River—keep far away from there. 7 Leave this work of the house of God alone. Let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site. 8 And I issue forth a decree for what you should do for these elders of the Jews to build this house of God. The full expense will be paid to these men from the riches of the king from the taxes of the province Beyond the River, without delay. 9 Whatever may be needed—young bulls, young rams, sheep for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil for the priests in Jerusalem—let it be given to them day by day with no negligence, 10 that they may offer incense offerings to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and his children. 11 Furthermore, I issue forth a decree that if any person violates this decree, let a beam be pulled out from his house and let him be impaled on it. And let his house be made a pile of rubble on account of this. 12 May the God who has set his name there overthrow any king or people who sets his hand to alter or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, issue forth a decree. Let it be done with diligence.” 13 Then Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates consequently did with diligence what Darius the king ordered. 14 So the elders of the Jews were building and prospering, through the prophecy of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo. They finished building by the command of the God of Israel and by the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and King Artaxerxes of Persia. 15 This house was completed on the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. 16 And the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the returned exiles celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy. 17 And they offered during the dedication of this house of God one hundred young bulls, two hundred young rams, four hundred lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering for Israel according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 18 Then they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their sections for the work of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses. 19 On the fourteenth day of the first month the returned exiles observed the Passover feast. 20 For the priests and Levites together had consecrated themselves; all of them were clean. And they slaughtered the Passover sacrifice for all of the returned exiles, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves. 21 The Israelites who returned from the exile and all those who separated themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the earth to seek Yahweh the God of Israel, ate. 22 With joy they celebrated the festival of unleavened bread for seven days, because Yahweh had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them in order to help them with the work of their hands on the house of the God of Israel.

Ezra,"1 After these things during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, 2 son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, 3 son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth, 4 , son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki, 5 son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest— 6 this Ezra went up from Babylonia. He was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses, which Yahweh the God of Israel gave. The king granted him all his requests, for the hand of Yahweh was upon him. 7 Some of the Israelites, some priests and Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes. 8 He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. 9 For on the first day of the first month he began the journey from Babylonia; and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was on him. 10 For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Yahweh, to do it, and to teach the regulations and judgments in Israel. 11 This is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the scroll of the words of the commands of Yahweh and his statutes for Israel: 12 “Artaxerxes, the king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of the heavens. Peace. And now 13 I issue forth a decree that any of the people of Israel, their priests, or their Levites in my kingdom who are willing to go to Jerusalem may go with you. 14 For you are sent from the king and his seven counselors to enquire about Judah and Jerusalem concerning the law of your God, which is in your hand. 15 Also, bring the silver and gold that the king and his advisors have freely offered to the God of Israel whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, 16 and all of the silver and gold that you will find in the whole province of Babylonia, with the freewill offerings of the people and the priests giving willingly for the house of their God in Jerusalem. 17 With this money, then, with diligence you must buy young bulls, young rams, lambs, and their offerings and libations. You must offer them on the altar that is in the house of your God in Jerusalem. 18 You may do whatever seems best to you and your brothers to do with the remainder of the silver and gold according to the desire of your God. 19 And the vessels that were given to you for the service of the house of your God you shall deliver before the God of Jerusalem. 20 And the remainder of the needs for the house of your God that falls to you to provide, you may provide from the house of the king’s treasury.” 21 “I, even I, King Artaxerxes, issue forth a decree to all the treasurers who are in the province Beyond the River. Whatever the priest Ezra, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, may ask of you, let it be done with diligence, 22 up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred measures of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and unlimited salt. 23 All that is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done with diligence for the house of the God of heaven, otherwise wrath will come on the kingdom of the king and his sons. 24 You also should be aware that it is not permitted to place tax, tribute, or duty upon all of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the doorkeepers, the temple servants, and other servants of the house of God. 25 “You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that you possess, appoint magistrates and judges who can judge all of the people in the province Beyond the River who know the laws of your God. And you will teach those who do not know. 26 All who do not obey the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed on him with diligence, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of goods and for imprisonment.” 27 Blessed be Yahweh the God of our ancestors, who put this in the heart of the king to glorify the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem 28 and who extended to me loyal love before the king and his counselors, and before all of the mighty officials of the king. I took courage, for the hand of Yahweh my God was upon me, and I gathered leaders from Israel to go up with me. 1 These were the heads of their families and the register of those returnees from Babylonia who came up with me in the reign of King Artaxerxes: 2 From the descendants of Phinehas: Gershom. From the descendants of Ithamar: Daniel. From the descendants of David: Hattush. 3 From the descendants of Shecaniah, from the descendants of Parosh: Zechariah and with him one hundred and fifty registered males. 4 From the descendants of Pahath-Moab: Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah and with him two hundred males. 5 From the descendants of Zattu: Shecaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males. 6 From the descendants of Adin: Ebed son of Jehonathan, and with him fifty males. 7 From the descendants of Elam: Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males. 8 From the descendants of Shephatiah: Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him eighty males. 9 From the descendants of Joab: Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males. 10 From the descendants of Bani: Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him one hundred and sixty males. 11 From the descendants of Bebai: Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males. 12 From the descendants of Azgad: Jehohanan son of Haqqatan, and with him one hundred and ten males. 13 From the descendants of Adonikam, those who came last, these were their names: Eliphelet, Jeiel, Shemaiah, and with them sixty males. 14 From the descendants of Bigvai: Uthai son of Zabud, and with him seventy males. 15 I gathered them by the river that goes to Ahava and we camped there for three days. And I looked at the people and the priests, I found no one there from the sons of Levi. 16 And I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were family heads, and for Jehoiarib and Elnathan who were wise. 17 I sent them to Iddo, the head of the place called Casiphia, and I placed in their mouths what words to say to Iddo and his brothers the temple servants in Casiphia, to send to us ministers for the house of our God. 18 With the good hand of our God before us, they brought us a man of understanding from the sons of Mahli, son of Levi, son of Israel—Sherebiah and his sons and brothers, eighteen in total. 19 Also Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah, the sons of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, twenty in total. 20 And from the temple servants, whom David and his officials had set up to serve the Levites, two hundred and twenty in total. All of them were registered by name. 21 I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava to humble ourselves before our God in order to seek from him a safe journey for us, our children, and our possessions. 22 For I was ashamed to ask the king for troops and horses to protect us from enemies on the way because we said to the king, “the hand of our God is favorable to all who seek him, but his strength and anger are against all who forsake them.” 23 So we fasted and sought our God for this and he responded to our prayer. 24 I set apart twelve of the official priests: Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them. 25 Then I weighed out to them silver and gold and the vessels, the offering of the house of our God that the king, his counselors, his commanders, and all of Israel who was present offered. 26 I weighed out into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, one hundred vessels of silver, one hundred talents of gold, 27 twenty gold bowls worth one thousand darics, and two vessels of good polished bronze as precious as gold. 28 And I said to them, “You are holy to Yahweh and the vessels are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh, God of your ancestors. 29 Guard and look after them until you weigh them before the chief priests, the Levites, and the heads of the families of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chamber of the house of Yahweh.” 30 So the priests and Levites took over the weighed silver, gold, and the vessels to bring to Jerusalem for the house of our God. 31 On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the river of Ahava to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushing on the way. 32 We came to Jerusalem and remained there three days. 33 On the fourth day, the silver, gold, and vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of priest Meremoth, the son of Uriah, and with him Eleazar son of Phinehas. With them were the Levites, Jehozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 34 The amount and weight of all the weighed items was recorded at that time. 35 The exiles that returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel; twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve goats as a sin offering. All was a burnt offering to Yahweh. 36 They delivered the customs of the king to the king’s satraps and to the governor of the province Beyond the River. And they supported the people of the house of God.

1 Corinthians,"13 Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? 14 I give thanks that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, 15 lest anyone should say that you were baptized in my name. 16 (Now I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Beyond that I do not know if I baptized anyone else.) 17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the gospel, not with clever speech, lest the cross of Christ be emptied. 18 For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will confound.” 20 Where is the wise person? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe. 22 For indeed, Jews ask for sign miracles and Greeks seek wisdom, 23 but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a cause for stumbling, but to the Gentiles foolishness, 24 but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. 26 For consider your calling, brothers, that not many were wise according to human standards, not many were powerful, not many were well born. 27 But the foolish things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the wise, and the weak things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the strong, 28 and the insignificant of the world, and the despised, God chose, the things that are not, in order that he might abolish the things that are, 29 so that all flesh may not boast before God. 30 But from him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, 31 so that, just as it is written, “The one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.” ",1 Corinthians 1:13-31,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-corinthians-113-31-324655/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-02-21_1-corinthians-113-31_20130204164656.mp3
1 Corinthians,"1 And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God. 2 For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 3 And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling, 4 and my speech and my preaching were not with the persuasiveness of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and power, 5 in order that your faith would not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 6 Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, but wisdom not of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are perishing, 7 but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, which God predestined before the ages for our glory, 8 which none of the rulers of this age knew. For if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 9 But just as it is written, “Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and have not entered into the heart of man, all that God has prepared for those who love him.” 10 For to us God has revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. 11 For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man that is in him? Thus also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. 12 Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, in order that we may know the things freely given to us by God, 13 things which we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people. 14 But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is not able to understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. 15 Now the spiritual person discerns all things, but he himself is judged by no one. 16 “For who has known the mind of the Lord; who has advised him?” But we have the mind of Christ.

1 Corinthians,"1 And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual people, but as to fleshly people, as to infants in Christ. 2 I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to eat it. But now you are still not able, 3 for you are still fleshly. For where there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and do you not live like unregenerate people? 4 For whenever anyone says, “I am with Paul,” and another, “I am with Apollos,” are you not merely human? 5 Therefore, what is Apollos and what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave. 6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing it to grow. 7 So then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who is causing it to grow. 8 Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one, but each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor. 9 For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building. 10 According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building upon it. But each one must direct his attention to how he is building upon it. 11 For no one is able to lay another foundation than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12 Now if anyone builds upon the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw, 13 the work of each one will become evident. For the day will reveal it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the work of each one, of what sort it is. 14 If anyone’s work that he has built upon it remains, he will receive a reward. 15 If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but so as through fire. 16 Do you not know that you are God’s temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you? 17 If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy this one. For God’s temple is holy, which you are. 18 Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks himself to be wise among you in this age, let him become a fool, in order that he may become wise. 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it is written, “The one who catches the wise in their craftiness,” 20 and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.” 21 So then, let no one boast in people. For all things are yours, 22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all things are yours, 23 and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.

1 Corinthians,"1 Thus let a person consider us as servants of Christ and stewards of God’s mysteries. 2 In this case, moreover, it is sought in stewards that one be found faithful. 3 But to me it is a very little matter that I be judged by you or by a human court, but I do not even judge myself. 4 For I am conscious of nothing against myself, but not by this am I vindicated. But the one who judges me is the Lord. 5 Therefore do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord should come, who will both enlighten the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the counsels of hearts, and then praise will come to each one from God. 6 Now I have applied these things, brothers, to myself and Apollos for your sake, in order that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, lest someone be inflated with pride on behalf of one person against the other. 7 For who concedes you superiority? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if indeed you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it? 8 Already you are satiated! Already you are rich! Apart from us you reign as kings! And would that indeed you reigned as kings, in order that we also might reign as kings with you! 9 For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as condemned to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to people. 10 We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are prudent in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, but we are dishonored! 11 Until the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty and poorly clothed and roughly treated and homeless, 12 and we toil, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure; 13 when we are slandered, we encourage. We have become like the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things, until now. 14 I am not writing these things to shame you, but admonishing you as my dear children. 15 For if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I fathered you through the gospel. 16 Therefore I exhort you, become imitators of me. 17 Because of this, I have sent to you Timothy, who is my dear and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ Jesus, just as I teach everywhere in every church. 18 But some have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you. 19 But I am coming to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the talk of the ones who have become arrogant, but the power. 20 For the kingdom of God is not with talk, but with power. 21 What do you want?

1 Corinthians,"1 It is reported everywhere that there is sexual immorality among you, and sexual immorality of such a kind which does not even exist among the Gentiles, so that someone has the wife of his father. 2 And you are inflated with pride, and should you not rather have mourned, so that the one who has done this deed would be removed from your midst? 3 For although I am absent in body but present in spirit, I have already passed judgment on the one who has done this in this way, as if I were present. 4 In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and my spirit, together with the power of our Lord Jesus, 5 I have decided to hand over such a person to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, in order that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord. 6 Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough? 7 Clean out the old leaven in order that you may be a new batch of dough, just as you are unleavened. For Christ our Passover has been sacrificed. 8 So then, let us celebrate the feast, not with the old leaven or with the leaven of wickedness and sinfulness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 9 I wrote to you in the letter not to associate with sexually immoral people. 10 By no means did I mean the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy people and swindlers or idolaters, since then you would have to depart out of the world. 11 But now I have written to you not to associate with any so-called brother, if he is a sexually immoral person or a greedy person or an idolater or an abusive person or a drunkard or a swindler—with such a person not even to eat. 12 For what is it to me to judge those outside?

1 Corinthians,"1 Does anyone among you, if he has a matter against someone else, dare to go to court before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? 2 Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if by you the world is judged, are you unworthy of the most insignificant courts? 3 Do you not know that we will judge angels, not to mention ordinary matters? 4 Therefore, if you have courts with regard to ordinary matters, do you seat these despised people in the church? 5 I say this to your shame. So is there not anyone wise among you who will be able to render a decision between his brothers? 6 But brother goes to court with brother, and this before unbelievers! 7 Therefore it is already completely a loss for you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded? 8 But you wrong and defraud, and do this to brothers! 9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Neither sexually immoral people, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor passive homosexual partners, nor dominant homosexual partners, 10 nor thieves, nor greedy persons, not drunkards, not abusive persons, not swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And some of you were these things, but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God. 12 All things are permitted for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are permitted for me, but I will not be controlled by anything. 13 Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for food, but God will abolish both of them. Now the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 14 And God both raised up the Lord and will raise us up by his power. 15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Therefore, shall I take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be! 16 Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For it says, “The two will become one flesh.” 17 But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with him. 18 Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a person commits is outside his body, but the one who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. 19 Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? 20 For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God with your body.

1 Corinthians,"1 Now concerning the things about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.” 2 But because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband. 3 The husband must fulfill his obligation to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. 4 The wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does. And likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but his wife does. 5 Do not defraud one another, except perhaps by agreement, for a time, in order that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then you should be together again, lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self control. 6 But I say this as a concession, not as a command. 7 I wish all people could be like myself, but each one has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that way. 8 Now I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain as I am. 9 But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire. 10 To the married I command—not I, but the Lord—a wife must not separate from her husband. 11 But if indeed she does separate, she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. 12 Now to the rest I say—not the Lord—if any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her. 13 And if any wife has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her, she must not divorce her husband. 14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother, since otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy. 15 But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. The brother or the sister is not bound in such cases. But God has called us in peace. 16 For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? 17 But to each one as the Lord has apportioned. As God has called each one, thus let him live—and thus I order in all the churches. 18 Was anyone called after being circumcised? He must not undo his circumcision. Was anyone called in uncircumcision? He must not become circumcised. 19 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. 20 Each one in the calling in which he was called—in this he should remain. 21 Were you called while a slave? Do not let it be a concern to you. But if indeed you are able to become free, rather make use of it.

1 Corinthians,"20 Each one in the calling in which he was called—in this he should remain. 21 Were you called while a slave? Do not let it be a concern to you. But if indeed you are able to become free, rather make use of it. 22 For the one who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord’s freedperson. Likewise the one who is called while free is a slave of Christ. 23 You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. 24 Each one in the situation in which he was called, brothers—in this he should remain with God. 25 Now concerning virgins I do not have a command from the Lord, but I am giving an opinion as one shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy. 26 Therefore, I consider this to be good because of the impending distress, that it is good for a man to be thus. 27 Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek release. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 28 But if you marry, you have not sinned, and if the virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such people will have affliction in the flesh, and I would spare you. 29 But I say this, brothers: the time is shortened, that from now on even those who have wives should be as if they do not have wives, 30 and those who weep as if they do not weep, and those who rejoice as if they do not rejoice, and those who buy as if they do not possess, 31 and those who make use of the world as if they do not make full use of it. For the present form of this world is passing away. 32 But I want you to be free from care. The unmarried person cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord. 33 But the one who is married cares for the things of the world, how he may please his wife, 34 and he is divided. And the unmarried woman or the virgin cares for the things of the Lord, in order that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But the married woman cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. 35 Now I am saying this for your own benefit, not that I may put a restriction on you, but to promote appropriate and devoted service to the Lord without distraction. 36 But if anyone thinks he is behaving dishonorably concerning his virgin, if she is past her prime and it ought to be thus, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin. Let them marry. 37 But he who stands firm in his heart, not having necessity, but has authority concerning his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin, he will do well. 38 So then, the one who marries his own virgin does well, and the one who does not marry her will do better. 39 A wife is bound for as long a time as her husband lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry whomever she wishes, only in the Lord. 40 But she is happier if she remains thus, according to my opinion—and I think I have the Spirit of God.

1 Corinthians,"1 Now concerning food sacrificed to idols, we know that “we all have knowledge.” Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. 2 If anyone thinks he knows anything, he has not yet known as it is necessary to know. 3 But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him. 4 Therefore, concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that “an idol is nothing in the world” and that “there is no God except one.” 5 For even if after all there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many gods and many lords, 6 yet to us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we are for him, and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we are through him. 7 But this knowledge is not in everyone. But some, being accustomed until now to the idol, eat this food as food sacrificed to idols, and their conscience, because it is weak, is defiled. 8 But food does not bring us close to God. For neither if we eat do we have more, nor if we do not eat do we lack. 9 But watch out lest somehow this right of yours becomes a cause for stumbling to the weak. 10 For if someone should see you who has knowledge reclining for a meal in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, because it is weak, be strengthened so that he eats the food sacrificed to idols? 11 For the one who is weak—the brother for whom Christ died—is destroyed by your knowledge. 12 Now if you sin in this way against the brothers and wound their conscience, which is weak, you sin against Christ. 13 Therefore, if food causes my brother to sin, I will never eat meat forever, in order that I may not cause my brother to sin.

1 Corinthians,"1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? 2 If to others I am not an apostle, yet indeed I am to you, for you are my seal of apostleship in the Lord. 3 My defense to those who examine me is this: 4 Do we not have the right to eat and drink? 5 Do we not have the right to take along a sister as wife, like the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? 6 Or do only I and Barnabas not have the right to refrain from working? 7 Who ever serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it? Who shepherds a flock and does not drink from the milk of the flock? 8 I am not saying these things according to a human perspective. Or does the law not also say these things? 9 For in the law of Moses it is written, “You must not muzzle an ox while it is threshing.” It is not about oxen God is concerned, is it? 10 Or doubtless does he speak for our sake? For it is written for our sake, because the one who plows ought to plow in hope and the one who threshes ought to do so in hope of a share. 11 If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too great a thing if we reap material things from you? 12 If others share this right over you, do we not do so even more? Yet we have not made use of this right, but we endure all things, in order that we may not cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ. 13 Do you not know that those performing the holy services eat the things from the temple, and those attending to the altar have a share with the altar? 14 In the same way also the Lord ordered those who proclaim the gospel to live from the gospel. 15 But I have not made use of any of these rights. And I am not writing these things in order that it may be thus with me. For it would be better to me rather to die than for anyone to deprive me of my reason for boasting. 16 For if I proclaim the gospel, it is not to me a reason for boasting, for necessity is imposed on me. For woe is to me if I do not proclaim the gospel. 17 For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward, but if I do so unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship. 18 What then is my reward? That when I proclaim the gospel, I may offer the gospel free of charge, in order not to make full use of my right in the gospel. 19 For although I am free from all people, I have enslaved myself to all, in order that I may gain more. 20 I have become like a Jew to the Jews, in order that I may gain the Jews. To those under the law I became as under the law (although I myself am not under the law) in order that I may gain those under the law. 21 To those outside the law I became as outside the law (although I am not outside the law of God, but subject to the law of Christ) in order that I may gain those outside the law. 22 To the weak I became weak, in order that I may gain the weak. I have become all things to all people, in order that by all means I may save some. 23 I do all this for the sake of the gospel, in order that I may become a participant with it. 24 Do you not know that those who run in the stadium all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win. 25 And everyone who competes exercises self-control in all things. Thus those do so in order that they may receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one. 26 Therefore I run in this way, not as running aimlessly; I box in this way, not as beating the air. 27 But I discipline my body and subjugate it, lest somehow after preaching to others, I myself should become disqualified.

1 Corinthians,"1 For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all went through the sea, 2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, 3 and all ate the same spiritual food, 4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. 5 But God was not pleased with the majority of them, for they were struck down in the desert. 6 Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we should not be desirers of evil things, just as those also desired them, 7 and not become idolaters, as some of them did, just as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play,” 8 nor commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed sexual immorality, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day, 9 nor put Christ to the test, as some of them tested him, and were destroyed by snakes, 10 nor grumble, just as some of them grumbled, and were destroyed by the destroyer. 11 Now these things happened to those people as an example, but are written for our instruction, on whom the ends of the ages have come. 12 Therefore, the one who thinks that he stands must watch out lest he fall. 13 Temptation has not come upon you except what is common to humanity. But God is faithful, who will not permit you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but will also make a way out together with the temptation, so that you may be able to endure it. 14 Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. 15 I am speaking as to sensible people; you judge what I am saying. 16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? 17 Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all share from the one bread. 18 Consider Israel according to the flesh: are not the ones who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar? 19 Therefore, what am I saying? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? 20 No, but that the things which they sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to become sharers with demons. 21 You are not able to drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You are not able to share the table of the Lord and the table of demons. 22 Or are we attempting to provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than he is, are we?

1 Corinthians,"23 All things are permitted, but not all things are profitable. All things are permitted, but not all things build up. 24 Let no one seek his own good but the good of the other. 25 Eat everything that is sold in the meat market, asking no questions for the sake of the conscience, 26 for “the earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness.” 27 If any of the unbelievers invites you, and you want to go, eat everything that is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of the conscience. 28 But if someone says to you, “This is offered to idols,” do not eat it, for the sake of that one who informed you and the conscience. 29 Now I am not speaking about your own conscience, but the conscience of the other person. For why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience? 30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks? 31 Therefore, whether you eat or you drink or whatever you do, do all things for the glory of God. 32 Give no offense both to Jews and to Greeks and to the church of God, 33 just as I also please all people in all things, not seeking my own benefit, but the benefit of the many, in order that they may be saved. 1 Become imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ. 2 Now I praise you that you remember me in all things, and just as I handed over to you the traditions, you hold fast to them. 3 But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and the head of Christ is God. 4 Every man who prays or prophesies while having something on his head dishonors his head, ",1 Corinthians 10:23-11:4,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-corinthians-1023114-324666/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-03-08_1-corinthians-1023114_20130204165519.mp3
1 Corinthians,"4 Every man who prays or prophesies while having something on his head dishonors his head, 5 but every woman who prays or prophesies with uncovered head dishonors her head, for she is one and the same with the one whose head is shaved. 6 For if a woman does not cover herself, let her hair be shorn off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her head shorn or shaved, let her cover her head. 7 For indeed a man ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man. 8 For man is not from woman, but woman from man. 9 For indeed man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man. 10 Because of this, the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, on account of the angels. 11 Nevertheless, neither is woman anything apart from man, nor is man anything apart from woman in the Lord. 12 For just as the woman is from the man, thus also the man is through the woman. But all things are from God. 13 You judge for yourselves: is it fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 14 And does not nature itself teach you that a man, if he wears long hair, it is a dishonor to him? 15 But a woman, if she wears long hair, it is her glory, because her hair is given for a covering. 16 But if anyone is disposed to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.

1 Corinthians,"17 But in giving this instruction I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse. 18 For in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. 19 For indeed it is necessary that there be factions among you, in order that those who are approved may become evident among you. 20 Therefore, when you come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper. 21 For when you eat it, each one of you goes ahead to take his own supper, and one is hungry and another is drunk. 22 For do you not have houses for eating and drinking? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who do not have anything? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you! 23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread, 24 and after he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” 25 Likewise also the cup, after they had eaten, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” 26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. 27 So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. 28 But let a person examine himself, and in this way let him eat from the bread and let him drink from the cup. 29 For the one who eats and drinks, if he does not recognize the body, eats and drinks judgment against himself. 30 Because of this, many are weak and sick among you, and quite a few have died. 31 But if we were evaluating ourselves, we would not be judged. 32 But if we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined, in order that we will not be condemned with the world. 33 So then, my brothers, when you come together in order to eat the Lord’s supper, wait for one another. 34 If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment.

1 Corinthians,"8 For to one is given a word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another a word of knowledge by the same Spirit, 9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 10 to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing of spirits, to another kinds of tongues, to another interpretation of tongues. 11 But in all these things one and the same Spirit is at work, distributing to each one individually just as he wishes. 12 For just as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, although they are many, are one body, thus also Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free persons, and all were made to drink one Spirit. 14 For the body is not one member, but many. 15 If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,” not because of this is it not a part of the body. 16 And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body, not because of this is it not a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body just as he wanted. 19 And if they all were one member, where would the body be? 20 But now there are many members, but one body. 21 Now the eye is not able to say to the hand, “I do not have need of you,” or again, the head to the feet, “I do not have need of you.” 22 But by much more the members of the body which are thought to be weaker are necessary, 23 and the parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor, and our unpresentable parts come to have more abundant presentability, 24 but our presentable parts do not have need of this. Yet God composed the body by giving more abundant honor to the part which lacked it, 25 in order that there not be a division in the body, but the members would have the same concern for one another. 26 And if one member suffers, all the members suffer together; if a member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. 27 Now you are the body of Christ, and members of it individually, 28 and whom God has appointed in the church: first, apostles, second, prophets, third, teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, kinds of tongues. 29 Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all are workers of miracles, are they? 30 Not all have gifts of healing, do they? Not all speak with tongues, do they?

1 Corinthians,"31 But strive for the greater gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way. 1 If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a ringing brass gong or a clashing cymbal. 2 And if I have the gift of prophecy and I know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 3 And if I parcel out all my possessions, and if I hand over my body in order that I will be burned, but do not have love, it benefits me nothing. 4 Love is patient, love is kind, love is not jealous, it does not boast, it does not become conceited, 5 it does not behave dishonorably, it is not selfish, it does not become angry, it does not keep a record of wrongs, 6 it does not rejoice at unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth, 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 8 Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will pass away. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but whenever the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside the things of a child. 12 For now we see through a mirror indirectly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know completely, just as I have also been completely known. 13 And now these three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love. 1 Pursue love, and strive for spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. 2 For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, because no one understands, but by the Spirit he speaks mysteries.

1 Corinthians,"1 Pursue love, and strive for spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. 2 For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, because no one understands, but by the Spirit he speaks mysteries. 3 But the one who prophesies speaks to people edification and encouragement and consolation. 4 The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. 5 Now I want you all to speak with tongues, but even more that you may prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks with tongues, unless he interprets, in order that the church may receive edification. 6 But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, how do I benefit you, unless I speak to you either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching? 7 Likewise, the inanimate things which produce a sound, whether flute or lyre, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the lyre? 8 For indeed, if the trumpet produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare for battle? 9 And so you through the tongue, unless you produce a clear message, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air. 10 There are probably so many kinds of languages in the world, and none without meaning. 11 Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a barbarian to the one who is speaking, and the one who is speaking will be a barbarian in my judgment. 12 In this way also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek for the edification of the church, in order that you may abound. 13 Therefore the one who speaks in a tongue must pray that he may interpret. 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive. 15 Therefore what should I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will also sing praise with my mind. 16 For otherwise, if you praise in your spirit, how will the one who fills the place of the outsider say the “amen” at your thanksgiving, because he does not know what you are saying? 17 For indeed you are giving thanks well, but the other person is not edified. 18 I give thanks to God that I speak with tongues more than all of you, 19 but in the church I prefer to speak five words with my mind, in order that I may instruct other people, than ten thousand words in a tongue. 20 Brothers, do not become children in your understanding, but with respect to wickedness be as a child, and in your understanding be mature. 21 In the law it is written: “By those who speak a foreign language and by the lips of others I will speak to this people, and not even in this way will they obey me,” says the Lord. 22 So then, tongues are for a sign not to those who believe, but to unbelievers, but prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for those who believe. 23 Therefore, if the whole church comes together at the same time and all speak with tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds? 24 But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all, 25 the secret things of his heart become evident, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among you!” 26 Therefore what should you do, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. All things must be done for edification. 27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, it must be on one occasion two or at most three, and one after the other, and one must interpret. 28 But if there is no interpreter, he must be silent in the church, but let him speak to himself and to God. 29 Let two or three prophets speak, and the others evaluate. 30 And if something is revealed to another who is seated, the first must be silent. 31 For you are all able to prophesy in turn, in order that all may learn and all may be encouraged, 32 and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. 33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints, 34 the women must be silent in the churches, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but they must be in submission, just as the law also says. 35 But if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church. 36 Or has the word of God gone out from you, or has it come to you only? 37 If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, he should recognize that the things which I am writing to you are of the Lord. 38 But if anyone ignores this, he is ignored. 39 So then, my brothers, desire to prophesy, and do not prevent speaking with tongues. 40 But let all things be done decently and according to proper procedure.

If the dead are not raised at all, why indeed are they being baptized on behalf of them? 30 And why are we in danger every hour? 31 I die every day—yes indeed, by my boasting in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord! 32 If according to a human perspective I fought wild beasts at Ephesus, what benefit is it to me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. 33 Do not be deceived! “Bad company corrupts good morals.” 34 Sober up correctly and stop sinning, for some have no knowledge of God—I say this to your shame. 35 But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what sort of body do they come?” 36 Foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. 37 And what you sow is not the body which it will become, but you sow the bare seed, whether perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest. 38 But God gives to it a body just as he wishes, and to each one of the seeds its own body. 39 Not all flesh is the same, but there is one flesh of human beings, and another flesh of animals, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish, 40 and heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly bodies is of one kind, and the glory of the earthly bodies is of another kind. 41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory. 42 Thus also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility. 43 It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. 44 It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.

It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. 44 It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 45 Thus also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. 46 But the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual. 47 The first man is from the earth, made of earth; the second man is from heaven. 48 As the one who is made of earth, so also are those who are made of earth, and as the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly. 49 And just as we have borne the image of the one who is made of earth, we will also bear the image of the heavenly. 50 But I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God, nor can corruption inherit incorruptibility. 51 Behold, I tell you a mystery: we will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed, 52 in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 53 For it is necessary for this perishable body to put on incorruptibility, and this mortal body to put on immortality. 54 But whenever this perishable body puts on incorruptibility and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will take place: “Death is swallowed up in victory. 55 Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting? 56 Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ! 58 So then, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

1 Corinthians,"1 Now concerning the collection for the saints: just as I gave directions about it to the churches of Galatia, so you do also. 2 On the first day of the week, each one of you put aside something, saving up to whatever extent he has prospered, in order that whenever I come, at that time collections do not take place. 3 And whenever I arrive, whomever you approve by letters, I will send these to take your gift to Jerusalem. 4 And if it is worthwhile for me to go also, they will travel with me. 5 But I will come to you whenever I go through Macedonia (for I am going through Macedonia), 6 and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go. 7 For I do not want to see you now in passing, for I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord allows it. 8 But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost, 9 for a great and effective door has opened for me, and there are many opponents. 10 But if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to fear, for he is carrying out the Lord’s work, as I also am. 11 Therefore do not let anyone disdain him, but send him on his way in peace in order that he may come to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers. 12 Now concerning Apollos our brother, I urged him many times that he should come to you with the brothers, and he was not at all willing that he should come now, but he will come whenever he has an opportunity. 13 Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act courageously, be strong. 14 All your actions must be done in love. 15 Now I urge you, brothers—you know about the household of Stephanas, that they are the first fruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the ministry for the saints—16 that you also be subject to such people, and to all those who work together and labor. 17 Now I rejoice over the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because these make up for your absence, 18 for they have refreshed my spirit and yours.

Aquila and Prisca greet you in the Lord many times, together with the church in their house. 20 All the brothers greet you.

2 Corinthians,"4 who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in all affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. 5 For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, thus through Christ our comfort overflows also. 6 But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort that is at work in the patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer. 7 And our hope for you is firm, because we know that as you are sharers in the sufferings, so also you will be sharers in the comfort. 8 For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning our affliction that happened in the province of Asia, that we were burdened to an extraordinary degree, beyond our strength, so that we were in despair even of living. 9 But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, so that we would not be putting confidence in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead, 10 who delivered us from so great a risk of death, and will deliver us, in whom we have put our hope that he will also deliver us again, 11 while you also join in helping on our behalf by prayer, so that thanks may be given on our behalf by many persons for this gracious gift given to us through the help of many. 12 For our reason for boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, in holiness and purity of motive from God, not in merely human wisdom, but by the grace of God. 13 For we are not writing anything else to you except what you can read or also understand. But I hope that you will understand completely, 14 just as you have also understood us in part, that we are your reason for boasting, just as you are also ours in the day of our Lord Jesus. 15 And with this confidence, I was wanting to come to you previously, in order that you may have a second proof of my goodwill, 16 and through you to go to Macedonia, and to come to you again from Macedonia, and to be sent on my way by you to Judea. 17 Therefore, when I was wanting to do this, perhaps then was I making use of vacillation?

2 Corinthians,"14 But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ, and who reveals the fragrance of the knowledge of him through us in every place. 15 For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, 16 to those on the one hand an odor from death to death, and to those on the other hand a fragrance from life to life. And who is qualified for these things? 17 For we are not like the majority who peddle the word of God, but as from pure motives—but as from God—we speak before God in Christ. 1 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we, like some, need letters of recommendation to you or from you? 2 You are our letter, inscribed on our hearts, known and read by all people, 3 revealing that you are a letter of Christ, delivered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets but on tablets of human hearts. 4 Now we possess such confidence through Christ toward God. 5 Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God, 6 who also makes us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit, for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. 7 But if the ministry of death in letters carved on stone came with glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look intently into the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which was transitory, 8 how will the ministry of the Spirit not be even more with glory? 9 For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, by much more will the ministry of righteousness overflow with glory. 10 For indeed what had been glorified has not been glorified in this case, on account of the glory that surpasses it. 11 For if what was transitory came with glory, by much more what remains is with glory. 12 Therefore, because we have such a hope, we use much boldness, 13 and not as Moses used to place a veil over his face, in order that the sons of Israel would not stare at the end of what was transitory. 14 But their minds were hardened.

2 Corinthians,"10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, in order that each one may receive back the things through the body according to what he has done, whether good or bad. 11 Therefore, because we know the fear of the Lord, we are attempting to persuade people, but we are revealed to God, and I hope to be revealed in your consciences. 12 We are not commending ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to boast about us, in order that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart. 13 For if we are out of our senses, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you. 14 For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one died for all; as a result all died. 15 And he died for all, in order that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for the one who died for them and was raised.

Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? 15 And what agreement does Christ have with Beliar? Or what share does a believer have with an unbeliever? 16 And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said, “I will live in them and will walk about among them, and I will be their God and they will be my people.” 17 Therefore “come out from their midst and be separate,” says the Lord, “and do not touch what is unclean, and I will welcome you, 18 and I will be a father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to me,” says the all-powerful Lord. 1 Therefore since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of body and spirit, accomplishing holiness in the fear of God.

2 Corinthians,"1 Therefore since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of body and spirit, accomplishing holiness in the fear of God. 2 Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have ruined no one, we have defrauded no one. 3 I do not say this to condemn you, because I have already said that you are in our hearts, so that we die together and we live together. 4 Great is my confidence toward you; great is my boasting on your behalf; I am filled with encouragement; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction. 5 For even when we arrived in Macedonia, our body had no rest, but we were afflicted in every way—quarrels outside, fears within. 6 But God, who comforts the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus, 7 and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted among you, because he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more. 8 For if indeed I grieved you by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I did regret it (I see that that letter grieved you, even though for a short time), 9 now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you were grieved to repentance. For you were grieved according to the will of God, so that you suffered loss in no way through us. 10 For grief according to the will of God brings about a repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted, but worldly grief brings about death. 11 For behold how much diligence this very thing, being grieved according to the will of God, has brought about in you: what defense of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! In everything you have demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in this matter. 12 Consequently, even if I wrote to you, it was not because of the one who did wrong or because of the one who had been wronged, but in order that your diligence on our behalf might be revealed to you before God. 13 Because of this we have been encouraged, and in addition to our encouragement, we rejoiced much more over the joy of Titus, because his spirit had been refreshed by all of you. 14 For if I have boasted anything to him about you, I have not been put to shame, but as I have spoken everything to you in truth, thus also our boasting to Titus has proven to be true. 15 And his affection for you is all the more when he remembers the obedience of all of you as you welcomed him with fear and trembling. 16 I rejoice, because in everything I am completely confident in you.

2 Corinthians,"1 Now we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia, 2 that with a great ordeal of affliction, the abundance of their joy and the extreme depth of their poverty have overflowed to the wealth of their generosity. 3 I testify that they gave according to their ability, and beyond their ability, by their own choice, 4 requesting of us with much exhortation the favor and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints, 5 and not just as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, by the will of God. 6 So we urged Titus that, just as he had previously begun it, thus he would also complete for you this act of grace. 7 But just as you excel in everything—in faith and in speaking and in knowledge and with all diligence and in the love from us that is in you—so may you excel in this grace also.

2 Corinthians,"8 I am not saying this as a command, but proving the genuineness of your love by means of the diligence of others. 9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich, for your sake he became poor, in order that you, by his poverty, may become rich. 10 And I am giving an opinion in this matter, because this is profitable for you who not only began previously, a year ago, to do something, but also to want to do it. 11 So now also complete the doing of it, in order that just as you have the eagerness to want to do it, thus also you may complete it from what you have. 12 For if the eagerness is present according to what one has, it is acceptable not according to what one does not have. 13 For this is not that for others there may be relief, and for you difficult circumstances, but as a matter of equality. 14 At the present time your abundance will be for their need, in order that their abundance may also be for your need, so that there may be equality, 15 just as it is written, “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.” 16 But thanks be to God, who has put in the heart of Titus the same devotion on your behalf, 17 because he not only welcomed our request, but being very earnest, by his own choice he went out to you. 18 And we have sent at the same time with him the brother whose praise in the gospel has become known throughout all the churches. 19 And not only this, but he was also chosen by the churches as our traveling companion together with this gift that is being administered by us to the glory of the Lord himself and to show our readiness to help. 20 We are trying to avoid this, lest anyone should find fault with us in this abundant gift that is being administered by us. 21 For we are taking into consideration what is honorable not only before the Lord, but also before people. 22 And we are sending with them our brother whom we have tested many times in many things that he is diligent, but now much more diligent because of his great confidence in you. 23 If there is a question concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. If there is a question concerning our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ. 24 Therefore show to them the proof of your love and our boasting about you openly before the churches. 1 For it is unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the ministry to the saints, 2 because I know your readiness to help, concerning which I keep on boasting to the Macedonians about you, that Achaia has been ready to help since last year, and your zeal has stirred up the majority of them. 3 But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you would not prove to be empty in this case, so that you may be prepared just as I was saying, 4 lest somehow if Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to speak of you—would be humiliated in connection with this project. 5 Therefore I considered it necessary to urge the brothers that they should go on ahead to you and make arrangements in advance for your generous gift that was promised previously, so this would be prepared as a generous gift and not as grudgingly granted.

2 Corinthians,"6 Now the point is this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. 7 Each one should give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or from compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 8 And God is able to cause all grace to abound to you, so that in everything at all times, because you have enough of everything, you may overflow in every good work. 9 Just as it is written, “He scattered widely, he gave to the poor; his righteousness remains forever.” 10 Now the one who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed, and will cause the harvest of your righteousness to grow, 11 being made rich in every way for all generosity, which is producing through us thanksgiving to God, 12 because the service of this ministry is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but also is overflowing through many expressions of thanksgiving to God. 13 Through the proven character of this service they will glorify God because of the submission of your confession to the gospel of Christ and the generosity of your participation toward them and toward everyone, 14 and they are longing for you in their prayers for you, because of the surpassing grace of God to you. 15 Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift! 1 Now I, Paul, appeal to you myself by the humility and gentleness of Christ, who when I am present in person am humble among you, but when I am absent am bold toward you—2 now I ask when I am present that I will not need to be bold with the confidence with which I propose to show boldness toward some who consider us as behaving according to the flesh. 3 For although we are living in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh, 4 for the weapons of our warfare are not merely human, but powerful to God for the tearing down of fortresses, tearing down arguments ",2 Corinthians 9:6-10:4,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/2-corinthians-96104-338515/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2013-05-10_2-corinthians-96104_20130410172708.mp3

If anyone is convinced he himself is Christ’s, he should consider this concerning himself again: that just as Christ himself is, so also are we. 8 For even if I boast somewhat more about our authority that the Lord gave us for building you up and not for tearing you down, I will not be put to shame, 9 so that I do not want to appear as if I were terrifying you by my letters, 10 because it is said, “His letters are severe and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech is of no account.” 11 Let such a person consider this: that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, we will also be in actions when we are present. 12 For we do not dare to classify or to compare ourselves with some who commend themselves, but they themselves, when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, do not understand. 13 But we will not boast beyond limits, but according to the measure of the assignment that God has assigned to us as a measure to reach even as far as you. 14 For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we had not reached you, because we have reached even as far as you with the gospel of Christ, 15 not boasting beyond limits in the labors of others, but having hope that as your faith is growing to be enlarged greatly by you according to our assignment, 16 so that we may proclaim the gospel in the regions that lie beyond you, and not boast in the things accomplished in the area assigned to someone else. 17 But “the one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.” 18 For it is not the one commending himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends. 1 I wish that you would put up with me in something a little foolish—but indeed you are putting up with me. 2 For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy, because I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. 3 But I am afraid lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds may be led astray from the sincerity and the purity of devotion to Christ. 4 For if the one who comes proclaims another Jesus whom we have not proclaimed, or you receive a different spirit which you did not receive, or a different gospel which you did not accept, you put up with it well enough! 5 For I consider myself in no way to be inferior to the preeminent apostles.

Because I do not love you? God knows I do! 12 But what I am doing, I will also do, in order that I may remove the opportunity of those who want an opportunity, that they may be found just as also we are in what they are boasting about. 13 For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light. 15 Therefore it is not a great thing if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds. 16 Again I say, do not let anyone think I am foolish. But indeed, if you do, accept me even as foolish, in order that I also may boast a little. 17 What I am saying in this project of boasting, I am not saying as the Lord would say, but as in foolishness. 18 Since many are boasting according to human standards, I also will boast. 19 For because you are wise, you put up with foolish people gladly! 20 For you put up with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone takes advantage of you, if someone is presumptious toward you, if someone strikes you in the face. 21 I say this to my shame, namely, that we have been weak. But in whatever anyone dares to boast—I am speaking in foolishness—I also dare to boast. 22 Are they Hebrews? I am also! Are they Israelites? I am also! Are they descendants of Abraham? I am also! 23 Are they servants of Christ?—I am speaking as though I were beside myself—I am more so, with far greater labors, with far more imprisonments, with beatings to a much greater degree, in danger of death many times. 24 Five times I received at the hands of the Jews forty lashes less one. 25 Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I received a stoning. Three times I was shipwrecked. A day and a night I have spent in the deep water. 26 I have been on journeys many times, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own people, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers because of false brothers, 27 with toil and hardship, often in sleepless nights, with hunger and thirst, often going hungry, in cold and poorly clothed. 28 Apart from these external things, there is the pressure on me every day of the anxiety about all the churches. 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to sin, and I do not burn with indignation? 30 If it is necessary to boast, I will boast about the things related to my weakness. 31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying. 32 In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to take me into custody, 33 and I was lowered through a window through the wall in a rope-basket, and I escaped his hands.

2 Corinthians,"1 It is necessary to boast; it is not profitable, but I will proceed to visions and revelations of the Lord. 2 I know a man in Christ fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven, 3 and I know this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows—4 that he was caught up to paradise and heard words not to be spoken, which it is not permitted for a person to speak. 5 On behalf of such a person I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses. 6 For if I want to boast, I will not be foolish, because I will be telling the truth, but I am refraining, so that no one can credit to me more than what he sees in me or hears anything from me, 7 even because of the extraordinary degree of the revelations. Therefore, so that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan, in order that it would torment me so that I would not exalt myself. 8 Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would depart from me. 9 And he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, because the power is perfected in weakness.” Therefore rather I will boast most gladly in my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may reside in me. 10 Therefore I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in calamities, in persecutions and difficulties for the sake of Christ, for whenever I am weak, then I am strong. 11 I have become a fool! You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for I am in no way inferior to the preeminent apostles, even if I am nothing. 12 Indeed, the signs of an apostle have been done among you with all patient endurance, both signs and wonders and deeds of power. 13 For in what respect are you made worse off more than the rest of the churches, except that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong! 14 Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you. For I am not seeking your possessions, but you. For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. 15 But I will spend and be expended most gladly for your lives.

Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same footsteps? 19 Have you been thinking all this time that we are defending ourselves to you? We are speaking in Christ before God, and all these things, dear friends, are for your edification. 20 For I am afraid lest somehow when I arrive, I will not find you as I want, and I may be found by you as you do not want. I am afraid lest somehow there will be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, pride, disorder. 21 I am afraid lest when I come again my God will humiliate me in your presence, and I will grieve over many of those who sinned previously and have not repented because of their impurity and sexual immorality and licentiousness that they have practiced. 1 This is the third time I am coming to you. By the testimony of two or three witnesses every word will be established. 2 I have already said when I was present the second time, and although I am absent now I also say in advance to those who sinned previously and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare anyone, 3 since you are demanding proof that Christ, who is not weak toward you, but is powerful among you, is speaking in me. 4 For indeed, he was crucified because of weakness, but he lives because of the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will live together with him because of the power of God toward you. 5 Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize regarding yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are unqualified? 6 And I hope that you will recognize that we are not unqualified! 7 Now we pray to God that you not do wrong in any way, not that we are seen as approved, but that you do what is good, even though we are seen as though unqualified. 8 For we are not able to do anything against the truth, but rather only for the truth. 9 For we rejoice whenever we are weak, but you are strong, and we pray for this: your maturity. 10 Because of this, I am writing these things although I am absent, in order that when I am present I may not have to act severely according to the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down. 11 Finally, brothers, rejoice, be restored, be encouraged, be in agreement, be at peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you. 12 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you. 13 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.

And Judah was taken away to Babylon on account of their sin. 2 Now the first inhabitants who were settled on their property in their cities in Israel were the priests, the Levites, and the temple servants. 3 And some of the people of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh lived in Jerusalem: 4 Uthai the son of Ammihud, son of Omri, son of Imri, son of Bani, from the sons of Perez, the son of Judah. 5 And from the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn and his sons. 6 And from the sons of Zerah: Jeuel and their brethren, six hundred and ninety. 7 And from the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah; 8 Ibneah the son of Jeroham; Elah the son of Uzzi, son of Michri; Meshullam the son of Shephatiah, son of Reuel, son of Ibnijah; 9 and their brethren according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty-six. All these men were the heads of the families in the house of their fathers. 10 And from the priests: Jedaiah; Jehoiarib; Jakin; 11 Azariah son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son of Zadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, the commander of the house of God; 12 Adaiah son of Jeroham, son of Pashhur, son of Malkijah; Maasai the son of Adiel, son of Jahzerah, son of Meshullam, son of Meshillemith, son of Immer; 13 and their kinsmen, heads of the house of their fathers, one thousand seven hundred and sixty mighty men for the work of the service of the house of God. 14 And from the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, from the sons of Merari; 15 Bakbakkar; Heresh; Galal; Mattaniah the son of Mica, son of Zicri, son of Asaph; 16 Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun; and Berechiah the son of Asa, son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of Netophathite. 17 And the gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brethren (Shallum was the chief); 18 until then they were gatekeepers at the gate of the king on the east side toward the camps of the Levites. 19 And Shallum the son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his kinsmen of the house of his fathers, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, the guardians of the entrances to the tent, and their fathers were over the camp of Yahweh, guardians of the entrance. 20 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the leader over them in time past; Yahweh was with him. 21 Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the doorway to the tent of assembly. 22 All of them were chosen as gatekeepers at the entrances, two hundred and twelve. They were enrolled by genealogies in their villages. They were established by David and Samuel the seer on account of their faithfulness. 23 So they and their sons were over the gates of the house of Yahweh at the house of the tent as guards. 24 The gatekeepers were on four sides: east, west, north, and south. 25 And their brethren in their villages were to come every seven days by turn to be with these. 26 For the four mighty gatekeepers, they who were Levites, were entrusted and were over the chambers and over the storerooms of the house of God. 27 And they lodged all around the house of God, for upon them was a responsibility. And they had charge of opening the house of God every morning. 28 And some of them were over the utensils of the service, for they count them when they are brought in and they count them when they are brought out. 29 And some of them were appointed over the objects, over all the objects of the sanctuary, and over the wheat flour and the wine, the olive oil, the frankincense, and the spices. 30 And some of the sons of the priests mixed the fragrant ointment for the spices. 31 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite and was entrusted with the work of the pan breads. 32 And from the sons of the Kohathites, some of their kinsmen were over the showbread to prepare it every Sabbath. 33 Now these were the singers; the heads of the families of the Levites were in the chambers free from other service, for day and night they were over them on the service. 34 These were the heads of the families of the Levites according to their genealogies, leaders. These lived in Jerusalem. 35 And these lived in Gibeon: Jeiel the father of Gibeon. And the name of his wife was Maacah. 36 And his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, 37 Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. 38 And Mikloth fathered Shimeam. And they also lived nearby their brothers in Jerusalem with their brothers. 39 And Ner fathered Kish, and Kish fathered Saul, and Saul fathered Jonathan, Malchi-Shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal. 40 And the son of Jonathan was Meribaal. And Meribaal fathered Micah. 41 And the sons of Micah were Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz. 42 And Ahaz fathered Jarah, and Jarah fathered Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri. And Zimri fathered Moza, 43 and Moza fathered Binea; and Rephaiah was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. 44 And Azel had six sons, and these are their names: Azrikam, Bokeru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel. 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and every Israelite fled away from before the Philistines. And they fell slain upon Mount Gilboa. 2 And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua, the sons of Saul. 3 And the battle was heavy against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers. 4 And Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and deal harshly with me.” But his armor-bearer was not willing, because he was very afraid. Then Saul took the sword and fell upon it. 5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon the sword, and he died. 6 So Saul died. And his three sons and all his house died together. 7 And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. Then the Philistines came and dwelled in them. 8 And it happened that on the next day when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 9 And they stripped him and took his head and his weapons, and they sent them throughout the land of the Philistines to bring news to their idols and the nation. 10 And they put his weapons in the temple of their gods, and they fastened his skull to the temple of Dagon. 11 When all Jabesh-Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 12 every strong man arose and took the dead body of Saul and the dead bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days. 13 So Saul died on account of his sin which he had sinned against Yahweh concerning the command of Yahweh that he did not keep. He also consulted a medium to seek guidance. 14 But he did not seek Yahweh. So Yahweh put him to death and turned over the kingship to David, the son of Jesse.

1 Chronicles,"1 Then all Israel gathered to David in Hebron, saying, “Look—we are your flesh and bones. 2 For some time now, even when Saul was king, you were the one who led the army of Israel in battle. And Yahweh your God said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel and will be leader over my people Israel.’ ” 3 Then all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron in the presence of Yahweh. And they anointed David as king over Israel according to the word of Yahweh by the hand of Samuel. 4 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is Jebus). And the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there. 5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not enter here.” But David captured the stronghold of Zion; that is, the city of David. 6 Then David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first will be chief and commander.” And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first and became chief. 7 And David lived in the fortress. Therefore they called it the city of David. 8 And he built the city all around from the Millo and up to the circuit. And Joab restored the remainder of the city. 9 And David became greater and greater. And Yahweh of hosts was with him. 10 Now these are the chiefs of the mighty men who were for David, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel to make him king according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel. 11 And this is the numbering of the mighty warriors who were for David: Jashobeam son of Hachmoni was chief of the three. He himself raised his spear against three hundred whom he killed on one occasion. 12 And after him was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite. He was among the three mighty warriors. 13 He himself was with David at Pas-Dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for the battle. And there was a plot of the field filled with barley, and the people fled before the Philistines. 14 But they took their stand in the middle of the plot and defended it. And they killed the Philistines. And Yahweh saved them with a great victory. 15 And three of the thirty chiefs went down toward the rock to David at the cave of Adullam when the army of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 16 And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. 17 And David had a craving, and he said, “Who could give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!” 18 Then the three broke through into the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and brought it and came to David. But David would not drink it and poured it out before Yahweh. 19 And he said, “Far be it from me that I would do this before my God. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.” And he was not willing to drink it. These things the three mighty men did. 20 Now Abishai the brother of Joab was himself the head of the three. And he roused himself with his spear against three hundred whom he killed and made a name for himself among the three. 21 He was twice as renowned among the three and was their commander. But he did not attain to the three. 22 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a strong man from Kabzeel, one who did great deeds. He himself struck down two sons of Ariel of Moab. And he himself went down and struck down a lion within a pit on a snowy day. 23 And he himself struck down an Egyptian man, a large man five cubits tall. And in the hand of the Egyptian was a spear like a weaver’s beam. But he went down to him with a club and seized the spear from the hand of the Egyptian and killed him with his own spear. 24 These things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did and had a name among the three mighty warriors. 25 He himself was certainly distinguished among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David appointed him over his bodyguard. 26 Now the mighty warriors of the troops were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo from Bethlehem, 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, 29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, 31 Ittai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the people of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 32 Hurai of the valleys of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jehonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite, 35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 36 Hepher the Mekerathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naari the son of Ezbai, 38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, 39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the bearer of the weapons of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a leader of the Reubenites, and thirty with him, 43 Hanan the son of Maacah, Jehoshaphat the Mithnite, 44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, 45 Jediael the son of Shimri and Joha his brother the Tizite, 46 Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite, 47 Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite. 1 Now these are the ones who came to David at Ziklag while he was still shut up because of Saul, the son of Kish. And they were the mighty warriors helping with the war. 2 They were armed with the bow, able to shoot right-handed or left-handed, slinging stones or shooting arrows with the bow; they were kinsmen of Saul from Benjamin. 3 The leader was Ahiezer, then Jehoash, sons of Shemaah the Gibeonite; Jeiel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite; 4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty warrior among the thirty who was over the thirty; Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan; Jozabad the Gederathite; 5 Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Hariphite; 6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam the Korahites; 7 Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham from the Gedor. 8 And from the Gadites, valiant mighty warriors, soldiers fit for war, expert with shield and spear, defected to David at the fortress toward the wilderness. And they had faces like lions and were swift as gazelles upon the mountains. 9 Ezer the chief, Obadiah second, Eliab third, 10 Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth, 11 Attai sixth, Eliel seventh, 12 Jehonan eighth, Elzabad ninth, 13 Jeremiah tenth, Macbannai eleventh. 14 These were the sons of Gad, leaders of the army. The smallest one was as a hundred, and the greatest as a thousand. 15 These were they who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was filled over all its banks. And they put to flight all who were in the valley to the east and to the west. 16 And some of the sons of Benjamin and from Judah came to the fortress, to David. 17 And David went out to meet them and answered and said to them, “If you come in peace to me, to help me, my heart will be joined with you, but if you come to betray me to my adversaries, although there is no wrong on my hands, may the God of our fathers see and pass judgment.” 18 Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the thirty who said: “We are yours, O David! And we are with you, O son of Jesse! Peace! Peace to you, and peace to those who help you, for your God helps you.” So David appointed them as heads of the troops. 19 And some Manassites deserted to David when he came with the Philistines to the battle against Saul, but he did not help them, for the rulers of the Philistines sent him away upon counsel, saying, “He will desert to his master Saul at the cost of our heads.” 20 When he went to Ziklag some Manassites deserted to him: Adnah, Jehozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, heads of the thousands that were for Manasseh. 21 And they themselves helped David against the troops, for all of them were mighty men of strength and were commanders in the army. 22 Day in and day out they came to David to help him until there was a great army, like the army of God. 23 And these are the numbers of the chiefs of those prepared for the army who came to David at Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him according to the word of Yahweh. 24 The sons of Judah bearing shield and spear: six thousand eight hundred armed troops. 25 From the men of Simeon, mighty warriors of strength for war: seven thousand one hundred. 26 From the Levites: four thousand six hundred. 27 Jehoiada the chief officer of the house of Aaron, and with him, three thousand seven hundred. 28 And Zadok, a young man, a mighty warrior of strength, and the house of his father: twenty-two commanders. 29 From the men of Benjamin, kinsmen of Saul, three thousand, and even still the majority of them remained loyal to the house of Saul. 30 And from the men of Ephraim: twenty thousand eight hundred mighty warriors of strength, famous men in the house of their fathers. 31 And from the half-tribe of Manasseh: eighteen thousand who were designated by name to come to make David king. 32 And from the men of Issachar: men who were skilled in understanding the times to know what Israel should do. Their chiefs were two hundred, and all their kinsmen were under their command. 33 From Zebulun, those who went out armed, equipped for battle with all the weapons of war: fifty thousand to help David with singleness of purpose. 34 From Naphtali: one thousand commanders; and those with them with shield and spear: thirty-seven thousand. 35 From the Danites, those equipped for battle: twenty-eight thousand six hundred. 36 And from Asher, those who went out armed and prepared for battle: forty thousand. 37 And from beyond the Jordan, from the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all their weapons of war for battle: one hundred and twenty thousand. 38 All these were men of war arrayed in battle line with a whole heart. They came to Hebron to make David king over all Israel. Likewise, all the rest of Israel had one heart to make David king. 39 And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their kinsmen were prepared for them. 40 And also their relatives, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought food on donkeys, on camels, on mules, and on oxen—provisions of flour, cakes of figs, raisin cakes, wine and oil, cattle and sheep in abundance, for there was great joy in Israel.

1 Chronicles,"1 And it happened that after David struck the Philistines and subdued them, he captured Gath and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines. 2 And he struck Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David, bearing tribute. 3 And David struck Hadadezer, king of Zobah-Hamath, as he went to set up his monument at the Euphrates River. 4 And David captured from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. And David hamstrung all the chariot horses but left one hundred of them to remain for chariots. 5 And when the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah-Hamath, David struck down twenty-two thousand men of Aram. 6 Then David set up garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to David, bearing tribute. And Yahweh delivered David wherever he went. 7 And David took small round shields of gold that were upon the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 8 And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David captured very much bronze. Solomon made the bronze sea with it along with the columns and objects of bronze. 9 And when Tou the king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadadezer the king of Zobah, 10 he sent Hadoram his son to King David to ask him for peace and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, for Tou had been at war with Hadadezer. And he brought with him all the objects of gold, silver, and bronze. 11 King David dedicated these also to Yahweh, along with the silver and gold that he had taken from all the nations, from Edom, Moab, the sons of Ammon, the Philistines, and Amalek. 12 And Abishai son of Zeruiah defeated eighteen thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt. 13 And he put garrisons in Edom, and all Edom became servants to David. And Yahweh delivered David wherever he went. 14 So David reigned over all Israel, and he administered justice and righteousness to all his people. 15 And Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder. 16 And Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were priests, and Shavsha was secretary. 17 And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites. And the sons of David were chief officials under the hand of the king. 1 And it happened that after this Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his place. 2 And David said, “I will deal kindly with Hanun the son of Nahash because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And the servants of David came to the land of the Ammonites, to Hanun, to comfort him. 3 But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Do you think because David sent comforters to you that David honors your father? Is it not for the purpose of exploring so as to overthrow and spy out the land that his servants have come to you?” 4 So Hanun took the servants of David and shaved them and cut off their garments at the middle, up to the buttocks, and sent them away. 5 And they went and told David concerning the men, and he inquired of them, for the men were very disgraced. And the king said, “Dwell in Jericho until your beards grow out; then return.” 6 And when the Ammonites saw that they made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent one thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves horses and chariots from Aram-Naharaim, Aram-Maacah, and Zobah. 7 And they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah and his people, and they came and encamped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were gathered from their cities and came to the battle. 8 And when David heard, he sent Joab and the entire army of mighty warriors. 9 And the Ammonites went out and took up positions for battle at the entrance of the city. And the kings who had come were alone in the field. 10 When Joab saw that there was a battle line against him at the front and the back, he chose from among the chosen men in Israel and arranged them to meet Aram. 11 And the remainder of the people he put in the hand of Abishai his brother, and they were arranged to meet the Ammonites. 12 And he said, “If Aram is too strong for me, then you must be a help to me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you. 13 Be strong! Let us strengthen ourselves on behalf of our people and on behalf of the cities of our God. And may Yahweh do what is good in his eyes.” 14 And Joab and the people who were with him drew near before Aram for battle, and they fled before him. 15 And when the Ammonites saw that Aram had fled, they also fled before Abishai his brother, and they came to the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. 16 And when Aram saw that they were defeated before Israel, they sent messengers and brought out Aram, who was from beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer before them. 17 And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan. And he came to them and was arrayed against them. Then David was arrayed to meet Aram in battle, and they fought with him. 18 And Aram fled before Israel. And David killed from Aram the men of seven thousand chariots and forty thousand foot soldiers, and he put to death Shophach the commander of the army. 19 And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David and became servants to him. So Aram was no longer willing to help the Ammonites.

1 Kings,"1 Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him as king in place of his father, for Hiram had always been a friend for David. 2 Then Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 3 “You knew David my father, that he was not able to build a house for the name of Yahweh his God, in view of the warfare which surrounded him, until Yahweh placed them under the soles of his feet. 4 But now Yahweh my God has given me rest all around me. There is no adversary, and there is no bad occurrence. 5 Here I am, intending to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, as Yahweh promised to my father David, saying, ‘Your son, whom I will set in your place on your throne, shall build the house for my name.’ 6 So then, command that they may cut cedars for me from Lebanon, and let my servants be with your servants. The wage of your servants I will give to you according to all that you say, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.” 7 When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and he said, “Blessed be Yahweh this day, who has given to David a wise son over this great people.” 8 Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard what you have sent to me; I will do all of your desire concerning the timber of cedars and concerning the timber of cypresses. 9 My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them into rafts in the sea to float to the place which you indicated to me. Then I shall break them up there, and you may carry them further, and you shall meet my needs by giving food for my house.” 10 So Hiram was giving to Solomon the cedar timbers and the cypress timbers, everything he needed. 11 Then Solomon gave to Hiram twenty thousand dry measures of wheat as food for his household, and twenty dry measures of specially prepared olive oil; thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year. 12 Yahweh gave wisdom to Solomon as he promised to him, and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a covenant. 13 Then King Solomon conscripted a forced labor from all Israel, and the forced labor numbered thirty thousand men. 14 He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand every month; the work groups were a month in Lebanon and two months at home; now Adoniram was over the forced labor. 15 Solomon had seventy thousand common laborers and eighty thousand stone craftsmen in the hill country. 16 Besides the chiefs of the officers Solomon had, there were three thousand three hundred having charge over the people who were doing the work. 17 When the king commanded, they quarried great stones and precious stones to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stones. 18 So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites hewed stones, and they prepared the timber and the stone to build the house. 1 It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites went out from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s rule over Israel, the month of Ziv (that is the second month), that he began to build the house for Yahweh. 2 Now the house that King Solomon built for Yahweh was sixty cubits in its length and twenty cubits in its width and thirty cubits in its height. 3 The vestibule on the face of the main hall of the temple was twenty cubits in its length, and the width of the temple was ten cubits wide on the face of the temple. 4 And he made for the temple specially designed framed windows, 5 and he built a structure against the wall of the temple running all along the walls of the house, for the outer sanctuary and for the inner sanctuary, and made side rooms all around. 6 The lower structure was five cubits in its width and the middle was six cubits in its width and the third was seven cubits in its width, for he made niches for the temple all around to the outside, so that beams would not attach to the walls of the temple. 7 Now while the temple was being built, it was built with stones finished at the quarry, so that no hammer or stone shaping tool or any instrument of iron was heard in the temple as it was being built. 8 The doorway of the side room in the middle of the side of the temple was on the south; they went up with a stairway to the middle and from the middle to the third floor. 9 So he built the house and finished it. He covered the temple with rafters and wood planks and with the cedars. 10 He also built the structure against all of the temple five cubits in height and fastened it to the temple with beams of cedar. 11 Then the word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying, 12 “Regarding this temple that you are building: if you walk in my ordinances and if you do my judgments and you keep all my commandments to walk in them, then I will establish my promise with you which I made to David your father. 13 And I will dwell among the Israelites, and I will not forsake my people Israel.” 14 So Solomon built the temple and finished it. 15 He lined the walls of the inside of the house with boards of cedar; from the floor of the temple up to the rafters of the ceiling he covered them with wood on the inside. He also covered the floor of the temple with cypress boards. 16 He built twenty cubits from the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor up to the ceiling, and he built for it an inner sanctuary on the inside, as the most holy place. 17 The main hall of the temple was forty cubits in front of the inner sanctuary, 18 with the cedar within the inner house having carvings of gourds and buds of flowers. It was entirely of cedar; there was not a stone visible. 19 Now in the inner sanctuary in the middle of the temple he prepared the inside to place the ark of the covenant of Yahweh there. 20 In front, the inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide and twenty cubits high, and he overlaid it with pure gold and covered the altar with cedar. 21 Solomon overlaid the temple on the inside with pure gold, and he drew across it with golden chains in front of the inner sanctuary, which he overlaid with gold. 22 All of the temple he overlaid with gold until all of the temple was finished; all of the altar which belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold. 23 He made two cherubim of olive wood for the inner sanctuary, ten cubits high. 24 Five cubits was the first wing of the cherub, and five cubits the second wing of the cherub; ten cubits from the tip of his one wing up to the tip of his other wing. 25 The second cherub was ten cubits according to the same measurement, and there was one shape for the two cherubim. 26 The height of the first cherub was ten cubits and so was the second cherub. 27 He placed the cherubim in the middle of the inner house, and they spread out the wings of the cherubim; the wing of the first cherub touched against the wall and the wing of the second cherub was touching against the second wall; their wings spread to the middle of the house and were touching wing to wing. 28 He also overlaid the cherubim with gold. 29 On all of the walls around the house, he carved engravings of cherubim and palm tree images and budding flowers both inside and out. 30 He overlaid the floor of the house with gold both inside and out. 31 He made doors of olive wood for the doorway of the inner sanctuary, as well as for the doorpost of the fifth doorframe. 32 On the two doors of olive wood he made carvings of cherubim and palm tree images and budding flowers, and he overlaid them with gold by beating out the gold on the cherubim and the palm tree images. 33 Thus he made doorframes of olive wood on four sides for the doorway of the main hall 34 and two doors of cypress wood; one door with two folding panels and the second door with two folding panels. 35 He carved cherubim and palm tree images and budding flowers and overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work. 36 Then he built the inner courtyard with three rows of dressed stone and a row of cedar beams. 37 In the fourth year, the house of Yahweh was founded in the month of Ziv. 38 In the eleventh year in the month of Bul, that is, the eighth month, the house was finished according to all his specifications and according to all his plans. He had built it in seven years.

1 Kings,"1 Suddenly a man of God from Judah came to Bethel, by the word of Yahweh, while Jeroboam was standing at the altar to offer incense. 2 Then he proclaimed against the altar by the word of Yahweh and said, “O altar, altar, thus says Yahweh: ‘Look, a son will be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones shall burn on you.’ ” 3 He gave a sign on that day, saying, “This is the sign that Yahweh has predetermined: Look, this altar will be torn apart, and the ashes that are on it will be poured out.” 4 It happened at the moment the king heard the word of the man of God that he cried out against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” But his hand which he stretched out to him was paralyzed, and he was not able to draw it back to himself. 5 Then the altar was torn apart and the ashes from the altar poured out according to the sign which the man of God had announced by the word of Yahweh. 6 Then the king responded and said to the man of God, “Please entreat the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me that my hand may return to me.” So the man of God entreated the face of Yahweh, and the hand of the king returned to him, as it was in the beginning. 7 Then the king spoke to the man of God, “Come with me to the house and refresh yourself, that I may give you a gift.” 8 Then the man of God said to the king, “Even if you give to me half of your house I will not come with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water in this place, 9 for the word of Yahweh has commanded me, saying, ‘You shall not eat bread nor drink water, and you shall not return on the way that you came.’ ” 10 So he went another way, and he did not return by the way on which he had come to Bethel. 11 Now a certain older prophet was living in Bethel, and his son came and recounted to him all of the things that the man of God had done that day in Bethel and the words he had spoken to the king, and they told them to their father. 12 Then their father asked them, “Which way did he go?” His sons had seen the way which the man of God who had come from Judah had taken. 13 Then he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it 14 and went after the man of God. He found him sitting under the oak and said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” He said, “I am.” 15 Then he said to him, “Come with me to the house and eat some food.” 16 Then he said, “I am not able to return with you or to go with you. I will not eat food nor will I drink water with you in this place. 17 For a word came to me by the word of Yahweh, ‘You shall not eat food, nor shall you drink water there. You shall not return to go by the way that you came.’ ” 18 Then he said, “I am also a prophet like you. An angel spoke to me by the word of Yahweh, saying, ‘Let him return with you to your house that he may eat food and drink water.’ ” He lied to him. 19 So he returned with him and ate food in his house and drank water. 20 Now it happened that they were sitting at the table, and the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back. 21 He proclaimed to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Because you have disobeyed the word of Yahweh and have not kept the command which Yahweh your God commanded you, 22 but you have returned and have eaten food and drank water in the place which he ordered you not to eat food nor to drink water, then your dead body shall not return to the tomb of your ancestors.’ ” 23 It happened after he ate food and drank water that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back. 24 When he left, a lion found him on the road and killed him, and his dead body was thrown on the road with the donkey standing beside it, and the lion was standing by the dead body. 25 As men were passing by and they saw the dead body thrown in the road and the lion standing beside the dead body, they came and told it in the city where the old prophet was living. 26 When the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard, he said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the mouth of Yahweh, and Yahweh has given him to the lion. He tore him in pieces and killed him according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken to him.” 27 Then he spoke to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled it. 28 He went and found his dead body thrown in the road and a donkey with the lion standing beside it, but the lion had not eaten the corpse nor attacked the donkey. 29 So the prophet lifted up the corpse of the man of God and put it on the donkey and brought it back. He came to the city of the old prophet to mourn him and to bury him. 30 He put his corpse in his tomb, and they mourned over him, “Alas, my brother!” 31 It happened after he buried him that he said to his sons, “When I die, you shall bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried; you shall lay my bones beside his bones. 32 For surely, the thing which he proclaimed by the word of Yahweh against the altar which is in Bethel will happen, as it will against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria.” 33 After this event, Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but he returned and again made priests for the high places of people from all walks of life. He filled his hand with all his desire and became one of the priests of the high places himself. 34 This matter became sin in the house of Jeroboam, to make it disappear and to destroy it from the surface of the earth. 1 At that time, Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill. 2 Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please get up and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Look, Ahijah the prophet is there, and he spoke concerning me before I became king over this people. 3 You must take ten loaves of bread in your hand and cakes and a jar of honey, and you must go to him. He shall tell you what will happen to the boy.” 4 The wife of Jeroboam did so. She got up, went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah was not able to see, for his eyes were fixed because of his old age. 5 Then Yahweh said to Ahijah, “Look, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to seek a word from you about her son, for he is ill. Thus and so you shall say to her. When she comes, she will be disguising herself.” 6 It happened at the moment Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps coming through the doorway, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why are you making yourself unrecognizable? I have been sent a hard message for you: 7 Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: “Because I raised you from the midst of the people and I made you leader over my people Israel, 8 I tore the kingdom from the house of David and I gave it to you. But you were not like my servant David who kept my commandments, and who went after me with all his heart, to do only what is right in my eyes. 9 But you did more evil than all who were before you. You have gone and made for yourself other gods and molten idols to provoke me, but me you have completely disregarded. 10 Therefore, look, I am about to bring disaster upon the house of Jeroboam, and I will cut off males from Jeroboam, bond or free, in Israel. I will burn after the house of Jeroboam as one burns after the manure, until it is finished. 11 The one belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city, the dogs will eat. The one who dies in the open field, the birds of the heavens will eat, for Yahweh has spoken it.” ’ 12 As for you, get up. Go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child will die. 13 All of Israel will mourn for him, and they will bury him. This one alone will come to a tomb for Jeroboam, because a good thing has been found in him by Yahweh the God of Israel in the house of Israel. 14 Yahweh will raise up a king for himself over Israel who will even now cut off the house of Jeroboam this day. 15 Yahweh will strike Israel as one shakes the reed plant in the water, and he will root Israel up from this good land that he gave to their ancestors. He will scatter them beyond the River because they have made their sacred poles which are provoking Yahweh. 16 He will give up Israel because of the sin of Jeroboam which he sinned and which he caused Israel to sin.” 17 Then the wife of Jeroboam got up, went, and came to Tirzah. As she was coming to the threshold of the house, the boy died. 18 They buried him and all of Israel mourned for him, according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet. 19 The remainder of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel. 20 The days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years, and he slept with his ancestors. Then Nadab his son became king in place of him. 21 Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which, from all of the tribes of Israel, Yahweh chose to place his name. And the name of his mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. 22 But Judah did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and they annoyed him more than their fathers did with their sins that they had committed. 23 They also built for themselves high places and stone pillars and sacred poles on every high hill and under every green tree. 24 There were also male shrine prostitutes in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh had driven out from before the Israelites. 25 It happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, 26 and he took the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and he took all the treasures of the king’s house. He took the small gold shields that Solomon had made, 27 so King Rehoboam made small copper shields in place of them and entrusted them to the commanders of the royal guard who keep the doorway of the king’s house. 28 Whenever the king came to the house of Yahweh, the royal guard carried them and brought them back to the alcove room of the royal guard. 29 The remainder of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 30 There was always war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. 31 Then Rehoboam slept with his ancestors, and he was buried with his ancestors in the city of David. The name of his mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam his son became king in his place.

1 Kings,"30 But Ahab son of Omri did evil in the eyes of Yahweh more than all who were before him. 31 If it wasn’t enough that he went after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he also took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal the king of the Sidonians. He went and served Baal and bowed down to him. 32 And he built an altar to Baal in the house of Baal which he had built in Samaria. 33 Ahab also made the sacred pole, and he continued to provoke Yahweh the God of Israel more than all the kings of Israel who were before him. 34 In his days, Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho; at the cost of Abiram his firstborn he laid its foundation, and at the cost of Segub his younger sibling, he set up its gates, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of Joshua the son of Nun. 1 Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead said to Ahab, “As Yahweh lives, the God of Israel before whom I stand, there shall surely not be dew nor rain these years except by my command.” 2 Then the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 3 “Go from this place and turn to the east; you must hide yourself in the Wadi Kerith which faces the Jordan. 4 It shall be that you shall drink from the wadi, and I have commanded the crows to sustain you there.” 5 So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh. He went and stayed in the Wadi Kerith which faces the Jordan. 6 The crows were bringing bread and meat in the morning for him and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the wadi. 7 It happened after a while that the wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land. 8 Then the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 9 “Get up and go to Zarephath which belongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman there, a widow, to sustain you.” 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath and came to the gate of the city. There was a widow woman gathering wood, so he called to her, and he said, “Please bring a little water for me in a vessel so that I can drink.” 11 She went to fetch it, and he called to her and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” 12 She said, “As Yahweh your God lives, surely I do not have a cake, but only a handful of flour in the jar and a little olive oil in the jug. Here I am gathering a few pieces of wood, and I will go and prepare it for me and my son, that we might eat it and die.” 13 Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do according to your word; only make for me a small bread cake from it first, and bring it out to me. Make it for yourself and for your son afterward. 14 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘The jar of flour will not be emptied and the jug of olive oil will not run out until the day Yahweh gives rain on the surface of the earth.’ ” 15 So she went and did according to the word of Elijah; then both she and he ate with her household for many days. 16 The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive oil did not run out, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of Elijah. 17 It happened after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill; and his illness was very severe until there was no breath left in him. 18 She said to Elijah, “What do you have against me, O man of God, that you have come to me to make known my guilt and to cause my son to die?” 19 Then he said to her, “Give me your son.” He took him from her lap and carried him up to the upper room where he was staying, and he laid him on his bed. 20 Then he called to Yahweh and said, “O Yahweh my God, are you also causing evil to come upon the widow with whom I am dwelling as an alien by causing her son to die?” 21 He stretched himself out on the child three times and called to Yahweh and said, “O Yahweh my God, please let the life of this child return within him.” 22 Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah, and the life of the child returned within him, and he lived. 23 Elijah then took the child and brought him down from the upper room to the house and gave him to his mother. Elijah said, “Look, your son is alive.” 24 Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now this I know, that you are a man of God and the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth.” 1 It happened many days later that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah in the third year, saying, “Go, present yourself to Ahab so that I may give rain on the surface of the earth.” 2 So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. 3 Ahab summoned Obadiah who was over the house. (Now Obadiah was fearing Yahweh greatly. 4 It had happened that when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in the cave and sustained them with food and water.) 5 Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the wadis. Perhaps we may find green grass that we may keep horses and mules alive and that we might not lose any of the animals.” 6 So they divided the land for themselves in order to pass through it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. 7 It happened that Obadiah was on the way, and suddenly Elijah was there to meet him. When he recognized him, he fell on his face and said, “Is this you, my lord Elijah?” 8 He said to him, “I am. Go, say to your lord, ‘Elijah is here.’ ” 9 He said, “How have I sinned that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab to kill me? 10 As Yahweh your God lives, surely there is not a nation or a kingdom to which my lord has not sent me to seek you. If they would say, ‘He is not here,’ then he would make the kingdom or the nation swear that it could not find you. 11 Now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your lord: “Elijah is here.” ’ 12 And it will happen that I will go from you and the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you up to where I do not know. Then I will come to tell Ahab, but he will not find you, and then he will kill me, even though your servant has feared Yahweh from my youth. 13 Has it not been told to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh? I hid a hundred men of the prophets of Yahweh by fifties in the cave, and I sustained them with food and water. 14 Now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your lord: “Elijah is here,” ’ and he will kill me.” 15 Elijah said, “As Yahweh of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will certainly show myself to him today.” 16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and he told him, so Ahab went to meet Elijah. 17 When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is this you who throws Israel into confusion?” ",1 Kings 16:30-1 Kings 18:17,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-kings-16301817-303815/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-10-17_1-kings-16301817_20121003150058.mp3
1 Kings,"1 Then Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. 2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “Thus may the gods do to me, and may they add to it, surely at this time tomorrow I will make your life as the life of one of them!” 3 Then he became afraid, got up, and fled for his life. He came to Beersheba which belongs to Judah, and he left his servant there. 4 Then he went into the wilderness one day’s journey, and he went and sat under a certain broom tree. Then he asked Yahweh that he might die, and he said, “It is enough now, Yahweh; take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors.” 5 He lay down and fell asleep under a certain broom tree, and suddenly this angel was touching him and said to him, “Get up, eat!” 6 He looked, and behold, a bread cake on hot coals was near his head and a jar of water, so he ate and drank. Then he did it again and lay down. 7 The angel of Yahweh appeared a second time and touched him and said, “Get up, eat, for the journey is greater than you.” 8 So he got up, ate, drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights up to Horeb, the mountain of God. 9 He came to the cave there and spent the night there. Suddenly the word of Yahweh came to him and asked him, “Elijah, what are you doing here?” 10 Then he said, “I have been very zealous for Yahweh the God of hosts, for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant. They have demolished your altars, and they have killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left over, and they seek to take my life. 11 He said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before Yahweh.” Suddenly Yahweh was passing by, with a great and strong wind ripping the mountains and crushing rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh was not in the wind. After the wind, there was an earthquake; but Yahweh was not in the earthquake. 12 After the earthquake was a fire, but Yahweh was not in the fire. After the fire there was the sound of a gentle whisper. 13 It happened at the moment Elijah heard, he covered his face with his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Suddenly a voice came to him and said, “Elijah, why are you here?” 14 He said, “I have been very zealous for Yahweh the God of Hosts, for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, demolished your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword; I alone am left, and they seek to take my life!” 15 Then Yahweh said to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. Go and anoint Hazael as king over Aram; 16 and Jehu son of Nimshi you shall anoint as king over Israel. You shall also anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-Meholah as prophet in your place. 17 It shall be that the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall kill. 18 I will leave in Israel seven thousand, all of the knees that have not bowed down to Baal and all of the mouths that have not kissed him.” 19 So he went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat while he was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen before him. When he and the twelve passed Elijah, he threw his cloak on him. 20 Then he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, “Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will go after you.” Then he said, “Go, return, for what I have done to you?” 21 So he returned from after him, and he took a pair of oxen and slaughtered them, and with the yoke of the oxen he boiled the flesh and gave it to the people and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and served him. 1 Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathered all of his army, and thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots. He went up and laid siege against Samaria and fought with it. 2 He sent messengers to the city to Ahab king of Israel. 3 He said to him, “Thus says Ben-Hadad: ‘Your silver and your gold are mine, and your women and your best sons are mine.’ ” 4 Then the king of Israel answered and said, “As your word, my master the king; I am yours, and all that is mine is yours.” 5 The messengers returned and said, “Thus says Ben-Hadad, saying, ‘I sent to you saying, “Your silver and gold are mine, and your women and your best sons you must give to me.” 6 So at this time tomorrow, I will send my servants to you that they might search your house and the houses of your servants. All the desire of your eyes they will lay hands on and take it away.’ ” 7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, “Please know and realize that this man is seeking trouble, for he sent to me for my women, my sons, my silver, and my gold, and I did not withhold anything from him.” 8 All of the elders and all of the people said to him, “Do not listen and do not consent.” 9 So he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, “Say to my lord the king, ‘All that you demanded from your servant at the first, I will do, but this thing I am not able to do.’ ” Then the messengers went and made a report to him. 10 Then Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, “Thus may the gods do to me and thus may they add if the dust of Samaria is sufficient for the hollow of a hand for all of the people who are at my feet.” 11 The king of Israel answered and said, “Tell him, ‘Let not him who girds on his armor boast as one who takes off his armor.’ ” 12 It happened at the moment he heard this word, he and the kings were drinking in the tents. He said to his servants, “Get ready to attack.” So they got ready to attack the city. 13 Suddenly a certain prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Have you seen all this great crowd? Behold, I am giving it into your hand today, that you may know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 14 Ahab said, “By whom?” And he said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘By the servants of the commanders of the provinces.’ ” He asked, “Who will begin the battle?” And he said, “You.” 15 So he mustered the servants of the commanders of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two. After them he mustered all of the army, all the sons of Israel, seven thousand. 16 They went out at noon while Ben-Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the tents, he and the thirty-two kings helping him. 17 Then the servants of the commanders of the provinces went out first, and Ben-Hadad sent, and they reported to him, saying, “Men have come out from Samaria.” 18 Then he said, “If they have come out for peace, seize them alive; and if they have come out for war, seize them alive.” 19 But these had come out from the city, the servants of the commanders of the provinces, and the army that was after them. 20 Each man killed his man, and the Arameans fled, so Israel pursued them, but Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with cavalry. 21 The king of Israel went out and attacked the horses and the chariots and defeated Aram with a great blow. 22 Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and he said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself; consider well what you should do, for the king of Aram is coming against you at the turn of the year.” 23 The servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their gods are gods of the mountains, therefore they were stronger than we. Let us fight with them in the plain; surely we will be stronger than they. 24 Do this thing: remove the kings each from his post, and put a governor in their place. 25 You must muster an army for yourself as the army you have lost, and horses and chariots as the horses and chariots you lost, then we will fight them in the plain. Surely we will be stronger than they.” So he listened to their voice and did so. 26 It happened at the turning of the year that Ben-Hadad mustered Aram and went up to Aphek for the war with Israel. 27 The Israelites had been mustered and provisioned, and they went to engage them. The Israelites encamped opposite them as two flocks of goats, but the Arameans filled the land. 28 Then the man of God approached, and he spoke to the king of Israel, and he said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Because Aram has said, “Yahweh is a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys,” ’ I will give all this great crowd into your hand that you may know that I am Yahweh.” 29 These encamped opposite for seven days, and it happened on the seventh day that the battle began, and the Israelites killed the Arameans, one hundred thousand infantry in one day. 30 Then those who remained fled to Aphek, to the city, and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who had remained, so Ben-Hadad fled and went to the innermost rooms of the city. 31 Then his servants said to him, “Please now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are kings of mercy. Let us now put sackcloth on around our waists and ropes on our heads. Then let us go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will let you live.” 32 So they tied sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads. Then they went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’ ” And he said, “Is my brother still alive?” 33 The men took this as a good omen and they quickly accepted it as true from him, and they said, “Your brother Ben-Hadad lives.” So he said, “Go, get him.” Ben-Hadad came out to him, and Ahab pulled him up on the chariot. 34 Ben-Hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I shall return. You may set up streets with stalls for yourself in Damascus just as my father set up in Samaria.” Then Ahab said, “On these terms I will let you go,” So he made a covenant with him and let him go. 35 A certain man from the sons of the prophets said to his fellow countryman, “By the word of Yahweh, please strike me.” But the man refused to strike him. 36 He said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, look, as you now are going from me, a lion will kill you.” When he went from beside him, the lion found him and killed him. 37 Then he found another man and said, “Strike me, please,” so the man struck him sharply and wounded him. 38 Then the prophet went and waited for the king along the road and disguised himself with a headband over his eyes. 39 As the king was passing by, he called to the king and said, “Your servant went out in the thick of the battle, and suddenly a man turned and brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man. If by any means he should be missed, it will be your life in his place, or you shall pay a talent of silver.’ 40 It happened that your servant was busy here and there, and he disappeared.” Then the king of Israel said to him, “Your own judgment has been determined.” 41 He quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was from the prophets. 42 He said to him, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Because you have let the man I devoted for destruction go from your hand, your life shall be in place of his life and your people in place of his people.’ ” 43 Then the king of Israel went to his house, sullen and angry, and he came to Samaria.

2 Kings,"1 Elisha said, “Hear the word of Yahweh: ‘Thus says Yahweh, “At this time tomorrow a seah of wheat bread flour will sell for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria.’ ” 2 Then the officer on whom the king relied answered the man of God and said, “Look, even if Yahweh is making windows in heaven, could this thing happen?” And he said, “Look, you will be seeing it with your eyes, but you shall not eat from it there.” 3 Now four men who had a skin disease were at the entrance of the gate, and they said to each other, “Why are we sitting here until we die? 4 If we say, ‘Let us go into the city,’ the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; but if we sit here, we shall die. So then, come, let us fall into the camp of the Arameans. If they let us live, we shall live; but if they kill us, then we shall die.” 5 So they got up at dusk to go to the camp of the Arameans. They went up to the edge of the camp of the Arameans, and look, there was no man there! 6 Now the Lord had caused the camp of the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots, the sound of horses, and the sound of a great army. So they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against us!” 7 So they got up and fled at dusk and left their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and the camp as it was, and they fled for their lives. 8 When these who had the skin disease came to the edge of the camp, they went into a certain tent and they ate, drank, and took from there silver and gold and clothes. Then they went and hid them, then returned and came to another tent, and they took from there and went and hid them. 9 Then they said to one another, “We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news! If we are silent and wait until the light of morning, we will be punished. So then, come, let us go and tell the house of the king.” 10 When they came, they called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, saying, “We came to the camp of the Arameans, and behold, there was no man or the voice of a man there! Only the horses and the donkeys were tied up, and the tents were left as they were.” 11 Then the gatekeepers called and told it inside the house of the king. 12 The king got up in the night and said to his servants, “Please let me tell you what the Arameans have done to us. The Arameans know that we are hungry, so they went out from the camp to hide in the field, saying, ‘When they go out from the city, we shall seize them alive and go into the city.’ ” 13 Then one of his servants replied and said, “Please let them take five of the remaining horses that remain in the city; behold, they are like all of the multitude of Israel that remain in it; they are like all the multitude of Israel who have perished. Let us send and see.” 14 So he took two charioteer horsemen, and the king sent after the camp of the Arameans, saying, “Go, find out,” 15 and they went after them to the Jordan. Look, all of the way was littered with clothes and equipment which the Arameans had thrown away in their haste. Then the messengers returned and told the king. 16 So the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. A seah of wheat flour went for a shekel and two seahs of barley went for a shekel according to the word of Yahweh. 17 Then the king appointed the officer he was depending on over the gate, but the people trampled him and he died, according to that which the man of God had said, which he spoke when the king came down to him. 18 It happened as the man of God spoke to the king, saying, “Two seahs of barley shall be sold for a shekel and a seah of wheat flour for a shekel at this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria.” 19 Then the officer had replied to the man of God and said, “Look, even if Yahweh is opening the windows in heaven, could this thing happen?” And he had said, “Look you are about to see it with your eyes, but you will not eat from it.” 20 So it had happened to him; the people trampled him in the gate and he died. 1 Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Get up and go, you and your household, and dwell as an alien wherever you can, for Yahweh has called for a famine, and it will come to the land for seven years.” 2 So the woman got up and did according to the word of the man of God. She and her household went and dwelt as an alien in the land of the Philistines for seven years. 3 It happened at the end of seven years that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and went out to appeal to the king for her household and for her properties. 4 Now the king was speaking to Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please tell me all of the great things that Elisha has done.” 5 It happened that as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life, suddenly the woman whose son he had restored to life was crying out to the king about her household and about her field. Then Gehazi said, “My lord the king, this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life!” 6 So the king asked the woman, and she told him. So the king appointed for her a certain court official, saying, “Restore all that is hers and all the yield of the field from the day she left the land up to now.” 7 Elisha came to Damascus. Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill, and he was told, “The man of God has come up here.” 8 Then the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift in your hand and go meet the man of God. Inquire of Yahweh from him, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this illness?’ ” 9 So Hazael went to meet him and took a gift in his hand of all of the good things of Damascus, a load on each of forty camels, and he came and stood before him. Then he said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to you, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this illness?’ ” 10 Elisha said to him, “Go; say to him, ‘You shall certainly recover,’ but Yahweh has shown me that he certainly will die.” 11 Then the man fixed his gaze and stared at him until he was ashamed and the man of God cried. 12 Then Hazael asked, “Why is my lord crying?” He said, “Because I know what evil you will do to the Israelites. You will set their fortifications on fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword. Their little ones you will dash to pieces, and their pregnant women you will rip open!” 13 Then Hazael said, “But how could your servant, who is like a dog, do this great thing?” Elisha said, “Yahweh has shown me that you are to be king over Aram.” 14 So he departed from Elisha and came to his master. He asked him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he said, “He said to me that you will certainly recover.” 15 On the next day, he took the bed cover, dipped it in the water, and spread it over his face so that he died. Then Hazael became king in his place. 16 Now in the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab, king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Joram son of Jehoshaphat became the king of Judah. 17 He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 18 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab became his wife, and he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. 19 Yet Yahweh was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, as he had promised to give him a lamp for his sons always. 20 In his days, Edom rebelled against the rule of Judah, and they set up a king over them. 21 So Joram crossed over to Zair and all the chariots with him. It happened that he arose by night and attacked Edom who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots; but the army fled to their tents. 22 So Edom has rebelled against the rule of Judah until this day; then Libnah also rebelled at that time. 23 The remainder of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 24 So Joram slept with his ancestors, and he was buried with his ancestors in the city of David, and Ahaziah his son became king in place of him. 25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Joram became king of Judah. 26 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Athaliah daughter of Omri, king of Israel. 27 He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, as the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab. 28 He went with Joram the son of Ahab for the battle against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-Gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram. 29 Joram the king returned to Jezreel to heal from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought with Hazael king of Aram. Ahaziah the son of Joram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, for he was ill.

2 Kings,"1 Now Elisha the prophet called for one of the sons of the prophets, and he said to him, “Gird your loins, and take this flask of olive oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead. 2 Go there and look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi. Go, for you must cause him to arise from among his brothers, and you must bring him into an inner room. 3 You must take the flask of olive oil and pour it out on his head. You must say, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “I hereby anoint you as king over Israel.” ’ Then you must open the door and flee; do not linger!” 4 So the young man, servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-Gilead. 5 He came, and look, the commanders of the army were sitting there. He said, “I have a word for you, O commander!” Jehu said, “For whom? For all of us?” And he said, “For you, O commander!” 6 He got up and went to the house, and poured the olive oil on his head and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘I hereby anoint you as king over the people of Yahweh, over Israel. 7 You will destroy the house of Ahab your master, and you will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all of the servants of Yahweh, from the hand of Jezebel. 8 All of the house of Ahab will perish, and I shall cut off all males from Ahab, both bond and free. 9 I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. 10 The dogs will eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and there shall not be anyone to bury her.’ ” Then he opened the door and fled. 11 Then Jehu came out to the officers of his master, and they said to him, “Peace? Why did this madman come to you?” And he said to them, “You know the man and his foolish talk.” 12 Then they said, “Liar. Please tell us.” He said, “Thus and so he said to me, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “I hereby anoint you as king over Israel.” ’ ” 13 So they hastened each one to take his cloak, and they spread them under him on the bare steps, blew on the trumpet, and said, “Jehu is king!” 14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram was keeping guard in Ramoth-Gilead, he and all of Israel, because of the threat of Hazael king of Aram. 15 But Joram the king had returned to heal in Jezreel from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Aram. Jehu said, “If this is what you want, do not let him go out as a fugitive from the city to go to make it known in Jezreel.” 16 Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there, and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to visit Joram. 17 Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu when he came, and he said, “I see a company.” Joram said, “Take a horseman and send him to meet them.” And he said, “Is it peace?” 18 So the rider of the horse went out to meet him, and he said, “Thus the king asks, ‘Is it peace?’ ” Then Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Turn after me.” Then the watchman reported, saying, “The messenger went up to them, but he did not return.” 19 Then he sent out a second horseman, and he came to them and said, “Thus the king asks, ‘Is it peace?’ ” Then Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Turn after me.” 20 So the sentinel reported, saying, “He went up to them, but he did not return, and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives with madness.” 21 Then Joram said, “Get ready,” so he got his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel went out, and Ahaziah king of Judah, each with his chariot. They went out to meet Jehu, and they found him at the tract of land of Naboth the Jezreelite. 22 When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, “Is it peace, Jehu?” And he said, “What peace is there while the prostitutions of your mother Jezebel and her sorceries are numerous?” 23 Joram turned his chariot and fled and said to Ahaziah, “It’s treason, Ahaziah!” 24 Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between his shoulders so that the arrow went out from his heart, and he slumped down in his chariot. 25 He said to Bidkar his third servant, “Lift him out and throw him on the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite, for remember, you and I were with the pair of chariots behind Ahab his father when Yahweh pronounced this oracle against him: 26 ‘ “Since I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his children yesterday,” declares Yahweh, “I will requite it for you in this tract of land,” declares Yahweh.’ So then lift him out and throw him on the tract of land according to the word of Yahweh.” 27 When Ahaziah king of Judah saw, he fled the way of Beth-Haggen. Jehu pursued after him and said, “Shoot him also, in the chariot.” They shot him at the ascent of Gur which is in Ibleam, and he fled to Megiddo, but he died there. 28 Then his officers carried him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the city of David. 29 In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah. 30 When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it, so she painted her eyes with black eye paint and adorned her head and looked through the window. 31 Now Jehu had come in the gate, so she said, “Is it peace, O Zimri, murderer of his master?” 32 When he lifted up his face to the window, he asked, “Who is with me?” Two or three eunuchs looked down to him. 33 So he said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down, and her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled her. 34 Then he came and ate and drank, and said, “Please take care of this cursed one and bury her, for she is the daughter of a king.” 35 When they went to bury her, they could not find her, except the skull, the feet, and the palms of the hands. 36 They returned and told him, and he said, “This is the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘On the plot of ground of Jezreel, the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel.’ ” 37 So the dead body of Jezebel became dung on the surface spread on the field in the plot of ground of Jezreel, so one cannot say, “This is Jezebel.” 1 Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria, and Jehu wrote letters, and he sent them to Samaria to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab, saying, 2 “Now, when this letter comes to you and your master’s sons are with you, the chariots are with you, the horses, a fortified city, and weapons, 3 then you must select the best and the most suitable from the sons of your master, and you must place him on the throne of his father, and they must fight for the house of your masters.” 4 But they were very afraid, and they said, “Look, two kings could not stand before him; how can we stand?” 5 So whoever was over the house, and whoever was over the city, and the elders and the guardians sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants; all that you say to us, we shall do. We shall not make anyone a king. Do what is good in your eyes.” 6 Then he wrote to them a second letter, saying, “If you are for me, and you are listening to my voice, take the heads of the men of the sons of your master and come to me at this time tomorrow at Jezreel.” Now the sons of the king, seventy men, were with the leaders of the city who were raising them. 7 When the letter came to them, they took the sons of the king, and they killed seventy men. Then they put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel. 8 Then the messenger came and told him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons,” and he said, “Put them in two piles at the entrance of the gate until morning.” 9 It happened in the morning that he went out, stood, and said to all of the people, “You are righteous. Look, I conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all of these? 10 Know then that the word of Yahweh will not fail which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab; Yahweh has done what he spoke by the hand of his servant Elijah. 11 Then Jehu killed all of the remainder of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all of his leaders, his close friends, and his priests, until there was no survivor left for him. 12 Then he arose and went and came to Samaria. On the way, he was at Beth-Eked of the shepherds, 13 and Jehu met the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah. He asked, “Who are you?” They said, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah; we came down for the peace of the king’s children and the children of the queen.” 14 Then he said, “Seize them alive!” So they seized them alive but then slaughtered them at the cistern of Beth-Eked, forty-two men. He did not allow any of them to survive. 15 Next he went from there and found Jehonadab the son of Recab to meet him. He greeted him and asked him, “Is your heart right with me as my heart is with you?” Then Jehonadab said, “Yes, it is. Give your hand!” And he gave his hand and took him up to him on the chariot. 16 Then he said, “Come with me! Look at my zeal for Yahweh!” So he let him ride in his chariot. 17 Then he came to Samaria and killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria until he wiped them out, according to the word of Yahweh that he had spoken to Elijah. 18 Then Jehu assembled all of the people and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will worship him greatly. 19 So then, summon to me all of the prophets of Baal and all of his servants and his priests; no man should fail to come, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come shall not live!” Now Jehu was acting with cunning in order to destroy the servants of Baal. 20 Then Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!” So they proclaimed it. 21 Jehu sent word through all of Israel, and all of the servants of Baal came; there did not remain a man who did not come. They came to the house of Baal so that the house of Baal was filled from wall to wall. 22 He said to the one who was over the wardrobe, “Bring out clothing for all of the servants of Baal.” So he brought the clothing out for them. 23 Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Recab came to the temple of Baal, and he said to the servants of Baal, “Search and see that there is none of the servants of Yahweh here with you; only those who serve Baal.” 24 They came to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed for himself eighty men outside, and he said, “The man who lets anyone escape from the men who I am entrusting to you, he will pay with his life!” 25 It happened that when he finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the royal guard and to the officers, “Come and kill them; let no man go free!” So they put them to the sword, and the royal guard and the officers threw them out, then they went up to the citadel of the temple of Baal. 26 They brought out the stone pillars of the temple of Baal and burned them. 27 So they broke down the stone pillars of Baal and destroyed the temple of Baal and made it into a latrine until this day. 28 So Jehu wiped out Baal from Israel. 29 Only Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat by which he caused Israel to sin; namely, the calf-shaped idols of gold that were in Bethel and Dan. 30 Yahweh said to Jehu, “Because you have done well by doing right in my eyes and you have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart; therefore, sons of the fourth generation will sit for you on the throne of Israel.” 31 But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of Yahweh God of Israel with all his heart; he did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam by which he caused Israel to sin. 32 In those days, Yahweh began to reduce Israel, so Hazael defeated them in every territory of Israel, 33 from the Jordan eastward: all of the land of Gilead, the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer which is on the Wadi Arnon and Gilead and Bashan. 34 Now the remainder of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all of his powerful deeds, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 35 So Jehu slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria, and Jehoahaz his son became king in his place. 36 Now the days which Jehu had reigned over Israel were twenty-eight years in Samaria.

2 Kings,"1 Now Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, so she prepared to destroy all of the offspring of the royal family. 2 But Jehosheba the daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah took Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, and she stole him from among the sons of the king who were being put to death, putting him and his nurse in the inner bedroom. So they hid him from the presence of Athaliah, and he was not killed. 3 He remained with her in the temple of Yahweh, hidden for six years while Athaliah was reigning over the land. 4 But in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and took the commanders of the hundreds of the Carites and the runners, and he brought them to himself to the temple of Yahweh. Then he made a covenant with them and made them swear in the house of Yahweh and showed them the son of the king. 5 He commanded them, saying, “This is the thing that you must do: one third of you who go off duty on the Sabbath, the keepers of the guard in the house of the king, 6 and another third at the gate of Sur, and a third at the gate behind the runners, shall guard the post of the palace alternately. 7 Two of the units among you, all who go on duty on the Sabbath, guard the post of the temple of Yahweh for the king. 8 You must surround the king all about, each with his weapon in his hand; whoever comes to the ranks must be killed. Be with the king wherever he goes.” 9 So the commanders of hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and each took his men who went off duty on the Sabbath and those who came on duty on the Sabbath, and they came to Jehoiada the priest. 10 Then the priest gave to the commanders of the hundreds spears and small round shields which were King David’s, which were in the temple of Yahweh. 11 So the royal runners stood, each with his weapons in his hand, from the side of the temple to the south up to the side of the temple on the north, around the altar and around the temple, about the king all around. 12 Then he brought out the son of the king, put the crown on him with the testimony, and they made him king, anointed him, clapped their hands, and said, “Long live the king!” 13 When Athaliah heard the sound of the runners of the people, she came to the people at the temple of Yahweh. 14 She looked, and there was the king standing by the pillar according to the custom. The commanders and the trumpeters were by the king, and all of the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing on the trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes and she called, “Treason, treason!” 15 Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the commanders of the hundreds, the appointed of the army, and he said to them, “Bring her out to the house of the ranks! The one coming after her should kill her with the sword,” for the priest had said, “Let her not be killed in the temple of Yahweh.” 16 So they grabbed her as she went by the entranceway of the horses to the palace of the king, and she was killed there. 17 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh and the king and the people, that the people should be as a people for Yahweh, and also a covenant between the king and the people. 18 Then all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down, and its altars and its images they broke completely into pieces. Mattan the priest of Baal they killed in front of the altars. Then the priest put guards over the house of Yahweh. 19 He took the commanders of the hundreds and the Carites and the runners and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the temple of Yahweh. And they marched by the way of the runner’s gate to the palace of the king, and he sat on the throne of the kings. 20 All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city rested; for Athaliah had been killed with the sword in the palace of the king. 21 Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign. 1 In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king. He reigned in Jerusalem forty years, and the name of his mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. 2 Jehoash did right in the eyes of Yahweh all of his days, because Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 3 Only the high places were not removed; the people were still making sacrifices and offering incense on the high places. 4 Jehoash said to the priests, “All of the money for the sacred things that is brought to the temple of Yahweh, the money taxed at its proper value for each person and all of the money that comes upon the heart of a man to bring to the temple of Yahweh, 5 let the priests take for themselves, each from his treasurers, and let them repair the breach of the temple for every place where damage is found.” 6 It happened in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash that the priests had not repaired the damage in the temple. 7 So King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the priests, and he said to them, “Why are you not repairing the damage in the temple? Now, you shall not take money from your treasurers for the damage in the temple. You must provide it.” 8 So the priests agreed not to take money from the people and not to repair the damage to the temple. 9 Then Jehoiada the priest took a certain chest and bored a hole in its lid, and he put it beside the altar to the right as a man enters into the temple of Yahweh; then the priests who were keepers of the threshold would put there all of the money brought into the temple. 10 It happened that when they saw a great deal of money in the chest, the secretary of the king and the high priest would come up, put the money in bags, then count the money found in the temple of Yahweh. 11 They placed the money, which was weighed out, into the hands of the workers who were appointed over the temple of Yahweh, and they paid it to the skilled craftsmen of wood and to the builders working on the temple of Yahweh 12 and to the masons and the stonecutters, to buy timber and stones for hewing, in order to repair the damage of the temple of Yahweh, and for all who went to the temple to repair it. 13 Only, for the temple of Yahweh, there were not any silver basins, snuffers, bowls for drinking wine, trumpets, or any vessel of gold or silver from the money being brought to the temple of Yahweh. 14 For they gave that to all the workers, and they repaired the temple of Yahweh with it. 15 They did not have to settle accounts with the men into whose hands they placed the money to give to the workers, for they were dealing honestly. 16 The money of the guilt offering and the money of the sin offering was not brought into the temple of Yahweh, but were each for the priests. 17 At that time, Hazael king of Aram went up and fought against Gath and captured it; then Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem. 18 Jehoash king of Judah took all of the holy objects that Jehoshaphat, Joram, and Ahaziah his ancestors, the kings of Judah, had devoted, and all his holy objects and all of the gold found in the treasuries of the temple of Yahweh, and in the palace of the king, and he sent them to Hazael king of Aram, so that he went up from Jerusalem. 19 Now the remainder of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 20 Then his servants arose and conspired and killed Joash in the house of the Millo as he was going down toward Silla. 21 Jozabad the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him and killed him, so they buried him with his ancestors in the city of David. Then Amaziah his son became king in his place.

2 Kings,"1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign. 2 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do right in the eyes of Yahweh his God as David his ancestor. 3 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel; he even let his son pass through the fire according to the detestable things of the nations which Yahweh drove out from before the Israelites. 4 He sacrificed and offered incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree. 5 Then Rezin the king of Aram went up with Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel against Jerusalem for battle, and they besieged Ahaz but were not able to defeat him. 6 At that time, Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram and drove out the Judeans from Elath. The Arameans came to Elath and have lived there until this day. 7 Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the king of Aram and from the hand of the king of Israel who are rising up against me.” 8 Ahaz took the silver and gold found in the house of Yahweh and in the treasury rooms of the palace of the king, and he sent a gift to the king of Assyria. 9 So the king of Assyria listened to him and he went up to Damascus and captured it and deported them to Kir. He also killed Rezin. 10 So King Ahaz went to meet Tiglath-Pileser the king of Assyria in Damascus, and he saw the altar that was in Damascus, so King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest the builder’s plan of the altar and the exact model of how it had been made. 11 So Uriah the priest built the altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus; thus Uriah the priest did before King Ahaz came from Damascus. 12 When the king came from Damascus, the king saw the altar, so he went near to the altar and went up on it. 13 Then he offered his burnt offerings and his grain offerings, he poured his libations and dashed the blood of his fellowship offerings against the altar. 14 Now the bronze altar that was before Yahweh, he brought over from the front of the temple, from between his altar and the temple of Yahweh, and he placed it at the side of his altar to the north. 15 Then King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, “On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the grain offering of the evening, the burnt offering of the king and his grain offering, the burnt offering of all of the people of the land, their offerings, their libations, and all of the blood of the burnt offerings, the blood of the sacrifices you must dash on it. But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.” 16 So Uriah the priest did according to all that King Ahaz commanded. 17 Then King Ahaz cut off the side panels of the water carts and removed from upon them the basin, and the sea he took down from the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a stone base. 18 The covering for the Sabbath, which they had built in the palace and in the entrance of the king to the outside, he removed from the temple of Yahweh because of the presence of the king of Assyria. 19 Now the remainder of the acts of Ahaz that he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 20 So Ahaz slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David, and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place. 1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz the king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, reigning nine years. 2 He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, only not as the kings of Israel who were before him. 3 Shalmaneser the king of Assyria came up against him, and Hoshea became his vassal and paid tribute to him. 4 But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea, for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and he did not offer tribute to the king of Assyria as he had year after year; so the king of Assyria arrested him, and confined him in a house of imprisonment. 5 So the king of Assyria went up in all the land, then he went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years. 6 In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported Israel to Assyria. He placed them in Halah, in Habor, in the river regions of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. 7 Now this happened because the Israelites had sinned against Yahweh their God when he brought them up from the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh the king of Egypt and they feared other gods. 8 They walked in the statutes of the nations whom Yahweh had driven out from before the Israelites, which the kings of Israel had introduced. 9 The Israelites secretly did things that were not right against Yahweh their God; they built high places for themselves in all their towns, from the watchtower up to the fortified city. 10 They set up for themselves stone pillars and poles of Asherah worship on every high hill and under every green tree. 11 They burned incense there on all the high places, like the nations which Yahweh deported before them, and they did evil things to provoke Yahweh. 12 They served idols of which Yahweh had said to them, “You shall not do this thing!” 13 Yahweh warned Israel and Judah by the hand of his every prophet, with every seer saying, “Turn from all of your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my ordinances, according to all the law which I commanded your ancestors, which I sent to you by the hand of my servants the prophets.” 14 But they did not listen and they stiffened their necks, like the necks of their ancestors who did not believe in Yahweh their God. 15 They rejected his statutes, his covenant which he made with their ancestors, and his warnings which he gave to them; and they went after the idols, became vain, and went after all the nations which were all around them, which Yahweh had commanded them not to do as they did. 16 They abandoned all the commands of Yahweh their God and made for themselves two molten calf-shaped idols; they made a pole of Asherah worship and bowed down to the army of the heavens and served Baal. 17 They made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire, they practiced divination and read omens, and they sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of Yahweh to provoke him. 18 So Yahweh was very angry with Israel and he removed them from his presence; none remained except the tribe of Judah alone. 19 Even Judah did not keep the commands of Yahweh their God, and they walked in the customs of Israel which they introduced, 20 so Yahweh rejected all the offspring of Israel and punished them, and he gave them into the hand of the plunderers until he banished them from his presence. 21 For he had torn Israel from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king, but Jeroboam detached Israel from following Yahweh, and he made them sin a great sin. 22 The Israelites walked in all the sins of Jeroboam that he committed, and they did not depart from it, 23 until Yahweh removed Israel from his presence as he had foretold by the hand of all his servants, the prophets. And so he deported Israel from upon his land to Assyria until this day. 24 The king of Assyria brought from Babylonia, from Cush, from Arva, from Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and he settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the Israelites, so they took possession of Samaria and lived in her cities. 25 It happened that when they began living there, they did not fear Yahweh, so Yahweh sent lions among them, and they were killing them. 26 So they said to the king of Assyria, “The nations whom you deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the customs of the God of the land, so he sent lions among them, and now they are killing them because they do not know the customs of the God of the land.” 27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Release one of the priests whom you deported from there, and let him go and settle there. Let him teach them the customs of the God of the land.” 28 So one of the priests went, whom they had deported from Samaria, and he settled in Bethel and was teaching them how they should fear Yahweh. 29 Yet every nation was making their gods, and they put them in the shrine of the high places that the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they were living. 30 The men of Babylonia made Succoth Benoth; the men of Cush made Nergal; the men of Hamath made Ashima. 31 The Arvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; the Sepharvites were burning their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim. 32 Those who were fearing Yahweh made priests of the high places from among themselves, and they were sacrificing for them in the shrines of the high places. 33 Yahweh they were fearing, but their gods they were serving, according to the customs of the nations from which they were deported. 34 Until this day they are doing according to their former customs; none of them are fearing Yahweh, and none of them are doing according to their statutes, to their decisions, to the law, or to the commands that Yahweh commanded the descendants of Jacob to whom he had given the name Israel. 35 Yahweh had made a covenant with them and commanded them, “You shall not fear other gods, nor shall you bow down to them, nor shall you serve them, nor shall you sacrifice to them. 36 Rather, Yahweh, who brought you out from the land of Egypt with great strength and with an outstretched arm—him you shall fear, and to him you shall bow down, and to him you shall sacrifice. 37 The statutes, the decisions, the law, and the commands that he wrote to you, you shall observe to do always, and you shall not fear other gods. 38 The covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget, and you shall not fear other gods. 39 But Yahweh your God you shall fear, and he will deliver you from the hand of all of your enemies.” 40 They did not listen but kept on doing according to their former customs. 41 So these nations were fearing Yahweh, but they were serving their idols, as were their children and their children’s children; as their ancestors did, they are doing until this day.

1 Samuel,"1 Now there was a man from Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjaminite, a very wealthy man. 2 He had a son whose name was Saul, a young and handsome man. There was not a man from the Israelites more handsome than he was; from his shoulders up, he was taller than all the people. 3 Now the female donkeys of Kish the father of Saul got lost, and Kish said to Saul his son, “Please take one of the servants with you and get up; go and seek the female donkeys.” 4 So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim; he passed through the land of Shalisha but they did not find them. They passed through the land of Shaalim but they were not there. He passed through the land of Benjamin but did not find them. 5 When they entered the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, lest my father cease caring about the female donkeys and worry about us!” 6 But he said to him, “Look, a man of God is in this town, and the man is honored. All that he says certainly comes true. So then let us go there; perhaps he will tell us about our journey on which we have gone.” 7 So Saul said to his servant, “Look, we may go, but what should we bring to the man? For the bread is gone from our bags, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have with us?” 8 The servant again answered Saul and said, “Look, I have in my hand a quarter shekel of silver! I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us our way.” 9 (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say: “Come, let us go up to the seer.” For the prophet of today was formerly called a seer.) 10 So Saul said to his servant, “Your suggestion is a good one. Come, let us go.” And they went to the town where the man of God was. 11 They were going up the ascent of the town when they found young women going out to draw water. They said to them, “Is there the seer here?” 12 They answered them and said, “There is. Look, he is just in front of you! Hurry now, because he has come to the town today, because there is a sacrifice for the people today at the high place. 13 As soon as you enter the town, you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice. Then afterward the invited guests will eat. So then, go up, because you will find him today!” 14 So they went up to the town. As they were entering into the middle of the town, Samuel was coming forth to meet them, to go up to the high place. 15 Now Yahweh had revealed this to Samuel the day before Saul arrived, saying, 16 “This time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you must anoint him as leader over my people Israel. He will deliver my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have seen the suffering of my people, because their cry of distress has come to me.” 17 When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh answered him, “Here is the man about whom I told you! This is the one who will govern my people.” 18 Then Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate and said, “Please tell me, where is the house of the seer?” 19 Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place, and you will eat with me today; then I will send you away in the morning. I will tell you all that is on your mind. 20 And as for your female donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not be concerned about them, because they have been found. For whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not for you and for all the house of your father?” 21 Saul answered and said, “Am I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the humblest of all the families of the tribes of Benjamin? Why do you speak to me in this way?” 22 So Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them to a room in the building and gave them a place at the head of the invited guests. There were about thirty men. 23 Then Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion that I gave to you, about which I said to you, ‘Keep it with you.’ ” 24 So the cook took up the shank and what was on it and put it before Saul, and he said, “Look, the saved portion is placed before you—eat, because it has been kept for you for the appointed time,” and he said, “I have invited the people.” So Saul ate with Samuel that day. 25 When they came down from the high place to the town, he spoke with Saul on the roof. 26 They got up early, and as dawn was breaking, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, “Get up, so that I can send you away.” So Saul got up and the two of them, he and Samuel, went outside. 27 As they were going down to the outskirts of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to pass on before us. When he has passed, you stand here a while, so that I can make known to you the word of God.” 1 Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it over his head and kissed him and said, “Has not Yahweh anointed you as leader over his inheritance? 2 As you go from with me today, you will find two men near the burial site of Rachel in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will say to you, ‘The female donkeys that you went to search for have been found.’ Now look, your father is no longer concerned about the female donkeys and has begun worrying about you, saying, ‘What should I do about my son?’ 3 Then you will go on from there and further you will come to the oak of Tabor. There three men will meet you, who are going up to God at Bethel. One will be carrying three male kid goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and one will be carrying a skin of wine. 4 They will ask how you are doing and will give you two loaves, which you will take from their hand. 5 After this, you will come to the Gibeah of God, where there are sentries of the Philistines. Just as you enter the town there, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place, with harp, tambourine, flute, and zither before them, and they will be prophesying. 6 Then the Spirit of Yahweh will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will turn into a different person. 7 When these signs come to you, do for yourself what your hand finds to do, for God will be with you. 8 Then you will go down before me to Gilgal. Look, I am coming down to you to offer burnt offerings and to make fellowship offerings. You must wait seven days until I come to you. Then I will let you know what you should do.” 9 Just as he turned his shoulder to depart from Samuel, God changed his heart. And all these signs were fulfilled on that day. 10 When they went from there to Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them. 11 And when all who knew him formerly saw that he prophesied with prophets, the people said to one another, “What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” 12 And a man from there responded and said, “And who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb: “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 13 When he finished prophesying, he went to the high place. 14 Then Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To search for the female donkeys; and when we saw none, we went to Samuel.” 15 So Saul’s uncle said to him, “Please tell me, what did Samuel say to you?” 16 Then Saul said to his uncle, “He told us for certain that the female donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingship of which Samuel had spoken. 17 Then Samuel summoned the people to Yahweh at Mizpah, 18 and he said to the Israelites, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: ‘I brought Israel up from Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.’ 19 But you today have rejected your God who always delivers you from all of your calamities and your distresses. You have said to him, ‘No, but you must appoint a king over us!’ So then present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes and by your clans.” 20 So Samuel brought near all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected by lot. 21 Then he brought near the tribe of Benjamin according to its families, and the family of Matri was selected by lot. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen, and they sought him, but he could not be found. 22 So they inquired again of Yahweh, “Did the man come here?” And Yahweh said, “Look, he is hiding himself among the baggage.” 23 So they ran and took him from there, and when he took his stand among the people, he was taller than all the people from his shoulders and up. 24 Then Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom Yahweh has chosen? For there is no one like him among all the people!” And all the people shouted and said, “Long live the king!” 25 Then Samuel told the people the custom of the kingship, and he wrote the rules down on a scroll and laid it before Yahweh. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each to his own house. 26 And Saul also went to his house at Gibeah, and the troops whose hearts God had touched went with him. 27 However, some worthless men said, “How can this man deliver us?” So they despised him and brought no gift to him, but he kept silent.

1 Samuel,"1 Now Nahash the Ammonite went up and encamped against Jabesh Gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us and we will serve you.” 2 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition I will make a treaty with you, by gouging out the right eye of each of you, so that I can make it a disgrace for all Israel.” 3 So the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Leave us alone for seven days so that we may send messengers in all the territory of Israel, and if there is no deliverer for us, then we will come out to you.” 4 When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, they reported these things to the people. Then all the people lifted up their voices and wept. 5 Just then, Saul was coming from the field behind the cattle. Saul said, “What is the matter with the people, that they are weeping?” So they recounted to him the words of the men of Jabesh. 6 Then the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and he became very angry. 7 So he took a yoke of oxen and cut them into pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, “Whoever is not going out after Saul and after Samuel, so will it be done to his oxen.” Then the fear of Yahweh fell on the people and they went out as one man. 8 He mustered them at Bezek; the Israelites were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah were thirty thousand. 9 They said to the messengers who had come, “Thus you will say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: ‘Tomorrow deliverance for you will come when the sun is hot.’ ” When the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced. 10 The men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.” 11 And the next day Saul placed the people in three divisions. Then they came into the middle of the camp at the early morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. It happened that the remainder were scattered so that no two among them remained together. 12 Then the people said to Samuel, “Who is the one who asked, ‘Will Saul reign over us?’ Give the men to us that we may kill them.” 13 But Saul said, “No one will be put to death on this day, because today Yahweh has provided deliverance in Israel.” 14 Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal, and let us renew the kingship there.” 15 So all the people went to Gilgal and they made Saul king there before Yahweh in Gilgal. They sacrificed fellowship offerings there before Yahweh. Then Saul rejoiced there greatly along with all the men of Israel. 1 Then Samuel said to all Israel, “Look, I have listened to your voice regarding all that you have said to me, so I have set a king over you. 2 And so then here is the king walking about before you. Now I am old and gray, but my sons (look at them!) are with you; and I have walked about before you from my youth until this day. 3 Here I am! Testify against me before Yahweh and before his anointed one! Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I exploited? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe, that I may shut my eyes regarding him?–then I will restore it to you.” 4 Then they said, “You have not exploited us or oppressed us, and you have not taken anything from the hand of anyone.” 5 So he said to them, “Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed one is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” Then they said, “He is witness.” 6 Then Samuel said to the people, “Yahweh is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your ancestors up from the land of Egypt. 7 So then take your stand, so that I may judge you before Yahweh with regard to all the deeds of justice of Yahweh that he performed with both you and your ancestors. 8 “When Jacob came to Egypt, your ancestors cried out to Yahweh, so he sent Moses and Aaron, and they brought your ancestors out from Egypt and settled them in this place. 9 But they forgot Yahweh their God, so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the hosts of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. 10 So they cried out to Yahweh and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh and have served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hand of our enemies and we will serve you!’ 11 So Yahweh sent Jerub-Baal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel. Then he delivered you from the hand of your enemies all around, and you lived in security. 12 “And when you saw that Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, was coming against you, you said to me, ‘No! A king shall reign over us,’ although Yahweh your God is your king. 13 So then look! Here is the king you have chosen, for whom you have asked! Look, Yahweh has placed a king over you! 14 If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not be rebellious against what Yahweh says, and both you and the king who rules over you will follow after Yahweh your God, all will be well. 15 But, if you do not listen to the voice of Yahweh, and you rebel against what Yahweh says, then the hand of Yahweh will be against you as it was against your ancestors. 16 So then take your stand again and see this great thing that Yahweh is going to do before your eyes. 17 Is the wheat harvest not today? I will call out to Yahweh so that he still sends thunder and rain, so that you will know and will see that your wickedness is great that you have done in the eyes of Yahweh by asking for a king for yourselves.” 18 So Samuel called out to Yahweh, and Yahweh brought thunder and rain that same day, so all the people feared Yahweh and Samuel greatly. 19 Then all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God so that we will not die, because we have added to all our sins by requesting a king for ourselves.” 20 And Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear! You have done all this evil; only do not turn aside from following Yahweh. But you must serve Yahweh with all your heart. 21 And do not turn aside after the triviality, which have no value and cannot deliver, for they are triviality. 22 For Yahweh will not forsake his people for the sake of his great name, because Yahweh has decided to make you his own people. 23 Also, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh by ceasing to pray for you! I will instruct you in the good and righteous way. 24 Only fear Yahweh and serve him faithfully with all of your heart. For consider what great things he has done for you. 25 But if you continue to do wickedness, both you and your king will be swept away.” ","1 Samuel 11,12",http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-samuel-11-12-296394/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-08-30_1-samuel-11-12_20120814163711.mp3
1 Samuel,"1 Saul was thirty years old at the beginning of his reign, and he reigned forty-two years over Israel. 2 He chose for himself three thousand from Israel. Two thousand of these were with Saul at Micmash in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. He sent away the rest of the people, each to his tent. 3 Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!” 4 And all Israel did hear, saying, “Saul has defeated the garrison of the Philistines; and also, Israel has become a stench among the Philistines!” So the people were called out after Saul at Gilgal. 5 And the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and an army as numerous as sand which is on the seashore. And they came up and encamped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven. 6 When the men of Israel saw that it was too difficult for them, because the army was hard pressed, the people hid themselves in the caves, in the thorn bushes, in the cliffs, in the vaults and in the wells. 7 Some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the army followed him trembling. 8 He waited seven days according to the appointed time Samuel determined, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the army started to slip away from him. 9 So Saul said, “Bring here to me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” Then he offered up the burnt offering. 10 Just as he finished offering the burnt sacrifice, Samuel was coming. So Saul went out to meet him and to bless him. 11 But Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul said, “Because I saw that the army was scattering from me and you did not come at the appointed time and that the Philistines had gathered at Micmash, 12 therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not yet implored the face of Yahweh.’ So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering.” 13 Then Samuel said to Saul, “You have behaved foolishly! You have not kept the command of Yahweh your God which he commanded you. For then, Yahweh would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. 14 But now, your kingdom will not endure. Yahweh has sought for himself a man according to his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him as leader over his people, because you have not kept what Yahweh commanded you.” 15 Then Samuel got up and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul mustered the people who were found with him, about six hundred men. 16 Saul and Jonathan his son and the army that remained with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, and the Philistines encamped at Micmash. 17 The raiders went out from the camp of the Philistines in three divisions. One division turned on the road to Ophrah toward the land of Shual. 18 One division turned on the road to Beth Horon, and one turned on the road toward the border overlooking the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. 19 Now no skilled craftsman could be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, “So that the Hebrews cannot make swords or spears for themselves.” 20 So all Israel went down to the Philistines, each to have his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, and his iron plowshare sharpened. 21 The charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshare and for the mattock, and a third of a shekel for the pick and for the axe, and to set the goading sticks. 22 So on the day of battle, there was not a sword or a spear found in the hands of all the army that was with Saul and Jonathan, but Saul and his son Jonathan had them. 23 Now the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Micmash. 1 One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to his armor bearer, “Come and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines which is over there.” But he did not tell his father. 2 Now Saul was staying at the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree that was in Migron, and the troops that were with him were about six hundred men. 3 Now Ahijah, the son of Ahitub (the brother of Ichabod), the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of Yahweh at Shiloh, was carrying an ephod. The troops did not know that Jonathan had gone. 4 Now between the passes where Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of the Philistines there was a crag of rock on one side and a crag of rock on the other. The name of the one was Bozez and the name of the other was Seneh. 5 The one crag on the north was opposite Micmash and the other on the south was opposite Geba. 6 So Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come, let us go over to the garrisons of these uncircumcised; perhaps Yahweh will act for us, for there is no hindrance for Yahweh to save by many or by few.” 7 And his armor bearer said, “Do all that is in your heart that you are inclined to do. I am with you all of the way! 8 Then Jonathan said, “Look, we are about to go over to the men; and we will show ourselves to them. 9 If they say to us: ‘Wait until we reach you,’ then we will stand as we are and not go up to them. 10 But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for Yahweh has given them into our hand, and this will be the sign for us.” 11 So the two of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, and the Philistines said, “The Hebrews are coming out from the holes in which they have hidden themselves.” 12 Then the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, “Come up to us and we will show you something!” Then Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up after me, for Yahweh has given them into the hand of Israel!” 13 So Jonathan went up on his hands and his feet, with his armor bearer after him. They fell before Jonathan and then his armor bearer would kill them after him. 14 So was the first attack in which Jonathan and his armor bearer killed about twenty men within about half of a furrow in an acre of an open field. 15 Then there was terror in the camp, in the open field, and among all the army of the garrison. Even the raiders trembled. The earth shook, and it became a very great panic. 16 And the lookouts of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin saw that the multitude surged back and forth. 17 Saul said to the troops that were with him, “Please call the roll and see who has gone from us.” So they called the roll and found that Jonathan and his armor bearer were not present. 18 Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring near the ark of God” (for the ark of God was at that time with the Israelites). 19 While Saul was still speaking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more, so Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand!” 20 Then Saul and all the troops who were with him were assembled on command and came up to the battle, and look! Each Philistine’s sword was against his friend; and there was a very great confusion. 21 The Hebrews who had been for the Philistines previously, who had gone up with them into the camp all around, even they joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 22 All the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, so even they pursued them closely in the battle. 23 So on that day Yahweh delivered Israel, and the battle shifted to Beth Aven. 24 Now the men of Israel were hard pressed on that day, because Saul had made the army take an oath, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats any food until evening, when I will have avenged myself on my enemies!” So none of the army tasted any food. 25 (Now all the people of the land used to go into the forest, for there was honey on the surface of the ground.) 26 When the army came to the forest, look! There was honey flowing, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the army was afraid of the solemn oath. 27 However, Jonathan had not heard about the oath of his father with the army, so he extended the end of the staff which was in his hand, and he dipped it into the honeycomb. Then he put his hand to his mouth and his eyes gleamed. 28 Then a man from the army informed him and said, “Your father made the army swear a solemn oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food today,’ ” so the army is exhausted. 29 Then Jonathan said, “My father has brought trouble on the land! See now that my eyes have brightened because I have tasted a little of this honey. 30 How much more could have been done if the troops had eaten freely today from the plunder of their enemies that they had found! For now the loss among the Philistines is not great.” 31 They defeated the Philistines that day from Micmash to Aijalon, and the troops were very weary. 32 Then the troops took the plunder: they took sheep and cattle and calves and slaughtered them on the ground and the troops ate them all with the blood. 33 So they reported it to Saul, saying, “Look! The troops are sinning against Yahweh by eating the animals with the blood!” And he said, “You have dealt treacherously! Roll to me a large stone today!” 34 Then Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the troops and say to them, ‘Bring to me each one his ox and each his sheep and slaughter them in this place and eat, but do not sin against Yahweh by eating the animals with the blood.’ ” So all the troops brought them, each leading his ox in his hand that night, and slaughtered it there. 35 Then Saul built an altar to Yahweh; it was the first altar he built to Yahweh. 36 Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and let us plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave alive a man among them.” So they said, “Do all that is good in your eyes.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.” 37 So Saul inquired of God, “Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him on that day. 38 Then Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the people, so that we find out what the sin was this day. 39 For as Yahweh lives, who delivers Israel, I swear that even if it is in Jonathan my son, he will certainly die!” But nobody from all the army answered him. 40 Then he said to all Israel, “You will be on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other.” And the army said to Saul, “Do what is good in your eyes.” 41 Then Saul said to Yahweh the God of Israel, “Render a decision perfectly.” Jonathan and Saul were chosen by lot and the people went out. 42 Then Saul said, “Let them cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan,” and Jonathan was chosen. 43 So Saul said, “Tell me what you have done.” So Jonathan told him and said, “I merely tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am, I must die.” 44 Then Saul said, “So may God do to me and more, you will certainly die today, Jonathan!” 45 But the army said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die, who accomplished this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh lives, not a hair from his head will fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the army ransomed Jonathan and he did not die. 46 Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their place. 47 So Saul took the kingship over Israel, and he fought all around against his enemies, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. He inflicted punishment against all who rebelled. 48 He acted bravely and defeated the Amalekites and rescued Israel from the hand of those who plundered it. 49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua; the names of his two daughters were as follows: the name of the firstborn was Merab and the younger was Michal. 50 The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz, and the name of the commander of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. 51 Now Kish was the father of Saul, but Ner, the father of Abner, was the son of Abiel. 52 Warfare was severe against the Philistines all the days of Saul. Whenever Saul saw anyone who was a mighty warrior or any brave man, he conscripted him into his service.

1 Samuel,"1 Then Yahweh said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn about Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel! Fill up your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen a king for myself among his sons.” 2 But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears, he will kill me.” Yahweh said, “You must take a heifer from the herd with you, and you must say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.’ 3 You will invite Jesse to the sacrifice and I will make known to you what you must do. You will anoint for me the one whom I tell you.” 4 So Samuel did what Yahweh said. He came to Bethlehem, and the elders of the city came trembling to meet him. They said, “Have you come in peace?” 5 He said, “I come in peace. I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” So he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. 6 When they came, he saw Eliab and said, “Surely his anointed one is before Yahweh!” 7 But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For God does not see what man sees, for a man looks on the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks on the heart.” 8 Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel, and he said, “This one also Yahweh has not chosen.” 9 So Jesse made Shammah pass before Samuel, but he said, “Yahweh also has not chosen this one.” 10 And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen any of these.” 11 Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all the young men here?” And he said, “The youngest still remains, but look, he is shepherding the flock.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him, for we cannot sit down until he comes here.” 12 So he sent and brought him. Now he was ruddy with beautiful eyes and of handsome appearance. And Yahweh said, “Arise, anoint him, for this is he.” 13 So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. Then the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon David from that day on. Then Samuel got up and went to Ramah. 14 Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul and an evil spirit from Yahweh tormented him. 15 So the servants of Saul said to him, “Look please, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 16 Please, let our lord command your servants who are before you! Let them seek a man skilled in playing on the lyre. When the evil spirit from God is upon you, he can play on it and you will feel better.” 17 So Saul said to his servants, “Please select a man who plays a stringed instrument well and bring him to me.” 18 One of the servants answered and said, “Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing a stringed instrument, a brave man, a warrior, prudent in speech, and handsome. And Yahweh is with him.” 19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son who is with the sheep.” 20 And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread and a skin of wine and one young goat and sent them to Saul by the hand of David his son. 21 So David came to Saul and entered his service. He loved him greatly and he became Saul’s armor bearer. 22 Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me, because he has found favor in my sight.” 23 So whenever the evil spirit from God came to Saul, David would take the stringed instrument and play it with his hand. Then it would bring relief for Saul; he would feel better and the evil spirit would depart from him. 1 The Philistines gathered their camps for battle and they were gathered at Socoh which belongs to Judah. They camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes Dammim. 2 Then Saul and the men of Israel were gathered and encamped in the valley of Elah, and they formed ranks for the battle to meet the Philistines. 3 The Philistines were standing on the hill on one side and the army of Israel was standing on the hill on the other side with the valley between them. 4 Then a champion went out from the camps of the Philistines, whose name was Goliath from Gath. His height was six cubits and a span. 5 A bronze helmet was on his head, and he was clothed with scale body armor; the weight of the body armor was five thousand bronze shekels. 6 Bronze greaves were on his legs, and a bronze javelin was slung between his shoulders. 7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam and the point of his spear weighed six hundred iron shekels. His shield bearer was walking in front of him. 8 He stood and called to the battle lines of Israel and said to them, “Why have you come out to form ranks for battle? Am I not the Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Commission for yourselves a man and let him come down to me. 9 If he is able to fight with me and he defeats me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail over him and defeat him, then you will be our servants and you will serve us.” 10 Then the Philistine said, “I hereby defy the battle lines of Israel today! Give me a man so that we may fight each other!” 11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and very afraid. 12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite. This man was from Bethlehem of Judah, and his name was Jesse. He had eight sons; in the days of Saul this man was old, yet he still walked among the men. 13 The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone and followed Saul to the battle. The names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, his second oldest was Abinadab, and the third was Shammah. 14 Now David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, 15 but David went back and forth from Saul to feed the sheep of his father in Bethlehem. 16 Now the Philistine came forward early and late, and he took his stand for forty days. 17 Then Jesse said to his son David, “Please take for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and bring them quickly to the camp for your brothers. 18 And these ten portions of cheese you will bring to the commander of the thousand; find out how your brothers are doing, and take their pledge.” 19 Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah fighting the Philistines. 20 David rose early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper, and he took the provisions and went as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampment while the troops were going to the battle line, and they raised the war cry. 21 Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle lines, one battle line against the other. 22 David left the baggage he had with him in the care of the baggage keeper, ran to the battle line, and came and asked how his brothers were doing. 23 While he was speaking to them, the champion, whose name was Goliath the Philistine from Gath, was coming up from the caves of the Philistines. He spoke just as he had previously, and David heard his words. 24 When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from his presence and were very afraid. 25 And the men of Israel said, “Did you see this man who has come up? For he is going up to defy Israel! It will be that the man who defeats him, the king will make him very rich with great wealth and will give him his daughter in marriage and will make his father’s house free in Israel.” 26 Now David had spoken to the men who were standing with him, saying, “What will be done for the man who defeats this Philistine and removes the disgrace from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he defies the battle lines of the living God?” 27 And the troops had spoken to him according to this word, saying, “So it will be done for the man who defeats him.” 28 His oldest brother Eliab heard while he was speaking to the men, and Eliab became very angry against David and said, “Why have you come down today, and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumptuousness and the evil of your heart! For you have come down in order to see the battle!” 29 David replied, “What have I done now? I merely asked a question! 30 He turned around from him to another opposite him and he spoke to him in the same way, and the people answered him as before. 31 Now the words which David had spoken were heard and they reported them to Saul, and he summoned him. 32 David said to Saul, “Do not let anyone’s heart fail concerning him! Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” 33 But Saul said to David, “You will not be able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, because you are only a boy, whereas he has been a man of war since his childhood!” 34 And David said to Saul, “Your servant has been a shepherd of the flock for his father. If the lion or the bear would come and carry off a sheep from the group, 35 I would go out after it and strike it down and rescue the sheep from its mouth. If it rose against me, I would grab it by its beard and strike it down and kill it. 36 Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he defied the battle lines of the living God.” 37 And David said, “Yahweh, who rescued me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear, will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine!” Then Saul said to David, “Go and may Yahweh be with you!” 38 Then Saul clothed David with his own fighting attire and put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with body armor. 39 Then David strapped on his sword over his fighting attire, but he tried in vain to walk around, for he was not trained to use them. So David said to Saul, “I am not able to walk with these, because I am not trained to use them.” So David removed them. 40 Then he took his staff in his hand, picked out for himself five smooth stones from the wadi, and he put them in his shepherd’s bag, in the pouch. And with his sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine. 41 Then the Philistine came on, getting nearer and nearer to David, with his shield bearer in front of him. 42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him, for he was only a boy and ruddy with a handsome appearance. 43 So the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you are coming to me with sticks?” Then the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 44 The Philistine said to David, “Come to me so that I can give your flesh to the birds of heaven and to the wild animals of the field!” 45 Then David said to the Philistine, “You are coming to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I am coming to you in the name of Yahweh of hosts, the God of the battle lines of Israel, whom you have defied! 46 This day Yahweh will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head! Then I will give the corpses of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of heaven and to the animals of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God who is for Israel. 47 And all of this assembly will know that Yahweh does not rescue with sword or with spear, for the battle belongs to Yahweh, and he will give you into our hands!” 48 When the Philistine got up and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly to the battle line to meet the Philistine. 49 Then David put his hand into the bag and took a stone from it and slung it. He struck the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground. 50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with the sling and with the stone, and he struck down the Philistine and killed him, but there was no sword in David’s hand. 51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it from its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 52 The men of Israel and Judah got up, raised the war cry, and pursued the Philistines as far as the valley and up to the gates of Ekron. So the slain of the Philistines fell on the way to Shaaraim up to Gath and as far as Ekron. 53 Then the Israelites returned from pursuing the Philistines and plundered their camp. 54 And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem and placed his weapons in his tent. 55 Now when Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Whose son is this young man, Abner?” And Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.” 56 Then the king said, “You inquire whose son this young man is.” 57 So when David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. The head of the Philistine was in his hand. 58 Then Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David said, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.” ","1 Samuel 16,17",http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-samuel-16-17-296397/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-09-04_1-samuel-16-17_20120814163905.mp3
1 Samuel,"1 David went from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s household heard, they came down to him there. 2 Every man in distress and every man who had a creditor and every embittered man gathered to him, and he became their commander. Now there were about four hundred men with him. 3 And David went up from there to Mizpah of Moab. He said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me.” 4 So he brought them before the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the days David was in the stronghold. 5 Then Gad the prophet said to David, “You should not stay in the stronghold; leave and go into the land of Judah.” So David left and came to the forest of Hereth. 6 Now Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been located. Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree at Ramah. Now his spear was in his hand and all his servants were stationed around him. 7 Then Saul said to the servants who were standing around him, “Please listen, Benjaminites! Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? 8 For all of you have conspired against me, and no one discloses to me the making of an agreement between my son and the son of Jesse! None of you have had sympathy for me or disclosed to me that my son commissioned my servant against me to ambush me as has been done this day!” 9 But Doeg the Edomite, who was stationed among the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 10 And he inquired of Yahweh for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.” 11 So the king sent to summon Ahimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, and all his father’s household, the priests who were at Nob. So all of them came to the king. 12 Saul said, “Listen please, son of Ahitub.” He said, “Here I am, my lord.” 13 Then Saul said to him, “Why did you conspire against me, you and the son of Jesse, when you gave to him bread and a sword, and by inquiring of God for him so that he might arise against me to ambush me as has been done this day?” 14 But Ahimelech answered the king and said, “And who among all your servants is as faithful as David? He is the son-in-law of the king who moves quickly to safeguard you and is honored in your house. 15 Only today I began to inquire of God for him. Far be it from me that the king should impute anything against his servant or against my father’s household, for your servant has not known any of this matter, little or much.” 16 Then the king said, “You must certainly die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s household!” 17 So the king said to the runners who were stationed around him, “Turn and kill the priests of Yahweh, because they also support David and because they knew that he was fleeing and did not disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king were not willing to raise their hand to attack the priests of Yahweh. 18 Then the king said to Doeg, “You turn and attack the priests!” So Doeg the Edomite turned and attacked the priests himself, and on that day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. 19 And he put to the sword Nob, the city of the priests, from man to woman, from child to infant, and ox and donkey and sheep; all to the sword. 20 But, one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, whose name was Abiathar, escaped and fled after David. 21 Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of Yahweh. 22 Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day that Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would certainly tell Saul. I am responsible for the deaths of all your father’s household! 23 Stay with me! Do not fear, because he who seeks my life seeks your life. You are in good care with me.” 1 Now they told David, “Look, the Philistines are fighting in Keilah and they are raiding the threshing floors.” 2 So David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?” And Yahweh said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah.” 3 But David’s men said to him, “Look, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more if we go to Keilah to the battle lines of the Philistines?” 4 So David again inquired of Yahweh, and Yahweh answered him and said, “Get up, go down to Keilah, for I am giving the Philistines into your hand.” 5 So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines. They drove off their livestock and dealt them a heavy blow. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. 6 Now when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he went down with an ephod in his hand. 7 When it was told to Saul that David had gone to Keilah, Saul said, “God has given him into my hand, because he has shut himself in by going into a city with two barred gates. 8 Saul then summoned all of the army for the battle, to go down to Keilah to lay a siege against David and his men. 9 When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.” 10 And David said, “O Yahweh, God of Israel, your servant has clearly heard that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah to destroy the city because of me. 11 Will the rulers of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O Yahweh, God of Israel, please tell your servant!” And Yahweh said, “He will come down.” 12 Then David said, “Will the rulers of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And Yahweh said, “They will deliver you.” 13 So David and his men got up, about six hundred men, and went out from Keilah and wandered wherever they could go. When it was told to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he stopped his pursuit. 14 David remained in the wilderness, in the strongholds, and in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him continually, but God did not give him into his hand. 15 When David realized that Saul had gone out to seek his life, David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh. 16 So Jonathan the son of Saul got up and went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him through God. 17 He said to him, “Do not be afraid, for the hand of my father Saul will not find you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. My father Saul knows this also.” 18 Then the two of them made a covenant before Yahweh. David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went to his house. 19 Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the hill of Hakilah, which is south of Jeshimon? 20 So then, O king, whenever you want to come down, come down, and it will be for us to deliver him into the hand of the king.” 21 And Saul said to them, “May you be blessed by Yahweh, for you have shown me compassion! 22 Go, please, make certain again! Find out and see exactly where he is and who has seen him there! For they have said to me, ‘He is very cunning.’ 23 Look, find out all of the hiding places where he hides. Then return to me with dependable information, and I will go with you. And then if he is there in the land, then I will seek him among all the thousands of Judah.” 24 Then they got up and went to Ziph before Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah, to the south of Jeshimon. 25 And Saul and his men went to seek him, and they told David, so he went down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard this, he pursued David into the wilderness of Maon. 26 Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men went on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, while Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them. 27 But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, because the Philistines have made a raid on the land!” 28 So Saul returned from pursuing David, and he went to confront the Philistines. Therefore, they called that place the Rock of Division. 29 David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of En Gedi.

1 Samuel,"1 Then David thought to himself, “Now I will perish one day by the hand of Saul! There is nothing better for me but that I must certainly escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will desist from searching for me further in all of the territories of Israel, and so I will escape from his hand.” 2 So David got up and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, the king of Gath. 3 David settled with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each with his household. David took along his two wives Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 4 And it was reported to Saul that David had fled to Gath, so he no longer searched for him. 5 Then David said to Achish, “Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, then let them give me a place in one of the country towns that I can live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?” 6 So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day. (Therefore, Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until this day.) 7 The number of days that David lived in the countryside of the Philistines was one year and four months. 8 Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites, for they had been living in the land for a long time in the direction of Shur and as far as the land of Egypt. 9 So David struck the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive; he took the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned and came to Achish. 10 And Achish said, “Against whom have you raided today?” David said, “Against the Negev of Judah and against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites and against the Negev of the Kenites.” 11 And David did not leave alive a man or a woman to bring them back to Gath, thinking, “So that they will not report about us, saying, ‘David did thus and so.’ ” Thus was his practice all the days that he lived in the countryside of the Philistines. 12 And Achish trusted David, saying, “He has made himself utterly hated among his people in Israel, and he will be my servant forever.” 1 Now in those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war to fight against Israel. So Achish said to David, “Certainly you realize that you must go out with me in the army, you and your men.” 2 David said to Achish, “Very well, you will know what your servant can do.” Achish said to David, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.” 3 (Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him, and they had buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had expelled the mediums and the soothsayers from the land.) 4 Then the Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem, so Saul assembled all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa. 5 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly. 6 And Saul inquired of Yahweh, but Yahweh did not answer him, not by dreams or by the Urim or by the prophets. 7 So Saul said to his servants, “Search for me a woman who is a medium so that I may go to her and inquire of her.” His servants said to him, “Look there is a woman who is a medium in Endor.” 8 So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went with two of his men. And they came to the woman by night and he said, “Please consult a spirit for me through the ritual pit, and bring up for me the one whom I tell you.” 9 But the woman said to him, “Look, you know what Saul did, how he exterminated the mediums and the soothsayers from the land! Why are you setting a trap for my life to kill me?” 10 Then Saul swore to her by Yahweh, “As Yahweh lives, you will not be punished for this thing.” 11 So the woman asked, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel for me.” 12 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and the woman said to Saul, “Why did you deceive me? You are Saul!” 13 The king said to her, “Do not be afraid! What do you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up from the ground!” 14 Then he said to her, “What is his appearance?” She said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.” Then Saul realized that it was Samuel, and he knelt with his face to the ground and bowed down. 15 Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul said, “I am in distress! For the Philistines are about to make war against me, but God has turned away from me, and he does not answer me any more, not by the prophets or by the dreams. So I called to you to let me know what I should do.” 16 Then Samuel said, “Why do you ask me, since Yahweh has turned away from you and has become your enemy? 17 Yahweh has done to you just as he spoke by my hand! Yahweh has torn the kingdom from your hand and has given it to your neighbor, to David. 18 Because you did not obey Yahweh and did not carry out the fierce anger of his wrath against Amalek, therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you today. 19 And Yahweh will also give Israel with you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me, and Yahweh will also give the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.” 20 Then Saul immediately fell prostrate to the ground, and he was very afraid because of the words of Samuel; there was no more strength in him, for he had not eaten food all day and all night. 21 Then the woman came to Saul and realized that he was absolutely terrified, so she said to him, “Look, your female servant has obeyed you, and I have risked my life. I have listened to your words that you have spoken to me. 22 So then, you also please listen to the voice of your female servant, and let me set before you a morsel of bread, and you eat so that you will have strength in you when you go on your way.” 23 But he refused and said, “I will not eat!” However, his servants urged him, and the woman also. So he listened to what they said, and he got up from the ground and sat on the bed. 24 Now the woman had a fattened bull calf in the house, so she quickly slaughtered it and took flour, kneaded dough, and baked him some unleavened bread. 25 She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they got up and went away that very night.

1 Samuel,"1 Now the Philistines assembled all their forces at Aphek, and Israel was encamped at the spring that is in Jezreel. 2 The rulers of the Philistines were passing on according to hundreds and thousands, David and his men passing on at the rear with Achish. 3 Then the commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, “Is this not David, the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, who has been with me for days and years? I have not found anything threatening in him from the day of his desertion until this day!” 4 But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him and they said to him, “Send the man back so that he might return to his place where you have assigned him! But he will not go down with us into the battle, so that he does not become an adversary to us in the battle. By what could this fellow make himself favorable to his lord? Is it not with the heads of these men? 5 Is this not David about whom they sing in the dances, saying, ‘Saul has killed his thousands, but David his ten thousands’?” 6 So Achish called David and said to him, “As Yahweh lives, certainly you were honest, and I am pleased to have you marching with me in the campaign. For I have not found any wrong in you from the day you came to me until this day, but in the eyes of the rulers, you are not good. 7 So then, return and go in peace, so that you do not do something that displeases the rulers of the Philistines.” 8 Then David said to Achish, “But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant from the day that I entered your service until this day, that I should not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?” 9 And Achish answered and said to David, “I know that you are good in my eyes, like an angel of God! However, the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us into the battle.’ 10 So then, rise early in the morning, you and the servants of your lord who came with you. When you rise early in the morning and it is light enough for you, leave. 11 So David set out early, he and his men, to leave in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines, but the Philistines went up to Jezreel. 1 Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. When they attacked Ziklag, they burned it with fire. 2 They took captive the women who were in it, from the youngest to the oldest. They did not kill anyone, but carried them off and went on their way. 3 When David and his men came to the city, they saw, and it was burned with fire, and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive. 4 Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until there was not enough strength in them to weep. 5 Two of David’s wives had been taken captive. Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 6 And David was in a very precarious situation, for the people spoke of stoning him, for the souls of all the people were bitter, each one over his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God. 7 Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring the ephod here for me.” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 8 And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Should I pursue after this band of raiders? Will I overtake them?” He said to him, “Pursue them, for you will certainly overtake them, and you will certainly rescue them.” 9 So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the Wadi Besor, but the rest remained. 10 David pursued, he and four hundred men; but two hundred men stayed because they were too exhausted to pass over the Wadi Besor. 11 Then they found an Egyptian man in the open country and brought him to David, and they gave him food and he ate; they also gave him water. 12 They gave him a slice of fig cake and two raisin cakes; he ate and this revived him, because he had not eaten food or drunk water for three days and three nights. 13 Then David said to him, “To whom do you belong, and from where are you? The young man said, “I am an Egyptian young man, a servant of an Amalekite man, but my master abandoned me because I became ill three days ago. 14 We raided the Negev of the Kerethites and that which belongs to Judah and then the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.” 15 So David asked him, “Will you take me down to this band of raiders?” He said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me and that you will not deliver me into my master’s hand! Then I will take you down to this band.” 16 So he took him down, and there they were, spread out over the surface of all the land, eating and drinking and dancing because of all of the abundant plunder which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. 17 Then David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled. 18 So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; David also rescued his two wives. 19 None of theirs was missing from the smallest to the greatest, even sons and daughters, from the plunder up to everything they had taken for themselves; David brought back everything. 20 And David took all of the sheep, and the cattle they drove along in front of that livestock, and they said, “This is David’s plunder.” 21 Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David; they had left them behind at the Wadi Besor. They went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. David came near with the people and asked them how they were doing. 22 Then all the corrupt and useless men among the men who went with David reacted and said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them anything from the plunder which we recovered, except each man may take his own wife and children. They must take them along and go!” 23 But David said to them, “You should not do so, my brothers, with what Yahweh has given to us! He has preserved us and has given the raiding band that came against us into our hand. 24 And who would listen to you regarding this matter? For as the share of the one who went down into the battle, so the share of the one who remained with the baggage will be. They will share alike.” 25 So from that day and beyond, he made it a rule and a regulation for Israel until this day. 26 Then David came to Ziklag, and he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, “Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the enemies of Yahweh!” 27 It was for those in Bethel, for those in Ramoth of the Negev, for those in Jattir, 28 for those in Aroer, for those in Siphmoth, for those in Eshtemoa, 29 for those in Racal, for those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites, for those in the towns of the Kenites, 30 for those in Hormah, for those in Bor Ashan, for those in Athach, 31 for those in Hebron, and for all the places where David and his men had roamed.

2 Samuel,"1 It happened after this that David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah?” And Yahweh said to him, “Go up.” David asked, “Where shall I go up?” And he said, “To Hebron.” 2 So David went up there along with his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 3 Also, David brought up his men who were with him, each with his household, and they settled in the towns of Hebron. 4 Then the men of Judah came, and they anointed David there as king over the house of Judah, and they told David, “The men of Jabesh-Gilead buried Saul.” 5 So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead and said to them, “May you be blessed by Yahweh because you did this loyal love with your lord, with Saul, and you buried him. 6 Now may Yahweh show loyal love and faithfulness with you. I will also show the good with you that you have done in this matter. 7 So then, let your hands be strong and be valiant, for your lord Saul is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me as king over them.” 8 But Abner the son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim. 9 He made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over Israel, all of it. 10 Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel and he reigned two years; however, the house of Judah followed David. 11 The number of days that David was king over Hebron, over the house of Judah, was seven years and six months. 12 Abner the son of Ner and the servants of Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 13 Then Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out, and they met at the pool of Gibeon. The one group sat on one side of the pool, and the other sat on the other side. 14 Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men come up and fight in our presence.” And Joab said, “Let them come up.” 15 So they came forward and passed by in number: twelve for Benjamin and for Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. 16 Then each seized his opponent by the head and each thrust his sword in the side of his opponent, so they fell together. So they called the name of that place Helkath Hazzurim, which is in Gibeon. 17 Then the battle became increasingly fierce on that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated before the servants of David. 18 The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was swift with his feet as one of the gazelles which is in the open field. 19 So Asahel pursued Abner, and he did not turn aside to the right or to the left from going after Abner. 20 Abner turned around and said, “Are you this Asahel?” And he said, “Yes.” 21 Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right or to your left; seize for yourself one of the young men, and take his belongings for yourself.” But Asahel was not willing to turn aside from him. 22 So Abner said to Asahel once again, “For your own sake, turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you down to the ground? How could I show my face to Joab your brother?” 23 But he refused to turn away, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of the spear, and the spear went out of his back. He fell there and he died on the spot. Then all who came to the place where Asahel fell and died just stood there. 24 So Joab and Abishai pursued Abner when the sun went down. And they came to the hill country of Ammah, which is before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. 25 The descendants of Benjamin rallied after Abner, and they became as one fighting group and stood on the top of a certain hill. 26 Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Will the sword devour forever? Do you not know that there will be bitterness in the end? How long will you not tell the people to turn away from pursuing their brothers?” 27 Joab said, “As God lives, for if you had not spoken, the people would surely have gone up in the morning, each one of them from following after his brother.” 28 Then Joab blew on the trumpet and all the people stopped, and they no longer pursued after Israel, and they did not fight with them again. 29 Then Abner and his men went through the Arabah all that night, and they crossed over the Jordan. They went all the forenoon and came to Mahanaim. 30 After Joab returned from pursuing Abner, he gathered all the people; nineteen of the servants of David were missing along with Asahel. 31 The servants of David had killed some of the Benjaminites among the men of Abner; three hundred and sixty men had died. 32 Then they picked up Asahel and buried him in the grave of his father, which was at Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all that night arriving in Hebron at first light. 1 The battle was prolonged between the house of Saul and the house of David, but David was growing stronger and stronger while the house of Saul was becoming weaker and weaker. 2 And sons were born to David in Hebron; his firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam from Jezreel. 3 His second was Kileab by Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; the third was Absalom the son of Maacah, who was the daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur. 4 The fourth was Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth was Shephatiah the son of Abital. 5 The sixth was Ithream by Eglah the wife of David. These were born to David in Hebron. 6 As the war between the house of Saul and the house of David was continuing, Abner was strengthening himself in the house of Saul. 7 Saul had had a concubine, and her name was Rizpah the daughter of Aiah. Then Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, “Why did you have sex with my father’s concubine?” 8 Abner became very angry at the words of Ish-Bosheth, and he said, “Am I the head of a dog which is for Judah today? Do I not continue to show loyal love with the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends? I have not let you fall into the hands of David, yet you have accused me of sin with this woman today. 9 Thus may God punish Abner, if I do not accomplish what Yahweh has sworn to David; 10 specifically, to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah from Dan to Beersheba!” 11 And Ish-Bosheth was no longer able to answer Abner because he feared him. 12 Abner sent messengers to David where he was, saying, “To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me! Look, my hand is with you to bring all of Israel over to you!” 13 He said, “Good. I will make a covenant with you. I am asking only one thing from you: You shall not see my face unless you bring Michal the daughter of Saul when you come to see me.” 14 Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul, saying, “Give me my wife Michal whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.” 15 So Ish-Bosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish. 16 But her husband went with her, weeping all along after her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go and return.” So he returned. 17 The word of Abner came to the elders of Israel, saying, “For quite some time you were seeking David as king over you. 18 So then, bring it about, because Yahweh had said to David, “Through the hand of David my servant I am about to save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.” 19 Abner also spoke privately to Benjamin. Abner also went to speak to David in Hebron, all that was good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of all the house of Benjamin. 20 Then Abner came to David in Hebron and with him were twenty men. David had prepared a feast for Abner and for the men who were with him. 21 And Abner said to David, “Let me get up and go and gather all of Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you so you can reign over all which your soul desires.” So David dismissed Abner, and he left in peace. 22 And look, the servants of David and Joab came from the raid, and they brought much plunder with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had dismissed him, and he had gone in peace. 23 When Joab and all the army that was with him came, they told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he left in peace.” 24 Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Abner came here to you? Why have you dismissed him that he actually went away? 25 You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you. He came to learn about your going out and coming in and to know all which you are doing.” 26 Then Joab went out from David, and he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from Bor Hasirah, but David did not know it. 27 When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate to speak with him in private. Then he struck him in the stomach there and he died, for he had shed the blood of Asahel his brother. 28 When David heard this afterwards, he said: “I and my kingdom are innocent before Yahweh forever for the blood of Abner the son of Ner. 29 May the blood come down on the head of Joab and all the house of his father. May the house of Joab never lack one with a bodily discharge or one with leprosy or one who grasps the distaff or one who falls by the sword or one who is lacking food.” 30 So Joab and Abishai, his brother, killed Abner because he had killed Asahel, their brother, at Gibeon in the battle. 31 David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothing and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner.” Now King David was following after the bier. 32 And they buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. 33 The king sang a lament for Abner and said, “Should Abner have died the death of a fool? 34 Your hands were not tied and your feet were not in contact with bronze fetters. You have fallen as one who falls before sons of wickedness.” Then all the people wept over him again. 35 Then all the people came to give David food. Still on that day, David swore, “May God punish me if I taste food or anything before the sun goes down.” 36 All the people noticed, and it was good in their eyes, as everything that the king did was good in the eyes of all the people. 37 Then all the people and all of Israel realized on that day that the king had not desired to kill Abner the son of Ner. 38 Then the king said to his servants, “Did you not realize that a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel? 39 I am weak today even though anointed king, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are crueler than I am. May Yahweh pay them back for doing wickedness according to their own wickedness.” ","2 Samuel 2,3",http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/2-samuel-2-3-298590/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-09-17_2-samuel-2-3_20120829150503.mp3
2 Samuel,"1 When the son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his courage failed and all of Israel was horrified. 2 Two of the men, commanders of the raiding bands, were for the son of Saul. The name of one was Baanah, and the name of the other was Recab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the descendants of Benjamin; also, Beeroth was regarded as belonging to Benjamin. 3 The Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and they are resident aliens there until this day. 4 (Now Jonathan the son of Saul had a son who was crippled in the feet. He was five years old when the message of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse had picked him up and fled. It happened that as she was hurrying away to flee, he fell and became crippled. His name was Mephibosheth.) 5 When the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Recab and Baanah, set out, they came at the heat of the day to the house of Ish-Bosheth while he was taking a noontime rest. 6 They came as far as the middle of the house as if takers of wheat, and they struck him in the stomach. Then Recab and Baanah his brother escaped. 7 When they had come into the house, he was lying on his couch in his bedchamber, and they attacked him and killed him. Then they beheaded him, and they took his head and went on the way of the Arabah all night. 8 They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron, and they said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life. Yahweh has given to my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and on his offspring.” 9 Then David answered Recab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and he said to them, “As Yahweh lives, who redeemed my soul from all trouble, 10 when the one who told me, “Look, Saul is dead,” thought that he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him at Ziklag, which was as my giving the news back to him. 11 How much more when wicked men kill a righteous man in his house, on his bed! So then, shall I not seek his lifeblood from your hand, so that I may destroy you from the earth?” 12 Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them, and they cut off their hands and their feet, and they hung them at the pool at Hebron, but the head of Ish-Bosheth they took and buried in the grave of Abner at Hebron. 1 So all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and they said, “Here we are, we are your flesh and blood. 2 For some time, when Saul was king over us, you were leading Israel in and out. Yahweh had said to you, ‘You shall be the shepherd of my people Israel, and you will be the leader over Israel.’ ” 3 All the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron in the presence of Yahweh; then they anointed David as king over Israel. 4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign; he reigned forty years. 5 He reigned over Judah at Hebron for seven years and six months; and he reigned over all Israel and Judah at Jerusalem for thirty-three years. 6 The king and his men went to Jerusalem, to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land. They said to David, “You will not come here, for even the blind and the lame can turn you back, saying, ‘David cannot come here.’ ” 7 David captured the fortress of Zion, the city of David. 8 David had said, “On that day when we attack the Jebusites, one must attack the lame and the blind, those who hate the soul of David, by means of the water supply.” For thus the blind and the lame would say, “He cannot come into the house.” 9 David occupied the fortress and called it the city of David. And David built all around it from the Millo and inward. 10 David continued growing stronger and stronger, and Yahweh the God of hosts was with him. 11 So Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, along with cedar trees and craftsmen skilled in wood and in stone masonry, and they built a house for David. 12 David realized that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel and that he had exalted his kingdom because of his people Israel. 13 David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to him. 14 These are the names of the ones born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon; 15 Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia; 16 Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet. 17 When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David as king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David, but David heard and went down to the stronghold. 18 Now the Philistines had come, and they spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 19 And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up to the Philistines? Will you give them into my hands?” Yahweh said to David, “Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand.” 20 So David came to Baal Perazim and defeated them there; and David said, “Yahweh has burst through my enemies before me like the bursting of water.” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim. 21 They had left their idols there, so David and his men carried them away. 22 Once again the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 23 So David inquired of Yahweh, but he said, “You shall not go up. Rather, go around to their rear and come to them from opposite the balsam trees. 24 And it shall be that when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then pay attention, for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.” 25 So David did thus, just as Yahweh had commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines from Geba all the way to Gezer.

2 Samuel,"1 It happened afterwards that David attacked the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Metheg Ammah from the hands of the Philistines. 2 When he defeated Moab, he measured them with the cord, making them lie on the ground. He measured two cords to kill and the third cord to let live. So Moab became servants of David, bringing tribute. 3 Then David struck down Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to restore his monument at the Euphrates River. 4 David captured from him one thousand and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand foot soldiers. David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but from them he spared a hundred chariot horses. 5 When Aram of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand men of Aram. 6 David placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, so Aram became servants of David, bringing tribute. Yahweh protected David everywhere he went. 7 David took the small round gold shields which had belonged to the servants of Hadadezer, and he brought them to Jerusalem. 8 From Betah and from Berothai, the towns of Hadadezer, King David took very many bronze items. 9 When Toi, the king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer, 10 Toi sent Joram his son to King David to greet him and to congratulate him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had often been at war with Toi. He brought with him objects of silver and objects of gold and objects of bronze. 11 King David dedicated them also to Yahweh along with the silver and the gold that he had dedicated from all of the nations which he had subdued; 12 from Aram and from Moab and from the Ammonites and from the Philistines and from Amalek and from the plunder of Hadadezer the son of Rehob, the king of Zobah. 13 So David made a name for himself when he returned from defeating Aram in the Valley of Salt, eighteen thousand. 14 He put garrisons in Edom; all over Edom he put garrisons, and all of Edom became servants of David. Yahweh protected David wherever he went. 15 David reigned over all of Israel, and he was administering justice and righteousness for all his people. 16 Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was secretary. 17 Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests and Seraiah was scribe. 18 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and the sons of David were priests. 1 Then David said, “Is there still anyone who is left for the house of Saul that I may show loyal love to him for the sake of Jonathan?” 2 Now Saul’s household had a servant whose name was Ziba, so they summoned him to David, and the king asked him, “Are you Ziba?” He said, “At your service!” 3 Then the king said, “But is there still anyone of Saul’s household that I may show the loyal love of God with him?” And Ziba said to the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan who is lame in the feet.” 4 The king said to him, “Where is he?” And Ziba said to the king, “He is here in the house of Makir the son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.” 5 So King David sent and brought him from the house of Makir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar. 6 So Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David. And he fell on his face and did obeisance. David said, “Mephibosheth,” and he said, “I am ready to serve you.” 7 Then David said to him, “Don’t be afraid, for I will certainly show loyal love to you for the sake of Jonathan your father, and I will restore to you all the lands of Saul your father. And you shall always eat food at my table.” 8 Then he did obeisance and said, “What is your servant that you have paid attention to the dead dog like me?” 9 David summoned Ziba the servant of Saul and said to him, “All that was Saul’s and all his household I have given to the son of your master. 10 You shall till the land for him, you and your sons and your servants; you shall bring in the produce and it shall be food for the son of your master that he may eat. But Mephibosheth the son of your master may always eat food at my table.” (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty slaves.) 11 Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my master the king commands his servant, so your servant will do.” So Mephibosheth was eating at his table as one of the sons of the king. 12 Now Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micah, and all of the dwelling of the household of Ziba became servants for Mephibosheth. 13 And Mephibosheth was living in Jerusalem, because he was continually eating at the table of the king, even though he was lame in both of his feet.

2 Samuel,"1 Afterwards the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun ruled in his place. 2 David said, “I will show loyal love with Hanun, the son of Nahash, as his father showed loyal love with me.” So David sent to console him concerning his father, by the hand of his servants. And the servants of David came to the land of the Ammonites. 3 But the commanders of the Ammonites said to Hanun their master, “In your opinion, is David honoring your father because he has sent condolences to you? Is it not in order to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it that David sent his servants to you?” 4 Then Hanun took the servants of David, and he shaved off half of their beards and cut their garments off in the middle up to their buttocks, then sent them away. 5 When they told David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Remain in Jericho until your beards have grown, and then you can return.” 6 When the Ammonites saw that they had become odious to David, the Ammonites sent word and hired Aram Beth-Rehob and Aram-Zobah, twenty thousand infantry; and they also hired the king of Maacah, a thousand men, and the men of Tob, twelve thousand men. 7 When David heard, he sent Joab and all the army of mighty warriors. 8 The Ammonites came out and drew up a battle formation at the entrance of the gate, but Aram-Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were alone in the open field. 9 When Joab saw that the battle was to be fought on two fronts, he chose from all the members of the elite troops of Israel and lined them up for battle to meet Aram. 10 The rest of the army he placed into the hand of his brother Abishai, who arranged them in battle lines to meet the Ammonites. 11 Then he said, “If Aram is stronger than I am, you must become my deliverer; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to rescue you. 12 Be strong, and let us strengthen ourselves for the sake of the people and for the sake of the cities of our God. May Yahweh do what is good in his eyes. 13 Joab and all the people who were with him moved forward into the battle against Aram, and they fled from before him. 14 When the Ammonites saw that Aram had fled, they fled from before Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem. 15 When the Arameans saw that they were defeated before Israel, they gathered themselves together. 16 Then Hadadezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates, and they came to Helam. Now Shobach, the commander of the army of Hadadezer, was at their head. 17 David was told, so he gathered all Israel and crossed over the Jordan and came to Helam. Aram arranged themselves in battle lines to meet David, and they fought with him. 18 And Aram fled before Israel, and David killed from the Arameans seven hundred chariot teams and forty thousand horsemen. He struck down Shobach, the commander of his army, and he died there. 19 When all the kings, the servants of Hadadezer, saw that he had been defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them, and Aram was afraid to help the Ammonites any longer. 1 It came about in the spring, at the time kings go out, David sent Joab and his servants with him and all of Israel. They ravaged all of the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah, but David was remaining in Jerusalem. 2 It happened late one afternoon that David got up from his bed and walked about on the roof of the king’s house, and he saw a woman bathing on her roof. Now the woman was very beautiful. 3 David sent and inquired about the woman, and someone said, “Is this not Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?” 4 Then David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he slept with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) And she returned to her house. 5 The woman became pregnant, and she sent and told David, and she said, “I am pregnant.” 6 So David sent to Joab, “Send Uriah the Hittite to me.” So Joab sent Uriah to David. 7 Uriah came to him, and David asked how Joab and the army fared and how the war was going. 8 David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” So Uriah went out from the king’s house, and a gift from the king went out after him. 9 But Uriah slept at the entrance of the king’s house with all the servants of his master and did not go down to his house. 10 They told David, “Uriah did not go down to his house.” David said to Uriah, “Are you not coming from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?” 11 Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are living in the booths; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping on the surface of the open field; and I, shall I go to my house to eat and to drink and to sleep with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I surely will not do this thing.” 12 David said to Uriah, “Remain here today, and tomorrow I will send you away.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem on that day and the next. 13 David invited him, and he ate and drank in his presence so that he became drunk, and he went out in the evening to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house. 14 And it happened in the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and he sent it by the hand of Uriah. 15 He had written in the letter, “Put Uriah in the front, in the face of the fiercest fighting, then draw back from behind him so that he may be struck down and die.” 16 When Joab was besieging the city, he put Uriah toward the place which he knew there were valiant warriors. 17 The men of the city came out and fought with Joab. Some from the army from the servants of David fell; Uriah the Hittite also died. 18 Joab sent and told David all of the news of the battle. 19 He instructed the messenger, saying, “As you are finishing to speak all the news of the battle to the king, 20 if the anger of the king rises and he says to you, ‘Why did you go near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from atop the wall? 21 Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerub-bosheth, if not a woman who threw an upper millstone on him from atop the wall and he died at Thebez? Why did you go near the wall?’ Then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.’ ” 22 Then the messenger left, and he came and told David all that Joab had sent him to say. 23 The messenger said to David, “Because the men overpowered us, the men came out to us in the field, but we forced them back to the entrance of the gate. 24 The archers shot at your servant from atop the wall, and some of the servants of the king died; your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.” 25 Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab, ‘Do not feel badly about this matter; now one and then another the sword will devour. Intensify your attack on the city and overthrow it.’ ” And he encouraged him. 26 When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned over her husband. 27 When the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his household, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing which David had done was evil in the eyes of Yahweh.

2 Samuel,"1 It happened afterwards that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon the son of David fell in love with her. 2 And Amnon was so frustrated that he felt ill because of Tamar his sister, because she was a virgin, and it was too difficult in Amnon’s eyes to do anything with her. 3 Now Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, the brother of David. (Now Jonadab was a very crafty man.) 4 And he said to him, “Why are you so sullen every morning, O son of the king? Will you not tell me?” And Amnon said to him, “I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.” 5 Then Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and appear ill. If your father comes to see you, you shall say to him, ‘Please let Tamar my sister come and give me food to eat, and let her prepare the food before my eyes, in order that I may see it and eat from her hand.’ ” 6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill, and the king came to see him. Amnon said to the king, “Please let Tamar my sister come, and let her bake two cakes before my eyes that I may eat from her hand.” 7 So David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, “Please go to the house of Amnon your brother and prepare food for him.” 8 Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother. Now he was lying down, and she took the dough and kneaded it and made cakes before his eyes, and she baked the cakes. 9 Then she took the pan and poured it out before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, “Let all the men go out from me.” So all the men went out from him. 10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food to the private room that I may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them to Amnon her brother in the private room. 11 When she brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister!” 12 Then Tamar said to him, “No, my brother! Do not force me, for such a thing has not been done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing! 13 As for me, where should I take my disgrace? You will be as one of the fools in Israel. So please, speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.” 14 But he was not willing to listen to her voice. He was stronger than she, and he forced her and lay with her. 15 Then Amnon hated her very deeply, for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. So Amnon said to her, “Get up and go.” 16 She said to him, “No, because this evil in sending me away is greater than the other you have done to me.” But he was not willing to listen to her. 17 Then he called his young man who was serving him and said, “Please send this woman from me to the outside, and bolt the door behind her!” 18 Now there was a long-sleeved robe on her, for so they clothed the daughters of the king who were virgins, in robes. His servant put her outside, and he bolted the door behind her. 19 Tamar put ashes on her head, and she tore the long-sleeved robe which was on her. She put her hand on her head, and she went away, crying out as she went. 20 Absalom her brother said to her, “Was Amnon your brother with you? But now, my sister, be quiet; he is your brother. Do not take this matter to heart.” So Tamar remained a desolate woman in the house of Absalom her brother. 21 Now King David heard all these things, and he became very angry. 22 Absalom did not speak with Amnon either bad or good, for Absalom hated Amnon over the matter when he raped Tamar his sister. 23 About two full years later, Absalom’s shearers were in Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom summoned all the sons of the king. 24 Then Absalom went to the king and said, “Look, here are your servant’s shearers; please let the king and his servants go with your servant. 25 The king said to Absalom, “No my son, not all of us shall go, so that we not be a burden to you.” And he urged him, but he was not willing to go, but he blessed him. 26 So Absalom said, “But will you not let Amnon my brother go with us?” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?” 27 But Absalom pressed him, so he sent Amnon with him and all of the sons of the king. 28 Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “Please watch. At the moment the heart of Amnon is tipsy with wine, then I shall say to you, ‘Strike Amnon down,’ and you shall kill him! Don’t be afraid. Is it not I myself who has commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant! 29 So Absalom’s servants did to Amnon just as Absalom commanded, and all the sons of the king got up, and each mounted his mule and fled. 30 While they were on the way, the message came to David, “Absalom has killed all the sons of the king, and not one of them was left.” 31 Then the king rose and tore his garments, and he lay on the ground, and all his servants standing by were tearing their garments. 32 Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, the brother of David, responded and said, “My lord should not think that all the young men, the sons of the king, are dead, because only Amnon is dead. Absalom was talking about it, as it was being determined from the day he raped Tamar his sister. 33 So then, let not my lord the king set his heart on this matter, thinking, ‘All the sons of the king are dead,’ for only Amnon alone is dead.” 34 So Absalom fled, and the young man who was keeping watch lifted up his eyes and saw, and there were many people coming from the road behind him from the side of the mountain. 35 Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the sons of the king have come. According to the word of your servant, so it has come about.” 36 When he finished speaking, look, the sons of the king came and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also, the king and all his servants wept a very great weeping. 37 Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, the king of Geshur. David mourned over his son day after day. 38 But Absalom had fled and went to Geshur, and he was there three years. 39 King David longed to go out to Absalom, for he was consoled that Amnon had died. 1 Joab the son of Zeruiah realized that the mind of the king was on Absalom. 2 So Joab sent to Tekoa and took from there a wise woman, and he said to her, “Please pretend to mourn and put on garments of mourning. You should not anoint yourself with oil, and you must act like this woman who has been mourning over the dead for a long time. 3 Then you must go to the king and speak to him according to this word.” Thus Joab put the words in her mouth. 4 So the Tekoite woman spoke to the king, and she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance. She said, “Help me, O king!” 5 Then the king asked her, “What do you want?” And she said, “Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead. 6 Your servant had two sons, and they both fought in the open field, and there was no one to part them. One struck the other and killed him. 7 And look, all of the family has risen up against your servant, and they said, ‘Give up the one who struck his brother, that we may kill him in exchange for the life of his brother whom he murdered. We will also wipe out the heir,’ and so they would put out my embers which remain, by not preserving for my husband a name and a remnant on the face of the earth.” 8 Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I myself will give the command concerning you.” 9 The Tekoite woman said to the king, “On me, my lord the king, is the guilt, and on the house of my father, but the king on his throne is innocent.” 10 The king said, “Whoever has spoken to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you again.” 11 Then she said, “Please may the king remember Yahweh your God, to prevent the increase of blood avengers who kill, so that they not wipe out my son.” He said, “As Yahweh lives, surely not one hair shall fall from your son to the ground.” 12 The woman said, “Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.” And he said, “Speak.” 13 The woman said, “But why have you plotted like this against the people of God? By speaking this word, he is guilty not to bring back his banished one. 14 For we must certainly die, and we are as the waters spilled to the ground which cannot be gathered. God will not take a life but devises plans for a banished person not to be cast out from him. 15 Now I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, because the people made me afraid, and your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the king, perhaps the king will grant the request of his servant. 16 For the king will listen, to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who seeks to destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.’ 17 Your servant also thought, ‘May the word of my lord the king bring rest, for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king, to sense what is good and what is bad.’ May Yahweh your God be with you.” 18 The king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not withhold from me a thing which I am about to ask you.” The woman said, “Please let my lord the king speak.” 19 The king asked, “Was the hand of Joab with you in all of this?” The woman answered and said, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, surely one cannot go to the right or to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken. Yes, your servant Joab himself commanded me, and he put all of these words in the mouth of your servant. 20 In order to change the situation, your servant Joab did this thing. But my lord has wisdom, as the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all that is on the earth.” 21 Then the king said to Joab, “Look, please, I will grant this thing. Go and bring back the young man Absalom.” 22 Joab fell with his face to the ground and did obeisance. And he blessed the king, and he said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant.” 23 Then Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 24 The king said, “Let him go over to his house, and he may not see my face.” So Absalom went over to his house, and did not see the face of the king. 25 As far as Absalom, there was not a more handsome man in all of Israel to admire so much; from the sole of his foot up to his crown, there was no physical defect on him. 26 When he shaved his head, it would happen every year, which he did because it was heavy on him, he would shave it off and weigh the hair of his head: two hundred shekels by the king’s weight. 27 Three sons were born to Absalom and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a woman beautiful of appearance. 28 Absalom lived in Jerusalem two full years, but he did not see the face of the king. 29 So Absalom sent for Joab, in order that he send him to the king, but he was not willing to go to him. He sent again a second time, but he was not willing to go. 30 So he said to his servants, “Look at the tract of land of Joab next to mine, for he has barley plants there. Go, set it ablaze with fire.” So the servants of Absalom set the tract of land ablaze with fire. 31 Then Joab got up and went to Absalom, to the house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my tract of land ablaze with fire?” 32 Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I have sent to you, saying, ‘Come here that I may send you to the king to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there.” ’ So then, let me see the face of the king; if there is guilt in me, then let him kill me.” 33 So Joab went to the king and he told him. Then he summoned Absalom, and he came to the king, and he bowed down to him with his face to the ground before the king. Then the king kissed Absalom.

2 Samuel,"1 It happened afterward that Absalom made himself a chariot with horses and fifty men running before him. 2 Absalom used to rise early in the morning, and he stood beside the road at the gate; anyone who had a legal dispute to bring to the king for judgment Absalom would call to him and say, “Where are you from?” And he would say, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.” 3 Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your case is good and right, but for you there is no hearing with the king.” 4 Then Absalom would say, “Oh, that someone would appoint me as judge in the land, that anyone might come to me who had a legal dispute or a case, and I would give him justice.” 5 It happened whenever anyone drew near to do obeisance to him, that he would stretch his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. 6 Absalom did like this to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel. 7 It happened at the end of four years that Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow which I have made to Yahweh in Hebron, 8 for your servant made a vow while I was staying in Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘If Yahweh will indeed let me return to Jerusalem, then I will worship Yahweh.’ ” 9 Then the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he got up and went to Hebron. 10 Then Absalom sent scouts throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “When you hear the sound of the trumpet, you shall shout ‘Absalom has become king in Hebron!’ ” 11 Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom as invited guests, going in their innocence as they did not know anything. 12 Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, the advisor of David, from his city Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. The conspiracy grew in strength, and the people were going and increasing with Absalom. 13 Then the messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.” 14 Then David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, “Get up and let us flee, for there will be no escape for us from Absalom! Hurry to go, otherwise he will come quickly and overtake us! And he will bring disaster on us and evil! He will attack the city with the edge of the sword!” 15 Then the servants of the king said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king chooses, your servants are ready to act!” 16 The king went out with all his household following him, but the king left behind ten concubines to look after the house. 17 So the king went out with all the people following him, and they stopped at the last house. 18 All his servants were passing by him: all of the Kerethites and all of the Pelethites and all of the Gittites—six hundred men who had followed him from Gath—passing before the king. 19 The king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why are you also coming with us? Return and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner; moreover, you are an exile. You are far from your place. 20 Yesterday when you came and today, I have caused you to wander by going with us. Now I am going to where I am going; return and let your brothers return. May loyal love and faithfulness be with you.” 21 But Ittai answered the king and said, “As Yahweh lives and my lord the king lives, surely in the place wherever my lord the king shall be, if for death or if for life, surely there your servant will be.” 22 Then David said to Ittai, “Go and pass over.” So Ittai the Gittite passed over and all his men and all of the little children who were with him. 23 All of the land was weeping with a loud voice as all the people were passing by and the king was crossing through the Wadi Kidron, and all the people were passing on the road to the wilderness. 24 Suddenly Zadok was there, and all of the Levites with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set the ark of God down, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people passed out of the city. 25 The king said to Zadok, “Let the ark of God return to the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Yawheh, he will let me return and let me see him in his dwelling place. 26 But if he says, ‘I take no pleasure in you,’ then I am ready. Let him do to me that which is good in his eyes. 27 Then the king said to Zadok the priest, “Are you a seer? Return to the city in peace, with Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons with you. 28 See, I am waiting at the fords of the wilderness until a word comes from you all to inform me.” 29 So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and they remained there. 30 Now David was going up on the Ascent of the Olives, weeping as he went, with his head covered and going barefoot. All the people who were with him each covered their head and wept as they went. 31 Now David was told, “Ahithophel was among the conspirators with Absalom.” Then David said, “Please frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel, O Yahweh.” 32 It happened that as David was coming up to the summit where he used to worship God, suddenly Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him. His coat was torn and dirt was on his head. 33 David said to him, “If you move on with me, you will be a burden to me, 34 but if you want to return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I am your servant, O king. I used to be a servant of your father, but from then and now I will be your servant,’ then you can frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel for me. 35 Will not Zadok and Abiathar the priests be with you there? It shall be that all the words you hear from the house of the king you shall tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 36 Look, there with them are their two sons, Ahimaaz of Zadok and Jonathan of Abiathar. You shall send to me by means of them all the words that you hear.” 37 So Hushai the friend of David came to the city as Absalom was entering Jerusalem. 1 Now David passed a little from beyond the summit, and suddenly Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him with a pair of saddled donkeys; on them were two hundred loaves of bread and a hundred raisin cakes, with a hundred summer fruits and a skin of wine. 2 The king said to Ziba, “What do you want to accomplish by bringing these?” And Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on; the bread and the summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for the faint in the wilderness to drink. 3 Then the king said, “Where is the son of your lord?” And Ziba said to the king, “He is living in Jerusalem for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel shall return the kingdom of my father to me.’ ” 4 The king said to Ziba, “Look, all that was Mephibosheth’s is yours.” Ziba said, “I hereby do obeisance; may I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king.” 5 King David came up to Bahurim and suddenly a man from there was coming out from the family of the house of Saul, and his name was Shimei the son of Gera. He was cursing as he came out. 6 And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David and at all the people and at all the mighty warriors on his right and on his left. 7 Shimei said while cursing him, “Go out, go out, you man of bloodshed, you man of wickedness. 8 Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the household of Saul whom you have supplanted as king, and Yahweh has given the kingship into the hand of Absalom your son. Look, you are in disaster for you are a man of blood.” 9 Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.” 10 The king said, “What do we have in common, sons of Zeruiah? If he curses because Yahweh has said to him ‘Curse David,’ who can say, “Why have you done this?” 11 David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Look, my son who came out of my loins is seeking my life. Now as far as this Benjaminite, leave him alone and let him curse, for Yahweh has spoken to him. 12 Perhaps Yahweh will look in my eye and repay good for me in place of his curse this day. 13 Then David and his men went on the road, with Shimei going on the side of the hill beside him, cursing as he went. He threw stones beside him and threw dust in the air. 14 When the king and all of the people who were with him arrived, he was weary, so he recovered there. 15 Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, had come to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. 16 When Hushai the Arkite the friend of David came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king, long live the king!” 17 Absalom said to Hushai, “This is your loyal love with your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?” 18 Then Hushai said to Absalom, “No, rather, whom Yahweh and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, to him I will be, and with him I will remain. 19 Furthermore, for whom have I served? Is it not in the presence of his son that I have served before your father? So shall I serve you!” 20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your advice. What shall we do?” 21 And Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go to the concubines of your father whom he left behind to watch over the house, then all of Israel will hear that you made yourself odious to your father, and all of your followers will be motivated!” 22 Then they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he went in to the concubines of his father before the eyes of all Israel. 23 The counsel that Ahithophel gave in those days was regarded as when a man inquired of the word of God, so all the counsel of Ahithophel was esteemed both by David and by Absalom.

2 Samuel,"1 Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Please let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will set out and pursue after David tonight. 2 I will come upon him while he is weary and weak. I will startle him, and all of the people who are with him will flee. Then I will strike down the king while he is alone. 3 Then I will return all the people to you; when all have returned, the man whom you are seeking will be dead, but all the people will be safe.” 4 The word was right in the eyes of Absalom and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel. 5 Then Absalom said, “Please call also for Hushai the Arkite, and let us hear what he has to say also.” 6 So Hushai came to Absalom, who said to him, “Shall we do according to this word that Ahithophel has spoken? If not, then you tell us.” 7 Then Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel gave is not good at this time.” 8 Hushai continued, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty warriors and they are enraged as a bear robbed of her offspring in the field. Your father is a man of war, so he will not spend the night with the troops. 9 Now he has hidden himself in one of the caves or in one of the places. At the moment he falls on them the first time, whoever hears the report will say, ‘There has been a defeat among the people who follow after Absalom.’ 10 And he is also a valiant warrior, whose heart is like the heart of the lion. He will certainly melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty warrior and those who are with him are valiant warriors. 11 I give the advice that all of Israel from Dan to Beersheba should be completely gathered to you, as the sand which is on the seashore for abundance, with you personally going into the battle. 12 Then we will come to him in one of the places where he may be found, and we shall come upon him as the dew falls on the ground. He and all the men who are with him will not survive, not even one! 13 Even if he withdraws to a city, all Israel will bring up ropes to that city, and they will drag him away to the valley until there is not even a pebble to be found.” 14 Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than the advice of Ahithophel.” (Now Yahweh had ordained to frustrate the good counsel of Ahithophel in order for Yahweh to bring misery upon Absalom). 15 Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Thus and so Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, but thus and so I have advised. 16 So then, send quickly and tell David, ‘Don’t spend the night at the fords of the wilderness! Moreover, by all means cross over lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.’ ” 17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel, so a servant girl used to go and tell them, then they would go and tell King David, for they were not able to be seen coming to the city. 18 But a young man saw them and told Absalom, so both of them went quickly and came to the house of a man at Bahurim. Now he had a well in his courtyard, so they went down there. 19 Then the woman took and spread a covering over the opening of the well; then she spread out dried grain on it, so nothing was discovered. 20 When the servants of Absalom came to the woman at the house, they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And she said to them, “They crossed over the brook of water.” So they searched but could not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem. 21 After they left, they came up from the well and went and told King David. They said to David, “Set out and cross over the water quickly, for thus Ahithophel has advised against you.” 22 So David and all the people who were with him set out, and they crossed over the Jordan until morning light until there was no one missing who had not crossed over the Jordan. 23 When Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled the donkey, and he set out and went up to his house in his city. After he set his house in order, he hanged himself, and he died and was buried in the tomb of his ancestors. 24 Now David had come to Mahanaim, and Absalom had crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 25 Absalom had appointed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who had married Abigail the daughter of Nahash the sister of Zeruiah, the mother of Joab. 26 Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. 27 Just as David had arrived in Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites and Makir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim 28 brought beds and basins and objects of pottery, as well as wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, 29 honey, curds, sheep, cheese, and cattle for David and for the people who were with him to eat. For they had thought, “The troops are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.” 1 Then David mustered the people who were with him, and he appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. 2 David sent forth a third of the troops under the command of Joab, and a third under the command of Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the remaining third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the troops, “I, even I, will certainly go out with you.” 3 Then the troops said, “You will not go out, for if we must flee, then they will not care about us; even if half of us die, they will not care about us, but now, you are like ten thousand of us. And so then, it is better for us that you be in the city to help.” 4 The king said to them, “I will do what seems good in your eyes.” So the king stood at the side of the gate while all of the troops went out by hundreds and by thousands. 5 The king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “With respect to the young man Absalom, deal gently for me.” And all the troops heard when the king ordered all of the commanders concerning the matter of Absalom. 6 The army went out to the field to meet Israel, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim. 7 The army of Israel was defeated there before the servants of David, and the defeat there was great on that day: twenty thousand. 8 The battle there was spreading over the surface of all the land, and the forest devoured more among the army than the sword did on that day. 9 Absalom was found in the presence of the servants of David as he was riding on the mule. The mule went under the thicket of the great oak tree, and his head was caught in the tree. He was left hanging between heaven and earth, and the mule which was under him went on. 10 When a certain man saw it, he told Joab, and he said, “Look, I saw Absalom hanging in the oak tree!” 11 Then Joab said to the man who was telling him, “Look, if you saw, why did you not strike him down to the ground there? I would have gladly given you ten pieces of silver and a leather belt.” 12 The man said to Joab, “Even if I felt the weight of a thousand pieces of silver in my palms, I would not have sent my hand against the son of the king, for in our ears the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Whoever you may be, protect the young man Absalom.’ 13 If I had dealt treacherously against his life, and there is not any matter hidden from the king, you would have presented yourself aloof.” 14 Joab said, “No longer will I wait in your presence.” Then he took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak tree. 15 Then ten of the young men who bore the weapons of Joab surrounded him and struck and killed Absalom. 16 Then Joab blew on the trumpet and the troops returned from pursuing after Israel, for Joab kept back the troops. 17 They took Absalom and they threw him into the large pit in the forest and raised a very great heap of stones over him. Then all of Israel fled, each to his tent. 18 (Now Absalom had taken and set up for himself in his lifetime a stone pillar that is in the valley of the king, because he said, “I have no son in order to remember my name,” and he called the stone pillar by his name. It is called the monument of Absalom until this day). 19 Now Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Please let me run and bring the good news to the king that Yahweh has vindicated him from the hand of his enemies.” 20 Joab said to him, “You will not be a man bringing good news this day! You may bring good news on another day, but today you will not be bringing good news because the king’s son is dead.” 21 Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen”; then the Cushite bowed down to Joab and ran off. 22 Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again said to Joab, “Come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite.” Joab asked, “Why are you wanting to run, my son, when for you there is no messenger’s reward?” 23 “Come what may, I want to run.” He said to him, “Run,” so Ahimaaz ran on the road on the plain, and he passed the Cushite. 24 Now David was sitting between the two gates, and the sentinel went up to the roof of the gate by the wall and he lifted up his eyes and watched, and look, a man was running by himself. 25 The sentry called and told the king, and the king said, “If he is alone, good news is in his mouth.” He kept coming closer. 26 Then the sentinel saw another man running, so the sentinel called to the gatekeeper and said, “Look, a man running alone.” The king said, “This one also is bringing good news.” 27 The sentinel said, “I am seeing that the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zakok.” The king said, “He is a good man; he will come, for good news.” 28 Then Ahimaaz called and said to the king, “Peace.” He bowed down to the king with his face to the ground, and he said, “May Yahweh your God be blessed, who has delivered the men who raised their hand against my lord the king.” 29 The king said, “Is it peace for the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz said, “I saw the great commotion when Joab the servant of the king sent your servant, but I do not know what it was all about.” 30 Then the king said, “Turn aside, take your place here,” so he turned aside and waited. 31 Suddenly the Cushite arrived and said, “May my lord the king receive the good news, for Yahweh has vindicated you today from the power of all who stood up against you.” 32 The king said to the Cushite, “Is it peace for the young man Absalom?” Then the Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you to harm you be like the young man!” 33 The king was upset, and he went up to the upper room of the gate and wept. He said as he went, “My son, Absalom, my son, my son, Absalom. If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son.” ","2 Samuel 17,18",http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/2-samuel-17-18-301208/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-09-28_2-samuel-17-18_20120918142503.mp3
2 Samuel,"1 And it was told to Joab that the king was weeping and he mourned over Absalom, 2 so the victory turned to mourning on that day for all the army, because they had heard that day, “The king is grieving over his son.” 3 The army came secretly into the city on that day because the army was disgraced when they fled in the battle, 4 and because the king had covered his face and cried with a loud voice, “My son, Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son.” 5 Then Joab came to the king’s house and said, “Today you have humiliated the faces of all of your servants who have saved your life this day, and the life of your sons and your daughters, the life of your wives, and the life of your concubines, 6 by loving those who hate you and hating those who love you. Indeed, you have made clear this day that you have no regard for your commanders or officers, for I have realized today that were Absalom alive, and all of us were dead, then that would have been right in your eyes! 7 So then, get up and go out and speak kindly to your servants, for I swear by Yahweh, if you do not go out, no man will lodge this night with you, and this disaster will be greater for you than any disaster that has come upon you from your childhood until now!” 8 So the king got up and he sat in the gate, and they told all the army, “Look, the king is sitting in the gate.” Then all the army came before the king; whereas all of Israel had fled, each to his tent. 9 Then it happened that all the people were disputing among all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and he saved us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled from the land because of Absalom. 10 Now Absalom whom we anointed as king over us has died in the battle; so then, why are you taking no action to restore the king?” 11 Then King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah: ‘Why are you last to bring back the king to his house? The talk of all Israel has come to the king in his house. 12 My brothers, you are my bones and you are my flesh. Why should you be the last to bring back the king?’ 13 To Amasa you shall say: ‘Are you not my bones and my flesh? May God punish me if you are not the commander of my army before me forever, in place of Joab.’ ” 14 So he turned the heart of all the men of Judah as one man, and they sent word to the king, “Return, you and all your servants.” 15 Then the king returned and he came to the Jordan; Judah had come to Gilgal to come to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan. 16 Then Shimei the son of Gera, the son of the Benjaminite, who was from Bahurim quickly came down with the men of Judah to meet King David, 17 and a thousand men were with him from Benjamin. Too, Ziba the servant of the household of Saul and fifteen of his sons and twenty of his servants were with him, and they rushed to the Jordan before the king. 18 The crossing took place to bring the household of the king over and to do good in his eyes. Then Shimei the son of Gera fell before the king when he crossed over the Jordan, 19 and he said to the king, “May not my lord hold me guilty, and may you not remember how your servant did wrong on the day that my lord the king went out from Jerusalem, by taking it to heart! 20 For your servant knows that I have sinned; look, I have come this day as the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.” 21 Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah responded and said, “Because of this, should not Shimei be put to death, for he cursed the anointed one of Yahweh?” 22 Then David said, “What is it to me or to you, sons of Zeruiah, that you should be an adversary today? Should anyone be put to death in Israel? Do I not know today that I am king over Israel?” 23 Then the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die,” and so the king swore to him. 24 Now, Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; he had not taken care of his feet nor trimmed his moustache nor washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he came back in peace. 25 It happened that when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?” 26 Then he said, “My lord the king, my servant deceived me, for your servant had said, ‘Let me saddle the donkey that I may ride on her and go with the king,’ for your servant is lame. 27 But he slandered against your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like the angel of God; do as you see fit..” 28 For there was no one in all the house of my father who were not doomed to death before my lord the king, but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. Do I have any righteousness any longer except to cry out to the king?” 29 Then the king said to him, “Why should you speak any more about the matter? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land.” 30 Then Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him take the whole thing, since my lord the king has come safely to his house.” 31 Then Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and crossed with the king over the Jordan to escort him through the Jordan. 32 Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years old. Now he had provided the king with food while he was staying at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. 33 The king said to Barzillai, “You cross over with me, and I will provide for you to dwell with me in Jerusalem.” 34 Then Barzillai said to the king, “What are the days of the years of my life, that I should go with the king to Jerusalem? 35 I am eighty years old today. Can I discern between good and bad? Or can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Or can I still hear the voice of singing men and women? Why should your servant be a burden any longer to my lord the king? 36 Your servant shall go over the Jordan with the king a little way, but why should the king recompense me with this reward? 37 Please let your servant return, and let me die in my city in the tomb of my father and my mother. Here is your servant Kimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him that which is good in your eyes.” 38 The king said, “Let Kimham go over with me, and I will do for him the good in your eyes, and all that you desire of me I will do for you.” 39 Then all the people crossed over the Jordan, and the king crossed and kissed Barzillai and blessed him; then he returned to his place. 40 The king went over to Gilgal, and Kimham went over with him. All the people of Judah went over with the king, and half of the people of Israel too. 41 Suddenly, all the men of Israel were coming to the king. They said to the king, “Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen away and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, with all the men of David?” 42 Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is my close relative! Why are you this angry over this matter? Have we by any means eaten anything from the king? Did we take by any means anything that was not ours?” 43 Then the people of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, “I have ten times as much in the king, moreover in David I have more than you. Why did you treat me with contempt by not giving me first chance to bring back my king?” But the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the word of the men of Israel. 1 Now a man of wickedness was found there whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. He blew the horn and said, “There is no share for us in David, and there is no inheritance for us in the son of Jesse; each to his tents, O Israel!” 2 Then all the men of Israel went up from following after David, following instead after Sheba the son of Bicri, but the men of Judah stuck to their king from the Jordan up to Jerusalem. 3 David went up to his house in Jerusalem, then the king took the ten concubines whom he had left to look after the house, and he put them under confinement. However, he provided for them, but he did not sleep with them. So they were confined until the day of their death, like a lifetime of widowhood. 4 Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon for me the men of Judah within three days, and be here yourself.” 5 So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he tarried more than the appointed time which he had set for him. 6 Then David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bicri will do us more harm than Absalom. You take the servants of your lord and pursue after him, lest he find fortified cities for himself and escape from us.” 7 Then the men of Joab, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty warriors went out after him; they went out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba the son of Bicri. 8 They were near the big rock that is in Gibeon, and Amasa came before them. Joab was dressed in his military clothing, with a utility belt on him and a sword strapped to his waist in its scabbard. Now he went out, and it fell out. 9 Then Joab said to Amasa, “Is it peace, O you my brother?” Then the right hand of Joab took hold of the beard of Amasa as if to kiss him. 10 Now Amasa was not on his guard against the sword that was in Joab’s hand, and he struck him with it into the stomach, and his entrails poured out to the ground. He did not strike him again, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bicri. 11 A young man stood over him, from the young men of Joab, and he said, “Whoever takes delight in Joab and whoever is for David, follow after Joab.” 12 Now Amasa was wallowing in the blood in the middle of the highway; when the man saw that all the people stood there, he turned Amasa over from the highway into the field, and he threw a garment over him because he had seen that all who had come by him had stopped. 13 After he was removed from the highway, all the men passed by after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of Bicri. 14 (He had passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel and Beth Maacah; now all of the Berites had been treated badly, so they also followed after him.) 15 And they came and besieged him in Abel Beth Maacah. They threw up a siege ramp against the city, and they stood against the ramparts. And all the army who were with Joab were battering to cause the wall to fall. 16 Then a wise woman from the city called out, “Listen, listen! Please speak to Joab to come near here so that I may speak to you.” 17 Then he came near to her, and the woman asked, “Are you Joab?” And he said, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your servant.” He said, “I am listening.” 18 Then she said, “In former times, they would always say, ‘By all means, let them inquire in Abel,’ and so they settled things. 19 I am one of the faithful representatives of Israel. You are seeking to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow the inheritance of Yahweh?” 20 Then Joab answered and said, “Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow or I should destroy. 21 That is not the matter. But a man from the mountains of Ephraim, whose name is Sheba the son Bicri, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Give only him to us, and I will depart from the city.” The woman said to Joab, “Look, his head is being thrown down to you over the wall.” 22 The woman went to all of the people with her wise plan, so they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bicri and threw it to Joab. Then he blew the horn and dispersed from the city, each to his tent. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king. 23 Now Joab was over all the army of Israel and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Carites and over the Pelethites. 24 Adoram was over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder. 25 Shiya was secretary, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests. 26 Also Ira the Jairite was priest for David.

Judges,"1 The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over and make war against the Ammonites, and why did you not call us to go with you? We will burn down your house over you with fire.” 2 And Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were engaged in great conflict with the Ammonites; I called you, but you did not deliver me from their hand. 3 I saw that you would not deliver us; I risked my own life, and I crossed over to the Ammonites, and Yahweh gave them into my hand. Why have you come up to me this day to fight against me?” 4 Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead, and he made war with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh.” 5 Then Gilead captured the fords of the Jordan from Ephraim, and whenever a fugitive of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead said to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” When he said, “No,” 6 they said to him, “Please say Shibboleth,” and if he said, “Sibboleth”—because he could not pronounce it correctly—they grabbed him and executed him at the fords of Jordan. At that time forty-two thousand from Ephraim fell. 7 Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. 8 After him Ibzan from Bethlehem judged Israel. 9 He had thirty sons. He gave his thirty daughters away in marriage outside his clan and brought in from outside thirty young women for his sons. He judged Israel for seven years. 10 Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem. 11 After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years. 12 Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. 13 After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons that rode on seventy male donkeys. He judged Israel for eight years. 15 Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon, in the land of Ephraim in the hill country of the Amalekites. 1 And again, the Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and Yahweh gave them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. 2 There was a certain man from Zorah, from the tribe of the Danites, and his name was Manoah; his wife was infertile and did not bear children. 3 And an angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman, and he said to her, “Behold, you are infertile and have not borne children, but you will conceive and bear a son. 4 So then, be careful and do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, 5 because you will conceive and bear a son. No razor will touch his head, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth. And it is he who will begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.” 6 And the woman came and told her husband, saying, “A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him from where he came, and he did not tell me his name. 7 And he said to me, ‘Look, you will conceive and bear a son, so then, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, for the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth until the day of his death.’ ” 8 Then Manoah prayed to Yahweh and said, “Excuse me, my Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent again come to us and teach us what we should do concerning the boy who will be born.” 9 And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and an angel of God came again to the woman; she was sitting in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her. 10 The woman quickly ran and told her husband, and she said to him, “Look! The man who came to me the other day appeared to me.” 11 So Manoah got up and went after his wife, and he came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man that spoke to the woman?” And he said, “I am.” 12 And Manoah said to him, “Now when your words come true, what will be the boy’s manner of life and work?” 13 And the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, “Let the woman be attentive to all that I said. 14 She should not eat of anything that comes from the vine, or drink wine or strong drink, or eat anything unclean; she should keep all that I commanded.” 15 And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, “Please stay, and let us prepare a young goat for you.” 16 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, “If you keep me, I will not eat your food, but if you prepare a burnt offering for Yahweh, you can offer it (for Manoah did not know that he was an angel of Yahweh).” 17 And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, “What is your name so that when your words come true we may honor you?” 18 But the angel of Yahweh said to him, “Why do you ask my name? It is too wonderful.” 19 And Manoah took the young goat and the grain offering, and he offered it to Yahweh on the rock, to the one who performs miracles. And Manoah and his wife were watching. 20 And when the flame went up toward the heaven from the altar, the angel of Yahweh went up in the flame of the altar to heaven while Manoah and his wife were watching. And they fell on their faces to the ground. 21 The angel of Yahweh did not appear again to Manoah and his wife, and then Manoah knew that he was a messenger of Yahweh. 22 And Manoah said to his wife, “We will certainly die because we have seen God.” 23 But his wife said to him, “If Yahweh wanted to kill us he would not have taken from our hand the burnt offering and the grain offering, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us things such as these.” 24 The woman bore a son, and she called him Samson; the boy grew big, and Yahweh blessed him. 25 And the Spirit of Yahweh began to stir him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.

Joshua,"1 After the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh, Yahweh said to Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses, saying, 2 “My servant Moses is dead. Get up and cross the Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the Israelites. 3 Every place that the soles of your feet will tread, I have given it to you, as I promised to Moses. 4 From the wilderness and the Lebanon, up to the great river, the river Euphrates, all of the land of the Hittites, and up to the great sea in the west, will be your territory. 5 No one will stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so will I be with you; I will not fail you, and I will not forsake you. 6 Be strong and courageous, for you will give the people this land as an inheritance that I swore to their ancestors to give them. 7 Only be strong and very courageous to observe diligently the whole law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn aside from it, to the right or left, so that you may succeed wherever you go. 8 The scroll of this law will not depart from your mouth; you will meditate on it day and night so that you may observe diligently all that is written in it. For then you will succeed in your ways and prosper. 9 Did I not command you? Be strong and courageous! Do not fear or be dismayed, for Yahweh your God is with you wherever you go.” ",Joshua 1:1-9,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/joshua-11-9-280138/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-05-23_joshua-11-9_20120510000505.mp3
Joshua,"10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 11 “Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people: ‘Prepare your provisions; in three days you are to cross the Jordan to go possess the land that Yahweh your God is giving you to possess.’ ” 12 To the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said, 13 “Remember the word that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, saying, ‘Yahweh your God is giving rest to you, and he is giving you this land.’ 14 Your wives, your little children, and your livestock, they will remain in the land that Moses gave to you beyond the Jordan. All of the best fighting men will cross armed in front of your families; they will help you 15 until Yahweh gives rest to your families as well as to you. They will take possession of the land that Yahweh your God is giving to them. Then you will return to your own land and take possession of it, the land that Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan to the east.” 16 And they answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you will send us we will go. 17 Just as we obeyed Moses, so will we obey you. Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses. 18 Whoever rebels against your orders and does not obey your words according to what you commanded us will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.” 1 Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two men from Acacia Grove as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” So they went, and entered the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and spent the night there. 2 The king of Jericho was told, “Look, some men from the Israelites have come here tonight to search out the land.” 3 And the king of Jericho sent for Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who came to you, the ones who have entered your house, for they have come to search out the whole land.” 4 But the woman took the two men and hid them. And she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. 5 And when it was time to shut the gate for the night, the men left, and I do not know where they went. Chase after them quickly, for you may catch up to them.” 6 (But she had taken them to the roof and had hidden them in the stalks of flax that she had spread out on the roof.) 7 So the men chased after them on the way to the Jordan at the fords; and they shut the gate behind the pursuers that had gone out after them. 8 Before they went to sleep, she came up to them on the roof ",Joshua 1:10-2:8,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/joshua-11028-280139/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-05-24_joshua-11028_20120510000658.mp3
Joshua,"9 and said to the men, “I know that Yahweh has given you the land, and that dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away in fear because of your presence. 10 For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you went out from Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed. 11 We heard this, and our hearts melted, and no courage was left in anyone because of your presence. For Yahweh your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth below. 12 So then please swear to me by Yahweh, because I have shown loyalty to you, and you will also show loyalty to my family. You must give me a sign of good faith, 13 and you will spare my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all that belongs to them; you will deliver our lives from death.” 14 And the men said to her, “Our lives for yours. If you do not report this business of ours, we will show you loyalty and faithfulness when Yahweh gives us the land.” 15 Then she lowered them with a rope through the window, as her house was on the outer side of the wall, and she was residing in the wall. 16 And she said to them, “Go to the mountain, so that the pursuers will not find you, and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers return, and afterward you may go on your way.” 17 The men said to her, “We will be released from this oath of yours that you made us swear. 18 When we come to the land, you must tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and you must gather your father and mother, and your brothers, and your whole family to your house. 19 If anyone goes outside the doors of your house, they will be responsible for their own death, and we will be innocent. Anyone who will be with you in the house, we will be responsible for their death if a hand is laid on them. 20 But if you report this business of ours, we will be released from your oath that you made us swear.” 21 And she said, “According to your word it will be.” Then she sent them away, and they went, and she tied the scarlet cord in the window. 22 They departed and came to the mountain, and they stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers searched all along the way but did not find them. 23 The two men returned and went down from the mountain, and they crossed over and came to Joshua son of Nun, and they told him everything that happened to them. 24 They said to Joshua, “Surely Yahweh has given all the land into our hand; also, all the inhabitants of the land melt away in fear because of our presence.” 1 Joshua rose early in the morning, and they set out from Acacia Grove. And they came up to the Jordan, he and all the Israelites, and they spent the night there before they crossed over. 2 At the end of the three days the officers passed through the midst of the camp, 3 and they commanded the people: “When you see the Levitical priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God you must set out from your place and go after it. 4 But there will be a distance between you and it of about two thousand cubits in measurement. Do not come near it, so that you may know the way that you must go, for you have not passed on this way before.” 5 And Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves, because tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders in your midst.” 6 And Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people.” And they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people. 7 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “This day I will begin exalting you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that I was with Moses, and I will be with you. 8 You will command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘At the moment that you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you will stand still in the Jordan.’ ” 9 And Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your God.” 10 Joshua said, “By this you will know that the living God is in your midst, and he will certainly drive out the Canaanites from before you, and the Hittites, Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites. 11 Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is about to cross over ahead of you into the Jordan. 12 So then, take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe. 13 When the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the ark of Yahweh, Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off upstream, and they will stand still in one heap. 14 And it happened, when the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant were ahead of the people. 15 When those carrying the ark came up to the Jordan, and the priests carrying the ark dipped their feet in the edge of the water (the Jordan was flowing over its banks during all the days of harvest), 16 the waters flowing down from above stood still; they stood up in one heap very far from Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, while the waters flowing down to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho. 17 And the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh stood firmly on the dry land in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground, until all the nation finished crossing the Jordan. 1 After all the nation finished crossing the Jordan, Yahweh said to Joshua, 2 “Take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe, 3 and command them, saying, ‘Take for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where the priests’ feet stood firmly, and bring them over with you, and set them up in the place where you will camp tonight.’ ” 4 So Joshua summoned the twelve men whom he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe. 5 And Joshua said to them, “Cross over before the ark of Yahweh your God to the middle of the Jordan, and each one of you lift up a stone on your shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, 6 so that this may be a reminder among you. When your children ask in the future, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’ 7 you will say to them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off from before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones will be as a memorial for the Israelites for eternity.” 8 Thus the Israelites did as Joshua commanded. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan as Yahweh told Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, and they carried them over with them to the camp, and they put them there. 9 Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests carrying the ark of the covenant stood, and they are there to this day. 10 The priests carrying the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything that Yahweh commanded Joshua to tell the people was finished, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. And the people hastily crossed over. 11 And it happened, when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of Yahweh and the priests crossed over in front of the people. 12 The children of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the Israelites, as Moses told them. 13 About forty thousand armed for fighting crossed over before the presence of Yahweh to the plains of Jericho for battle. 14 On that day Yahweh exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they respected him as they respected Moses all the days of his life. 15 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, saying, 16 “Command the priests carrying the ark of the testimony to come up from the Jordan.” 17 So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.” 18 And it happened that when the priests carrying the ark came up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet touched dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and flowed over all its banks as before.

Joshua,"18 And it happened that when the priests carrying the ark came up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet touched dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and flowed over all its banks as before. 19 And the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the eastern edge of Jericho. 20 And those twelve stones that they took from the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal. 21 And he said to the Israelites, “When your children ask in the future their parents, ‘What is the meaning of these stones?’ 22 you will let your children know by saying, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.’ 23 For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you, until you had crossed, just as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up before us until we had crossed over, 24 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of Yahweh is strong, so that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.” 1 And it happened, when all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea heard that Yahweh dried up the waters of the Jordan in front of the Israelites until they crossed over, their hearts melted, and there was no courage left in them because of the presence of the Israelites. 2 At that time Yahweh said to Joshua, “Make for yourself knives of flint, and circumcise the Israelites a second time.” 3 So Joshua made knives of flint, and he circumcised the Israelites at the hill of the foreskins. 4 This is the reason why Joshua circumcised all the people: all the males who went out from Egypt, all the warriors, died in the wilderness as they went out from Egypt on the journey. 5 For all the people who left were circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness on the journey after they left from Egypt were not circumcised. 6 For forty years the Israelites traveled in the wilderness until all the nation, the warriors that left Egypt, perished, because they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh. To them Yahweh swore that they would not see the land that he swore to their ancestors to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 7 And it was their children whom he raised in their place that Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the journey. 8 And it happened, when all the nation had finished circumcising, they remained where they were in the camp until they recovered. 9 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you.” Therefore, the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day. 10 And the Israelites camped at Gilgal, and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, on the plains of Jericho. 11 On the next day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate from the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and roasted corn. 12 And the manna ceased the day after, when they started eating the produce of the land, and there was no longer manna for the Israelites. They ate from the crop of the land of Canaan in that year. 13 And it happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, he looked up, and he saw a man standing opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said, “Are you with us, or with our adversaries?” 14 And he said, “Neither. I have come now as the commander of Yahweh’s army.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and he bowed down and said to him, “What is my lord commanding his servant?” 15 The commander of Yahweh’s army said to Joshua, “Take off your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.

Joshua,"1 Now Jericho was shut up inside and out because of the presence of the Israelites; no one was going out or coming in. 2 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Look, I am giving Jericho into your hand, its king and the soldiers of the army. 3 You will march around the city, all the warriors circling the city once; you will do so for six days. 4 And seven priests will bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day you will march around the city seven times, and the priests will blow on the trumpets. 5 And when they blow long on the horn of the ram, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people will shout with a great war cry, and the wall of the city will fall flat, and the people will charge, each one straight ahead.” 6 So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry the trumpets of the rams’ horns before the ark of Yahweh.” 7 And he said to the people, “Go forward and march around the city, and let the armed men pass before the ark of Yahweh. 8 And when Joshua spoke to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the presence of Yahweh went forward and they blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed behind them. 9 And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they were blowing the trumpets. 10 But Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You will not shout, and you will not let your voice be heard; a word will not go out from your mouth until the day I say to you ‘Shout!’ Then you will shout.” 11 And the ark of Yahweh went around the city, circling once, and they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp. 12 Then Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh. 13 The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of the rams’ horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually, and they blew on the trumpets. And the armed men went before them, and the rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh, while the trumpets blew continually. 14 And they marched around the city once on the second day, and they returned to the camp. They did this for six days. 15 Then on the seventh day they rose early at dawn, and they marched around the city in this manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times. 16 And at the seventh time the priests blew on the trumpets, and Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For Yahweh has given you the city. 17 The city and all that is in it will be devoted to Yahweh; only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in the house will live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. 18 As for you, keep away from the things devoted to destruction so that you do not take them and bring about your own destruction, making the camp of Israel an object for destruction, bringing trouble upon it. 19 But all of the silver and gold, and the items of bronze and iron, are holy to Yahweh, and they must go to Yahweh’s treasury.” 20 So the people shouted, and they blew on the trumpets. And when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, they raised a great shout, and the wall fell flat. The people charged, each one straight ahead into the city, and they captured it. 21 And they utterly destroyed by the edge of the sword all who were in the city, both men and women, young and old, ox, sheep, and donkey. 22 Then Joshua said to the two men who spied on the land, “Go to the prostitute’s house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, just as you swore to her.” 23 So the young men who were spies went and brought Rahab and her father and mother, her brothers, and all who were with her. And they brought all her family out and set them outside the camp of Israel. 24 And they burned the city and all that was in it with fire; they put only the silver and gold, and the items of copper and iron, into the treasury of the house of Yahweh. 25 But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute and her family and all who were with her, and she has lived in the midst of Israel until this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 26 And Joshua swore at that time, saying, “Cursed is anyone before Yahweh who gets up and builds Jericho, this city. At the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.” 27 So Yahweh was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.

Joshua,"1 But the Israelites broke faith concerning the devoted things. Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took from the devoted things; and Yahweh’s anger was kindled against the Israelites. 2 Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven, east of Bethel, and he said to them, “Go up and spy out Ai.” And the men went up and spied out Ai. 3 And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up and attack Ai; only two or three thousand men should go up because they are few. Do not make all the people weary up there.” 4 So about three thousand from the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai. 5 The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, and they chased them from the gate up to Shebarim and killed them on the slope. And the hearts of the people melted and became like water. 6 And Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads. 7 And Joshua said, “Ah, my Lord! Why did you bring this people across the Jordan to give us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content and stayed beyond the Jordan. 8 Please, my Lord! What can I say after Israel has fled from its enemies? 9 The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of this, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the land. What will you do, for your great name?” 10 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why have you fallen on your face? 11 Israel has sinned and transgressed my covenant that I commanded them. They have taken from the devoted things; they have stolen and acted deceitfully, and they have put them among their belongings. 12 The Israelites were unable to stand before their enemies; they fled from their enemies because they have become a thing devoted for destruction. I will be with you no more unless you destroy the devoted things from among you. 13 Get up, sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow. Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: “There are devoted things in your midst, O Israel. You will be unable to stand before you enemies until you remove the devoted things from your midst.” 14 In the morning you will come forward, tribe by tribe, and the tribe that Yahweh will select by lot will come forward by clans, and the clan that Yahweh selects by lot will come forward by families, and the family that Yahweh selects by lot will come forward one by one. 15 The one caught with the devoted things will be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he did a disgraceful thing in Israel.” ’ ” 16 So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought forward Israel, tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected by lot. 17 And he brought forward the clans of Judah and selected the clan of the Zerahites by lot. Then he brought forward the clan of the Zerahites, one by one, and Zabdi was selected by lot. 18 He brought forward his family, one by one, and Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected by lot. 19 And Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please, give glory to Yahweh the God of Israel, and give him a doxology in court. Tell me, please, what you have done; do not hide it from me.” 20 And Achan answered Joshua and said, “It is true. I have sinned against Yahweh the God of Israel, and this is what I did: 21 I saw among the spoil a beautiful robe from Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and one bar of gold that weighed fifty shekels; I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, and the silver is under it.” 22 Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there they were, hidden in his tent, and the silver was under it. 23 And they took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites. And they spread them out before the presence of Yahweh. 24 Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his cattle and donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and everything that was his, and they brought them to the valley of Achor. 25 And Joshua said, “Why did you bring us trouble? Yahweh will bring you trouble on this day.” And all Israel stoned them with stones; and they burned them with fire after they stoned them with stones. 26 Then they placed on top of him a great pile of stones that remains to this day. And Yahweh turned from his burning anger, and thus the name of that place to this day is called the valley of Achor. 1 Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not fear or be dismayed. Take all the fighting men with you and go up immediately to Ai. Look, I am giving into your hand the king of Ai, his city, and his land. 2 You will do to Ai and its king that which you did to Jericho and its king; you may take only its spoils and livestock as booty for yourself. Set for yourself an ambush against the city from behind it.” ",Joshua 7:1-8:2,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/joshua-7182-280143/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-05-30_joshua-7182_20120510001508.mp3
Joshua,"3 So Joshua and all the fighting men went up immediately to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand of the best fighting men and sent them by night. 4 And he commanded them, saying, “Look, you are to lay an ambush against the city from behind. Do not go very far from the city and be ready. 5 Then I and all of the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they go out to meet us as before, we will flee from them. 6 They will come out after us until we draw them away from the city, because they will think, ‘They are fleeing from us as before.’ So we will flee from them. 7 Then you will rise up from the ambush and take possession of the city, for Yahweh your God will give it into your hand. 8 And when you capture the city you will set it on fire as Yahweh commanded. Look, I have commanded you.” 9 So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place of the ambush, and they sat between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai; but Joshua spent the night with the people. 10 Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up with the elders of Israel before the people of Ai. 11 All the fighting men who were with him went up and drew near before the city and camped north of Ai; there was a valley between him and Ai. 12 And he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. 13 So they stationed the forces; all the army was north of the city while the rear guard was west. But Joshua went that night to the middle of the valley. 14 When the king of Ai saw this, the men of the city hurried and rose early and went out to meet Israel for battle—he and all his army—to the meeting place before the Arabah. He did not know that there was an ambush for him behind the city. 15 Then Joshua and all Israel acted like they were beaten before them, and they fled in the direction of the wilderness. 16 All of the people who were in the city were called to pursue after them. As they pursued after Joshua, they were drawn away from the city. 17 Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel; they left the city open and pursued after Israel. 18 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stretch out the sword that is in your hand to Ai, because I will give it into your hand.” And Joshua stretched out the sword that was in his hand to the city. 19 The moment he stretched out his hand, those in the ambush stood up quickly from their place and ran. And they went into the city and captured it, quickly setting the city ablaze with fire. 20 Then the men of Ai looked behind them, and they saw smoke from the city rising to the sky; they had no power to flee this way or that, and the people fleeing the wilderness turned around to the pursuers. 21 And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city was rising; they returned and struck down the men of Ai. 22 Then the others from the city came out to meet them, and they found themselves surrounded by Israel, some on one side, and others on the other side. And they struck them down until no survivor or fugitive was left. 23 But they captured the king of Ai alive, and they brought him to Joshua. 24 When Israel finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of Ai in the open field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when all of them had fallen by the edge of the sword until they all had perished, all Israel returned to Ai and attacked it with the edge of the sword. 25 All the people that fell on that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand—all the inhabitants of Ai. 26 For Joshua did not draw back his hand that was stretched out with the sword until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 27 Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as booty for themselves, according to the word of Yahweh that Joshua commanded. 28 So Joshua burned Ai and made it an everlasting heap of rubbish, a desolate place until this day. 29 The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the time of evening, and as the sun went down Joshua commanded them, and they brought down his dead body from the tree. Then they threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and they raised over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day. 30 Then Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal for Yahweh the God of Israel, 31 as Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded the Israelites, as it is written in the scroll of the law of Moses: “an altar of unhewn stones on which no one has wielded an iron implement.” And they offered burnt offerings on it and sacrificed fellowship offerings. 32 And there Joshua wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written, in the presence of the Israelites. 33 Then all Israel, foreigner as well as native, with the elders, officials, and judges stood on either side of the ark before the priests and the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. Half of them stood in front of Mount Gerizim, and the other half in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses Yahweh’s servant had commanded before to bless the people of Israel. 34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and the curses, according to all that was written in the scroll of the law. 35 There was not a word from all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before the assembly of all Israel, and the women, the little children, and the traveling foreigners among them. 1 Now when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the Shephelah, and on all the coast of the great sea toward Lebanon—the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites—heard of this, 2 they gathered themselves together to fight with one accord against Joshua and Israel. 3 But the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua did to Jericho and Ai, 4 and they acted on their part with cunning: they went and prepared provisions, and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys and old wineskins that were torn and mended. 5 The sandals on their feet were patched and old, their clothes were old, and their food was dry and crumbled. 6 And they went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far land; so then make a covenant with us.” 7 And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you are living among us; how can we make a covenant with you?” 8 They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” And Joshua said to them, “Who are you, and from where do you come?” 9 And they said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far land because of the name of Yahweh your God; we have heard of his reputation, of all that he did in Egypt, 10 and of all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan—to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth. 11 So our elders said to us and all the inhabitants of our land, ‘Take in your hand provisions for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We are your servants; so then make a covenant with us.” ’ 12 This is our bread; it was hot when we took it from our houses as provisions on the day we set out to come to you. But now, look, it is dry and crumbled. 13 These are the wineskins that we filled new, but look, they have burst; and these are our clothes and sandals that have worn out from the very long journey.” 14 So the leaders took from their provisions, but they did not ask direction from Yahweh. 15 And Joshua made peace with them, and he made a covenant with them to allow them to live happily, and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them. 16 And it happened that at the end of three days, after they made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors and living among them. 17 And the Israelites set out and went to their cities on the third day (their cities were Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim). 18 But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against their leaders. 19 But all the leaders of the congregation said, “We have sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel, and so we cannot touch them. 20 This we will do to them: we will let them live so that wrath will not be on us because of the oath we swore to them.” 21 And the leaders said to them, “Let them live.” So they became woodcutters and water carriers for all the congregation, just as the leaders had said to them. 22 And Joshua summoned them and said, “Why have you deceived us saying, ‘We are very far from you’ when you are living among us? 23 Therefore you are cursed; some of you will always be slaves as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.” 24 And they answered Joshua and said, “Because it was told with certainty to your servants that Yahweh your God commanded Moses his servant to give to you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you, so we were very afraid for our lives because of you, and so we did this thing. 25 So then, look, we are in your hand; do with us whatever seems good and right in your eyes.” 26 So he did this to them: he saved them from the hand of the Israelites, and they did not kill them. 27 And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place that he should choose. 1 And it happened that when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua captured Ai and had utterly destroyed it (just as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he did to Ai and its king) and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them, 2 he became very afraid because Gibeon was a very large city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was larger than Ai, and all its men were mighty warriors. 3 So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hohman king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, 4 “Come up and help me, and let us attack Gibeon, because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.” 5 And the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they and all their forces, and they laid siege to Gibeon and made war against it. 6 And the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not abandon your servant. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country have gathered against us.” 7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the fighting men with him, all the best warriors. 8 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for I have given them into your hand; no one will withstand you. 9 Joshua came upon them suddenly by marching up all night from Gilgal. 10 And Yahweh threw them into panic before Israel, who struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah. 11 And as they were fleeing from Israel, they were on the slope of Beth-horon, and Yahweh threw huge stones from the heavens on them as far as Azekah; and more died by the hail stones than those whom the Israelites killed by the sword. 12 Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh, on the day Yahweh gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, and he said in the sight of Israel, “Sun in Gibeon, stand still, and moon, in the valley of Aijalon.” 13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on its enemies. Is it not written in the scroll of Jashar? The sun stood still in the middle of the heaven and was not in haste to set for about a full day. 14 There has not been a day like this before it or after, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought for Israel.

Joshua,"15 And Joshua returned and all Israel with him to the camp at Gilgal. 16 But these five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. 17 And it was told to Joshua, saying, “The five kings were found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.” 18 And Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men in front of it to guard them. 19 But do not stay there; pursue after your enemies and attack them from the rear. Do not allow them to go into their cities, for Yahweh your God has given them into your hand.” 20 When Joshua and the Israelites had finished striking them with a very great blow, until they perished, those of them who survived went into the fortified cities, 21 and all the people returned to the camp safely to Joshua at Makkedah. No one spoke against the Israelites. 22 And Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring to me those five kings from the cave.” 23 And they did so, and brought him these five kings from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. 24 And when they brought these kings to Joshua, Joshua called all the men of Israel and said to the commanders of the fighting men who had gone with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came near and put their feet on their necks. 25 And Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid or dismayed! Be strong and bold, for thus Yahweh will do to all your enemies whom you are about to fight. 26 And after this Joshua struck them down and killed them, and he hanged them on five trees. And they were hanging on the trees until the evening. 27 And it happened at the time of sunset, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they put large stones against the mouth of the cave, which are there to this very day. 28 Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and he struck it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed it and everyone that was in it. He did not leave behind a survivor. So he did to the king of Makkedah just as he did to the king of Jericho. 29 And Joshua passed on, and all of Israel with him, from Makkedah to Libnah, and he fought against Libnah. 30 And Yahweh also gave it into the hand of Israel, and its king and all the people in it he struck with the edge of the sword. He left in it no survivor. He did to its king just as he did to the king of Jericho. 31 And Joshua passed on, and all of Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish, and he laid siege to it and fought against it. 32 And Yahweh gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day. He struck it with the edge of the sword, and everyone in it, just as he did to Libnah. 33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish, and Joshua struck him and his people until he left no survivor behind. 34 And Joshua passed on, and all of Israel with him, from Lachish to Eglon, and they laid siege to it and fought against it. 35 And they captured it on that day, and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the people that were in it on that day he utterly destroyed as he had done to Lachish. 36 And Joshua went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it 37 and captured it, and they struck it with the edge of the sword, its king and all its cities, and all the people that were in it; he left behind no survivor, as he had done to Eglon, and he utterly destroyed it and all the people that were in it. 38 Then Joshua returned to Debir, and all of Israel with him, and they fought against it, 39 and he captured it and its king and all its cities, and they struck them with the the edge of the sword, and they utterly destroyed all the people that were in it; he left behind no survivor, just as he had done to Hebron. Thus he did to Debir and its king what he had done to Libnah and its king. 40 So Joshua struck all the land—the hill country, the Negev, the Shephelah, and the slopes—and all their kings; he left behind no survivor, and all that breathed he utterly destroyed as Yahweh the God of Israel commanded. 41 Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza, and all the land of Goshen up to Gibeon; 42 all of these kings and their land Joshua captured at one time, because Yahweh the God of Israel fought for Israel. 43 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal. 1 And it happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard this, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Acshaph, 2 and to the kings who were in the north in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Kinnereth, in the Shephelah, and in Naphoth Dor in the west, 3 to the Canaanites in the east and west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah. 4 They came out, they and all their armies with them, as a great army like the sand on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots. 5 And all these kings joined forces, and they came and camped together by the waters of Merom to fight with Israel. 6 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid because of their presence, for tomorrow at this time I will hand them over slain to Israel; you will hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.” 7 So Joshua, and all the fighting men with him, came against them suddenly at the waters of Merom, and they attacked them. 8 And Yahweh gave them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them and pursued them up to Great Sidon and Misrephoth Maim, and eastward up to the valley of Mizpeh. And they struck them until they left behind no survivor. 9 And Joshua did to them as Yahweh commanded him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire. 10 Then Joshua turned back at that time, and he captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword, because Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms. 11 He struck all the people that were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left who breathed, and he burned Hazor with fire. 12 And Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, and he utterly destroyed them with the edge of the sword, as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded. 13 Israel did not burn the cities standing on their mounds, except Hazor alone, which Joshua burned. 14 And all the spoil and livestock of these cities the Israelites took as booty; they struck the people with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them—they left behind no one who breathed. 15 Just as Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did; he left nothing undone that Yahweh had commanded Moses. 16 So Joshua took all this land: the hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the Shephelah, the Arabah, and the hill country of Israel and its Shephelah, 17 from Mount Halak that rises to Seir and to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon; he captured all their kings, struck them, and killed them. 18 For many days Joshua made war with all these kings. 19 There was not a city that made peace with the Israelites besides the Hivites and the inhabitants of Gibeon—all were taken in battle. 20 For it was Yahweh that hardened their hearts, to meet Israel in war in order to utterly destroy them without mercy, that they would destroy them just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 21 At that time Joshua came and exterminated the Anakites from the hill country, from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities. 22 None of the Anakites were left in the land of the Israelites; some remained only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod. 23 Joshua took all the land according to all that Yahweh had spoken to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel, according to their tribal divisions, and the land rested from war.

Joshua,"1 The second allotment fell for Simeon, for the tribe of the descendants of Simeon, according to their families. And their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the descendants of Judah. 2 And they had as their inheritance Beersheba, Sheba, Moladah, 3 Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem, 4 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 5 Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah, 6 Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages. 7 Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages, 8 and all the villages that were around these towns up to Baalat-Beor, Ramath of the Negev. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Simeon according to their families. 9 Part of the portion allotted to the descendants of Judah became the inheritance of the descendants of Simeon because the portion for the descendants of Judah was too large for them, so the descendants of Simeon inherited from their inheritance. 10 The third allotment came up for the descendants of Zebulun according to their families. The border of their inheritance went up to Sarid. 11 Their border goes up to the west, to Maralah; it touches Dabbesheth, then the wadi that is opposite Jokneam. 12 It turns from Sarid to the east to the sunrise, to the border of Kislot-Tabor; it continues to Daberath and goes up to Japhia. 13 From there it passes along to the east toward the sunrise, to Gath Hepher and to Eth Kazin, and continuing to Rimmon, it turns to Neah; 14 it changes direction from the north of Hannathon, and it ends at the valley of Yiptah-El; 15 Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem; twelve cities and their villages. 16 This is the inheritance of the descendants of Zebulun according to their families, these cities and their villages. 17 The fourth allotment fell for Issachar, for the descendants of Issachar, according to their families. 18 Their border went to Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, 19 Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 20 Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 21 Remeth, En Gannim, En Haddah, and Beth Pazzez; 22 and the border touches Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh. Its border ends at the Jordan; sixteen cities and their villages. 23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages. 24 The fifth allotment fell for the tribe of the descendants of Asher according to their families. 25 Their border was Helkath, Hali, Beten, Acshaph, 26 Allamelech, Amad, and Mishal; it touches Carmel to the west, and Shihor-Libnat. 27 Then it turns eastward to Beth-dagon and touches Zebulun and the valley of Yiptah-El to the north to Beth Emeck and Neiel; it continues to Cabul from the north, 28 and Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah up to Great Sidon; 29 then the border turns to Ramah, and up to the fortified city of Tyre, where the border turns to Hosah; it ends at the sea, from Hebel to Aczib. 30 Included were Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob; twenty-two cities and their villages. 31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Asher according to their families, these cities and their villages. 32 The sixth allotment fell for the children of Naphtali, for the children of Naphtali according to their families. 33 Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, Adami Nekeb, Jabneel, up to Lakkum; it ends at the Jordan; 34 then the border turns to the west, to Aznoth Tabor, and continues from there to Hukok, and it touches Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and Judah on the east at the Jordan. 35 The fortified cities are Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth, 36 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 37 Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor, 38 Yiron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth-anath, Beth Shemesh; nineteen cities and their villages. 39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages. 40 The seventh lot fell for the tribe of the descendants of Dan according to their families. 41 The border of their inheritance was Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir Shemesh, 42 Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 43 Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 45 Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon, 46 Me Jarkon, Rakkon, with the border opposite Joppa. 47 The border of the descendants of Dan continued beyond them, because the descendants of Dan went up and fought with Lesham, and they captured and struck it with the edge of the sword, and they took possession of it and settled in it; and they called Leshem Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor. 48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Dan according to their families, these cities and their villages. 49 They finished assigning the land according to its borders, and the Israelites gave an inheritance from among them to Joshua son of Nun. 50 According to the commandment of Yahweh, they gave him the city that he requested, Timnath Serah, in the hill country of Ephraim, and he rebuilt the city and settled in it. 51 These are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the tribes, distributed by allotment to the Israelites, at Shiloh before Yahweh at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And they finished dividing the land. 1 And Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying, 2 “Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘Appoint for yourselves cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through the hand of Moses. 3 Anyone who kills a person by accident or unintentionally may flee there; they will be for yourselves a refuge from the avenger of blood. 4 The killer will flee to one of these cities, stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and state his case to the elders of that city; and they will take him into the city and give him a place, and he will dwell among them. 5 And if the avenger of blood pursues after him, they will not hand over the killer into his hand, because he killed his neighbor unintentionally, and he did not hate him previously. 6 The killer will stay in that city until he stands before the congregation for the trial, until the death of the one who is the high priest in those days. Then the killer will return to his city and to his house, to the city from which he fled.’ ” 7 So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 8 Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau, from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in the Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh. 9 These were the cities designated for all the Israelites, and for the foreigners dwelling among them, for anyone that kills a person unintentionally to flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until there is a trial before the congregation.

Joshua,"1 Then the heads of the families of the Levites came to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the families of the tribes of the Israelites. 2 And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “Yahweh commanded through the hand of Moses to give us cities to live in, with their pasturelands for our livestock.” 3 So, by command of Yahweh, the Israelites gave the Levites these cities and their pasturelands from their inheritance. 4 The allotment fell for the families of the Kohathites. The descendants of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, received by lot thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. 5 The remaining descendants of Kohath received by lot ten cities from the families of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 6 The descendants of Gershon received by lot thirteen cities from the families of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, and Naphtali and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan. 7 The descendants of the Merarites according to their families received twelve cities from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun. 8 The Israelites gave to the Levites these cities and their pastureland by lot, just as Yahweh commanded through the hand of Moses. 9 They gave these cities, which are here mentioned by name, from the tribe of the families of Judah and from the tribe of the families of Simeon; 10 and they were for the descendants of Aaron, from the families of the Kohathites, from the descendants of Levi, because the first lot was theirs. 11 And they gave to them Kiriath Arba, Arba being the father of Anak (that is, Hebron), in the hill country of Judah and the pasturelands surrounding it. 12 But the field of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his property. 13 To the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for the killer, and its pasturelands, Libnah and its pasturelands, 14 Jattir and its pasturelands, Eshtemoa and its pasturelands, 15 Holon and its pasturelands, Debir and its pasturelands, 16 Ain and its pasturelands, Juttah and its pasturelands, and Beth Shemesh and its pasturelands; nine cities from these two tribes. 17 From the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon and its pasturelands, Geba and its pasturelands, 18 Anathoth and its pasturelands, Almon and its pasturelands; four cities. 19 All the cities of the descendants of Aaron the priests, thirteen cities and their pasturelands. 20 For the families of the descendants of Kohath, the remaining Levites of the descendants of Kohath, they received the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephraim. 21 They gave them Shechem, the city of refuge for the killer, and its pasturelands in the hill country of Ephraim, Gezer and its pasturelands, 22 Kibzaim and its pasturelands, and Beth-horon and its pasturelands; four cities. 23 From the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh and its pasturelands, Gibbethon and its pasturelands, 24 Aijalon and its pasturelands, and Gath Rimmon and its pasturelands; four cities. 25 From the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach and its pasturelands and Gath Rimmon with its pasturelands; two cities. 26 All the cities and their pasturelands for the remaining families of the descendants of Kohath were ten. 27 To the descendants of Gershon, one of the families of the Levites, from the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan, a city of refuge for the killer, and its pasturelands, and Eshtarah and its pasturelands; two cities. 28 From the tribe of Issachar, Kishion and its pasturelands, Daberath and its pasturelands, 29 Jarmuth and its pasturelands, En Gannim and its pasturelands; four cities. 30 From the tribe of Asher, Mishal and its pasturelands, Abdon and its pasturelands, 31 Helkath and its pasturelands, Rehob and its pasturelands; four cities. 32 From the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee, the city of refuge for the killer, and its pasturelands, Hammoth Dor and its pasturelands, and Kartan and its pasturelands; three cities. 33 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities and their pasturelands. 34 To the families of the descendants of Merarite, the remaining Levites, from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam and its pasturelands, Kartah and its pasturelands, 35 Dimnah and its pasturelands, and Nahalal and its pasturelands; four cities. 36 From the tribe of Reuben, Bezer and its pasturelands, Jahaz and its pasturelands, 37 Kedemoth and its pasturelands, and Mephaath and its pasturelands; four cities. 38 From the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead, the city of refuge for the killer, and its pasturelands, Mahanaim and its pasturelands, 39 Heshbon and its pasturelands, and Jazer and its pasturelands; four cities in all. 40 All these were the cities of the descendants of Merarite according to their families, the remaining families of the Levites; their allotment was twelve cities. 41 All the cities of the Levites among the property of the Israelites were forty-eight cities and their pasturelands. 42 Each of these cities had pasturelands surrounding them; so it was for all of these cities. 43 And Yahweh gave to Israel all the land that he swore to give to their ancestors, and they took possession of it and settled in it. 44 Yahweh gave them rest on every side, according to all that he had sworn to their ancestors, and nobody from all their enemies withstood them, for Yahweh had given all their enemies into their hand. 45 And nothing failed from all the good things that Yahweh promised to the house of Israel; everything came to pass. 1 Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 2 and he said to them, “You have observed all that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, and you have listened to my voice in all that I have commanded you; 3 you have not forsaken your kinsmen these many days, up to this day, and you have observed the obligation of the command of Yahweh your God. 4 So then, Yahweh your God has given rest to your kinsmen, just as he promised them; so then, turn and go to your tents to the land of your possession, which Moses Yahweh’s servant gave to you beyond the Jordan. 5 Only be very careful to observe the commandment and law that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.” 6 And Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents. 7 And to the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua had given a possession with their kinsmen beyond the Jordan to the west; and when Joshua sent them to their tents and blessed them, 8 he said to them, “Return to your tents with much wealth, and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, copper, iron, and with very much clothing; divide the war-booty of your enemies with your kinsmen.” 9 So the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home and departed with the Israelites at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead to the land of their possession, which they had acquired according to the command of Yahweh through the hand of Moses. 10 And they came to the region of the Jordan that is in the land of Canaan, and the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar on the Jordan, a large and imposing altar. 11 And the Israelites heard it said that the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had built an altar next to the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, on the side belonging to the Israelites. 12 When the Israelites heard of it, the whole congregation of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh to go up against them for battle. 13 And the Israelites sent to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, Phinehas the priest son of Eleazar, 14 and ten leaders with him, one leader for each family from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one was the head of his family among the clans of Israel. 15 They came to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying, 16 “Thus says all the congregation of Yahweh: ‘What is this treachery that you have committed against the God of Israel by turning away today from following Yahweh, by building for yourselves an altar to rebel today against Yahweh? 17 Is not the sin of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves today, and for which a plague came to the congregation of Yahweh, 18 that you must turn today from following Yahweh? If you rebel today against Yahweh, tomorrow he will be angry with all of the congregation of Israel; 19 if, however, the land of your property is unclean, cross over to the land of Yahweh’s property, where Yahweh’s tabernacle resides, and take possession among us. But you must not rebel against Yahweh or against us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of Yahweh our God. 20 Did not Achan son of Zerah commit treachery with devoted things, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? And he alone did not perish because of his iniquity.’ ” 21 And the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh spoke with the heads of the clans of Israel, 22 “Yahweh, God of gods! Yahweh, God of gods knows. And let Israel itself know, if it was in rebellion or treachery against Yahweh, do not spare us this day 23 for building for ourselves an altar to turn away from Yahweh, or if it was to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings, or fellowship offerings on it, may Yahweh himself take vengeance. 24 But in fact, we have done this because of anxiety, because of a reason, saying, ‘In the future your children may say to our children, ‘What is the relationship between you and Yahweh the God of Israel? 25 Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, the descendants of Reuben and Gad; you have no portion in Yahweh.’ So your children may put an end to our children worshiping Yahweh. 26 So we said, ‘Let us build immediately for ourselves an altar, not for burnt offerings or for sacrifices; 27 instead, it is a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us for performing the serving of Yahweh in his presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings; so that your children may not say in the future to our children, “You have no portion in Yahweh.” ’ 28 And we thought, if they say to us and to our children in the future, we can say, ‘Look at this replica of the altar of Yahweh, which our ancestors made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices; rather, it is a witness between us and you.’ 29 Far be it from us to rebel against Yahweh, to turn today from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices, instead of the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle.” 30 Phinehas the priest, the leaders of the congregation, and the heads of the clans of Israel who were with him heard the words that the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh spoke, and they were satisfied. 31 Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar, said to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, “Today we know that Yahweh is among us, because you have not committed this treachery against Yahweh. Therefore you have rescued the Israelites from the hand of Yahweh.” 32 And Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar, and the leaders returned from the descendants of Reuben and Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan to the Israelites, and they gave them their report. 33 The report satisfied the Israelites; they blessed God, and they did not speak of going up for battle against them to destroy the land in which the descendants of Reuben and Gad were living. 34 The descendants of Reuben and Gad called the altar Witness, “Because,” they said, “it is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.” ","Joshua 21, 22",http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/joshua-21-22-280149/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-06-07_joshua-21-22_20120510002858.mp3
Joshua,"1 And it happened, after a long time, after Yahweh had given rest to Israel from all their surrounding enemies, and after Joshua was old and well-advanced in years, 2 Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders, heads, judges, and officials, and he said to them, “I am old and well-advanced in years, 3 and you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations for your sake, for Yahweh your God is fighting for you. 4 Look! I have allotted to you these remaining nations as an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, to the Great Sea in the west. 5 And Yahweh your God will push them back before you and drive them out of your sight, and you will possess their land, just as Yahweh your God promised to you. 6 Be very strong to observe carefully all that is written in the scroll of the law of Moses so as not to turn aside from it, to the right or left, 7 so as not to go among these remaining nations with you; do not profess the name of their gods, and do not swear by them, serve them, or bow down to them. 8 But hold fast to Yahweh your God, just as you have done up to this day. 9 Yahweh has driven out before you great and strong nations; and as for you, nobody has withstood you to this day. 10 One of your men put to flight a thousand, for Yahweh your God is fighting for you, just as he promised you. 11 Take utmost care for the sake of your life to love Yahweh your God, 12 for if indeed you turn back and join these remaining nations among you, and you intermarry with them, marrying their women and they yours, 13 know for certain that Yahweh your God will not continue to drive out these nations from before you; they will be for you a snare and a trap, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that Yahweh your God has given to you. 14 Look! I am about to die, and you know in all your hearts and souls that not one thing failed from all the good things that Yahweh your God promised concerning you; everything has been fulfilled; not one thing failed. 15 But just as all the good things came to you that Yahweh your God promised, so will Yahweh bring to you all the bad things until he has destroyed you from this good land that Yahweh your God has given to you. 16 If you transgress the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he commanded to you, and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, Yahweh’s anger will be kindled against you, and you will perish quickly from the good land that he has given to you.” 1 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem; he summoned the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officials, and they presented themselves before God. 2 And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: ‘Long ago your ancestors—Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor—lived beyond the river, and they served other gods. 3 I took your ancestor Abraham from beyond the river and led him through all the land of Canaan, and I increased his offspring; I gave him Isaac, 4 and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. 5 And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out. 6 When I brought out your ancestors from Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your ancestors with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. 7 They cried out to Yahweh, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea over them and covered them; your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you lived in the wilderness for many days. 8 And I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan; they fought you, and I gave them into your hand; you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you. 9 Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, set out and fought against Israel, and he sent and summoned Balaam son of Beor to curse you, 10 but I was not willing to listen to Balaam, and he richly blessed you. So I rescued you from his hand, 11 and you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the citizens of Jericho, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, fought against you, and I gave them into your hand. 12 I sent before you the hornet and they drove out before you two kings of the Amorites; but not by your sword or bow. 13 I gave to you a land that you have not labored on, and cities that you have not built, and you live in them; you eat from vineyards and olive groves that you have not planted.’ 14 “So now, revere Yahweh and serve him in sincerity and faithfulness; remove the gods that your ancestors served beyond the river and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh. 15 But if it is bad in your eyes to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves today whom you want to serve, whether it is the gods that your ancestors served beyond the river, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve Yahweh.” 16 And the people answered and said, “Far be it from us that we would forsake Yahweh to serve other gods, 17 for Yahweh our God brought us and our ancestors from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, and did these great signs before our eyes. He protected us along the entire way that we went, and among all the peoples through whose midst we passed. 18 And Yahweh drove out all the people before us, the Amorites who live in the land. We will serve Yahweh, for he is our God.” 19 But Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve Yahweh, for he is a holy and jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins. 20 If you forsake Yahweh and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster to you; he will destroy you after he has done good to you.” 21 And the people said to Joshua, “No, we will serve Yahweh.” 22 And Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves to serve Yahweh.” And they said, “We are witnesses.” 23 He said, “Remove the foreign gods that are in your midst, and incline your hearts to Yahweh the God of Israel.” 24 And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his voice.” 25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and he established for them a statute and a judgment at Shechem. 26 Then Joshua wrote these words in a scroll of the law of God, and he took a large stone and set it up there under a large tree, which is at the shrine of Yahweh. 27 And Joshua said to all the people, “Look, this stone will be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of Yahweh that he spoke with us. It will be as a witness against you, so that you do not deny your God.” 28 Then Joshua sent the people away to their inheritance. 29 After these things Joshua son of Nun servant of Yahweh died; he was one hundred and ten years old. 30 They buried him in the territory of his inheritance, at Timnath-Serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 31 Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who lived long after Joshua, and who had known all the work that Yahweh did for Israel. 32 The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought out from Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in a piece of land that Jacob had bought from the children of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred pieces of money; it became an inheritance for the descendants of Joseph. 33 And Eleazar son of Aaron died; and they buried him in Gibeah in the hill country of Ephraim, which had been given to his son Phinehas.

Deuteronomy,"1 These are the words that Moses spoke to all of Israel on the other side of the Jordan in the desert, in the desert plateau opposite Suph, between Paran and between Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab. 2 It is a journey of eleven days from Herob by the way of Mount Seir up to Kadesh Barnea. 3 And it was in the fortieth year, on the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the Israelites according to all that Yahweh had instructed him to speak to them. 4 This happened after defeating Sihon king of the Amorites, who was reigning in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who was reigning in Ashtaroth in Edrei. 5 On the other side of the Jordan in the land of Moab Moses began to explain this law, saying: 6 “Yahweh our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain. 7 Turn now and move on, and go into the hill of the Amorites and to all of the neighboring regions in the Jordan Valley in the hill country and in the Negev and in the coastal area along the sea, into the land of the Canaanites and into the Lebanon, as far as the great river Euphrates. 8 Look, I have set the land before you; go and take possession of the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give it to them and to their offspring after them.’ 9 “And I spoke to them at that time, saying, ‘I am not able to bear you alone. 10 Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and look; you are today as the stars of the heaven in number. 11 Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, may he add to you as you are now a thousand times, and may he bless you just as he promised you. 12 How can I bear you by myself, your burden and your load and your strife? 13 Choose for yourselves wise and discerning and knowledgeable men for each of your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’ 14 “And you answered me, and you said, ‘The thing you have said to do is good.’ 15 And so I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and then I appointed them as leaders over you as commanders of groups of thousands and commanders of groups of hundreds and commanders of groups of fifties and commanders of groups of tens as officials for your tribes. 16 And at that time I instructed your judges, saying, ‘hear out your fellow men, and then judge fairly between a man and between his brother and between his opponent who is a resident alien. 17 You must not be partial in your judgment; hear out the small person as also the great person; do not be intimidated by any person, because the judgment is God’s; and the case that is too difficult for you, bring it to me, and I will hear it out.’ 18 And so I instructed you at that time concerning all of the things that you should do. 19 “Then we set out from Horeb, and we went through the whole of that great and terrible desert that you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites as Yahweh our God had commanded us, and so we came up to Kadesh Barnea. 20 I said to you, ‘You have reached the hill country of the Amorites that Yahweh our God is giving to us. 21 See, Yahweh your God has set before you the land; go up and possess it as Yahweh the God of your ancestors said to you; do not fear and do not be dismayed.’ 22 “Then all of you approached me, and you said, ‘Let us send men before us, and let them explore the land for us, and let them bring back a report to us concerning the way that we should take and concerning the cities that we shall come to.’ 23 The plan was good in my opinion, and so I took from among you twelve men, one from each tribe. 24 And they set out and went up into the hill country, and they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and they spied out the land. 25 They took in their hands some of the fruit of the land, and they brought it down to us, and they brought to us back a report, and they said, ‘The land that Yahweh our God is giving to us is good.’ 26 But you were not willing to go up, and you rebelled against the command of Yahweh your God. 27 And you grumbled in your tents, and you said, ‘Because of the hatred of Yahweh toward us he has brought us out from the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us. 28 Where can we go up? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying, “The people are greater and taller than we are, and there are great fortified cities reaching up to heaven, and we saw the sons of the Anakites living there.” ’ 29 “And so I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified, and do not fear them. 30 Yahweh your God, who is going before you, will himself fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, 31 and just as he did in the wilderness when you saw that Yahweh your God carried you, just as someone carries his son, all along the way that you traveled until you reached this place.’ 32 But through all of this you did not trust in Yahweh your God, 33 who goes before you on your way, seeking a place for your encampment, in fire at night and in a cloud by day, to show you the way that you should go. 34 “Then Yahweh heard the sound of your words, and he was angry, and he swore, saying, 35 ‘No one of these men of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors, ",Deuteronomy 1:1-35,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/deuteronomy-11-35-274015/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-04-25_deuteronomy-11-35_20120423095858.mp3
Deuteronomy,"36 except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh; he himself shall see it, and to him I will give the land upon which he has trodden and to his sons because he followed Yahweh unreservedly.’ 37 Even with me Yahweh was angry because of you, saying, ‘Not even you shall enter there. 38 Joshua, the son of Nun, your assistant, will go there; encourage him because he will cause Israel to inherit it. 39 And your little children, who you thought shall become plunder, and your sons, who do not today know good or bad, shall themselves go there, and I will give it to them, and they shall take possession of it. 40 But you turn and set out in the direction of the wilderness by way of the Red Sea.’ 41 “You replied and said to me, ‘We have sinned against Yahweh, and now we will go up and fight according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us’; and so each man fastened on his battle gear, and you regarded it as easy to go up into the hill country. 42 So Yahweh said to me, ‘Say to them, “You shall not go up, and you shall not fight because I am not in your midst; you will be defeated before your enemies.” ’ 43 So I spoke to you, but you did not listen; you rebelled against the command of Yahweh; you behaved presumptuously, and you went up into the hill country. 44 The Amorites living in the hill country went out to oppose you and chased you as a swarm of wild honey bees do; and so they beat you down in Seir as far as Hormah. 45 So you returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh did not listen to your voice and did not pay any attention to you. 46 You stayed in Kadesh many days; such were the days that you stayed there. 1 “Then we turned and set out toward the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea, as Yahweh told me, and we went around Mount Seir for many days. 2 Yahweh spoke to me, saying, 3 ‘Long enough you have been skirting this mountain; turn yourselves north, 4 and instruct the people, saying, “You are about to cross through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who are living in Seir; they will be afraid of you, and so be very careful. 5 Do not get involved in battle with them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even a foot’s breadth of it; since I have given Mount Seir as a possession for Esau. 6 You shall buy food from them so that you may eat; and also you shall purchase water from them with money so that you may drink. 7 The fact of the matter is, Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work you have done; he knows your travels with respect to this great wilderness; forty years Yahweh your God has been with you; you have not lacked a thing.” ’ 8 And so we passed by our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, past the road of the Arabah, from Elath and Ezion Geber, and we turned and traveled along the route of the desert of Moab. 9 And Yahweh said to me, ‘You shall not attack Moab, and you shall not engage in war with them, for I will not give you any of his land as a possession; I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.’ 10 (The Emim previously lived in it, a people large, numerous, and tall, like the Anakites. 11 They were reckoned also as Rephaim as the Anakites were; but the Moabites called them Emim. 12 The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from among themselves, as Israel did with respect to the land of their possession that Yahweh gave to them.) 13 So now arise and cross over the wadi of Zered yourselves; and so we crossed the wadi of Zered. 14 Now the length of time that we had traveled from Kadesh Barnea until the time when we crossed the wadi of Zered was thirty-eight years, until the perishing of all of that generation; that is, the men of war from the midst of the camp as Yahweh had sworn to them. 15 The hand of Yahweh was against them to root them out from the midst of the camp until they perished completely. 16 “And then when all the men of war had died from among the people, 17 Yahweh spoke to me, saying, 18 ‘You are about to cross over the boundary of Moab today at Ar. 19 When you approach the border of the Ammonites, you shall not harass them, and you shall not get involved in battle with them, for I have not given the land of the Ammonites to you as a possession; because I have given it to the descendants of Lot as a possession. 20 (It is also considered the land of Rephaim; Rephaim lived in it previously, and the Ammonites called them Zamzummim, 21 a people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakites; Yahweh destroyed them from before them, and they dispossessed them and settled in place of them, 22 just as he did for the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them and dispossessed them, and then they settled in their place up to this day. 23 And also the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and the Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, destroyed them and then settled in their place. 24 Arise, set out and cross over the wadi of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, the king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession of it, and engage with him in battle. 25 This day I will begin to place the dread of you and the fear of you before the peoples under all the heavens. They will hear the report about you, and so they will shake and tremble because of you.’ 26 “So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon; I sent terms of peace, saying, 27 ‘Let me cross through your land and only along the road I will go; I will not turn aside to the right or to the left. 28 Food for money you shall sell me, so that I may eat, and water for money you will give to me, so that I may drink; just let me cross on foot. 29 Just as the descendants of Esau did for me, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, until I cross the Jordan into the land that Yahweh our God is giving to us.’ 30 But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing to let us cross through his territory because Yahweh your God hardened his spirit and made him obstinate in order to give him into your hand, just as he has now done. 31 Yahweh said to me, ‘Look! I have begun to give over to you Sihon and his land; begin to take possession of his land.’ 32 Then Sihon and all his people came out to meet us for battle at Jahaz. 33 And so Yahweh our God gave him over to us, and we struck him down, and his sons and all of his people. 34 So we captured all of his cities at that time, and we destroyed each town of males and the women and the children; we did not leave behind a survivor. 35 We took only the livestock as spoil for ourselves, and also the booty of the cities that we had captured. 36 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon and the city that was in the wadi on up to Gilead, there was not a city that was inaccessible to us; Yahweh our God gave everything to us. 37 Only the land of the Ammonites you did not approach, all along the whole upper region of the Jabbok River and the towns of the hill country, according to all that Yahweh our God had instructed. 1 “Then we turned, and we went up the road to Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us, he and all of his army for the battle at Edrei. 2 And Yahweh said to me, ‘You should not fear him, for I have given him and all of his army and his land into your hand. And so you will do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who was reigning in Heshbon.’ 3 And so Yahweh our God also gave Og the king of Bashan, and all of his army into our hand, and we struck him down until not a survivor remained to him. 4 And we captured all of his towns at that time; there was not a city that we did not take from them. 5 All of these were fortified towns with high walls, gates, and bars, apart from very many of the villages of the open country. 6 And so we destroyed them just as we had done to Sihon the king of Heshbon; we destroyed utterly each town of males, the women, and the little children. 7 But all of the livestock and the booty of the towns we kept as spoil for ourselves. 8 “And so we took at that time the land from the control of the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, from the wadi of Arnon up to Mount Hermon. 9 (The Sidonians called Hermon ‘Sirion,’ and the Amorites called it ‘Senir.’) 10 All of the towns of the plateau and the whole of Gilead and all of Bashan up to Salecah and Edrei, the towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 11 (For only Og, king of Bashan, was left from the remnant of the Rephaim. Indeed, his bedstead—it was a bedstead of iron. It is in Rabbah of the Ammonites. Nine cubits is its length, and four cubits is its width according to the cubit of a man.) 12 And so we took possession of this land at that time, from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon, and also half of the hill country of Gilead and its towns I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites. 13 And the remainder of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the whole region of Argo. All of that area of Bashan was called the land of the Rephaim. 14 Jair the descendant of Manasseh acquired the whole region of Argob, up to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and he called it, that is Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, as it still is today. 15 And also I gave Gilead to Makir. 16 And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave, from Gilead up to the wadi of Arnon, the middle of the wadi as a boundary and up to the Jabbok River, the boundary of the Ammonites. 17 And the Jordan Valley with the Jordan River as its boundary, from Kinnereth up to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, with the slopes of Pisgah toward the east. 18 “And I charged you all at that time when I said, “Yahweh has given you—to all of you—this land to possess. All the warriors shall cross over, ready to fight, before your brothers, the Israelites. 19 Only your wives and your little children and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) must stay in your towns that I have given you, 20 until Yahweh shall give rest to your brothers as he did to you, and also they take possession of the land that Yahweh your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan; then they may return, each one to his possession that I have given to them. 21 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes see all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings; so Yahweh will do to all of the kingdoms where you are about to cross over to. 22 You shall not fear them, for Yahweh your God is the one fighting for you. 23 “And I pleaded with Yahweh at that time, saying, 24 ‘Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand, for what god is there in the heaven or on the earth who can do according to your works and according to your mighty deeds? 25 Let me cross over, please, and let me see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, this good hill country and Lebanon.’ 26 But Yahweh was very angry with me because of you, and he would not listen to me, and Yahweh said, ‘Enough of that from you! You shall not speak to me any longer about this matter! 27 Go up to the top of Pisgah and look around you toward the west, toward the north, and toward the east, and view the land with your eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan. 28 Now instruct Joshua and support him and encourage him because he himself will cross over before this people and enable them to inherit the land that you will see.’ 29 So we remained in the valley opposite Beth Peor. 1 “Now, Israel, listen to the rules and to the regulations that I am teaching you to do, in order that you may live and you may go in and you may take possession of the land that Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, is giving to you. 2 You must not add to the word that I am commanding you, and you shall not take away from it in order to keep the commands of Yahweh your God that I am commanding you to observe.

Deuteronomy,"1 “Now, Israel, listen to the rules and to the regulations that I am teaching you to do, in order that you may live and you may go in and you may take possession of the land that Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, is giving to you. 2 You must not add to the word that I am commanding you, and you shall not take away from it in order to keep the commands of Yahweh your God that I am commanding you to observe. 3 Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did with the case of Baal Peor, for each man that followed after Baal Peor Yahweh your God destroyed from your midst. 4 But you, the ones holding fast to Yahweh your God, are all alive today. 5 See, I now teach you rules and regulations just as Yahweh my God has commanded me, to observe them just so in the midst of the land where you are going, to take possession of it. 6 And you must observe them diligently, for that is your wisdom and your insight before the eyes of the people, who will hear all of these rules, and they will say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and discerning people.’ 7 For what great nation has for it a god near to it as Yahweh our God, whenever we call upon him? 8 And what other great nation has for it just rules and regulations just like this whole law that I am setting before you today? 9 “However, take care for yourself and watch your inner self closely, so that you do not forget the things that your eyes have seen, so that they do not slip from your mind all the days of your life; and you shall make them known to your children and to your grandchildren. 10 Remember the day that you stood before Yahweh your God at Horeb when Yahweh said to me, ‘Summon for me the people so that I can tell them my words, that they may learn to fear me all of the days they are alive on the earth and so that they may teach their children.’ 11 And so you came near, and you stood under the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire up to the heart of the heaven, dark with a very thick cloud. 12 And Yahweh spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard a sound of words, but you did not see a form—only a voice. 13 And he declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he charged you to observe, and he wrote them on the two tablets of stone. 14 And Yahweh charged me at that time to teach you rules and regulations for your observation of them in the land that you are about to cross into to take possession of it. 15 “So you must be very careful for yourselves, because you did not see any form on the day Yahweh spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire, 16 so that you do not ruin yourselves and make for yourselves a divine image in a form of any image, a replica of male or female, 17 a replica of any animal that is upon the earth, a replica of any winged bird that flies in the air, 18 a replica of any creeping thing on the ground, a replica of any fish that is in the water below the earth. 19 And do this so that you do not lift your eyes toward heaven and observe the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of the heaven, and be led astray and bow down to them and serve them, things that Yahweh your God has allotted to all of the peoples under all of the heaven. 20 But Yahweh has taken you and brought you out from the furnace of iron, from Egypt, to be a people of inheritance to him, as it is this day. 21 “And Yahweh was angry with me because of you, and he swore that I would not cross the Jordan and that I would not go to the good land that Yahweh your God is giving you as an inheritance. 22 For I am going to die in this land; I am not going to cross the Jordan, but you are going to cross, and you are going to take possession of this good land. 23 Watch out for yourselves so that you do not forget the covenant of Yahweh your God that he had made with you and make for yourselves a divine image of the form of anything that Yahweh your God has forbidden, 24 for Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God. 25 “When you have had children and grandchildren and you have grown old in the land and you act corruptly and you make a divine image of the form of anything and you do evil in the eyes of Yahweh your God, thus provoking him to anger, 26 I call to witness against you today the heaven and the earth, that you will perish soon and completely from the land that you are crossing the Jordan into it to take possession of it; you will not live long on it, but you will be completely destroyed. 27 And Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations to where Yahweh will lead you. 28 And you will there serve gods made by human hands, of wood and stone, gods that cannot see and cannot hear and cannot eat and cannot smell. 29 But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God and will find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul. 30 In your distress when all these things have found you in the latter days, then you will return to Yahweh your God, and you will listen to his voice. 31 For Yahweh your God is a compassionate God; he will not abandon you, and he will not destroy you, and he will not forget the covenant of your ancestors that he swore to them. 32 “Yes, ask, please, about former days that preceded you from the day that God created humankind on the earth; ask even from one end of the heaven up to the other end of heaven whether anything ever happened like this great thing or whether anything like it was ever heard. 33 Has a people ever heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, just as you heard it, and lived? 34 Or has a god ever attempted to go to take for himself a nation from the midst of a nation, using trials and signs and wonders and war, with an outstretched arm and with great and awesome deeds, like all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? 35 You yourselves were shown this wonder in order for you to acknowledge that Yahweh is the God; there is no other God besides him. 36 From heaven he made you hear his voice to teach you, and on the earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from the midst of the fire. 37 And because he loved your ancestors he chose their descendants after them. And he brought you forth from Egypt with his own presence, by his great strength, 38 to drive out nations greater and more numerous than you from before you, to bring you and to give to you their land as an inheritance, as it is this day. 39 So you shall acknowledge today, and you must call to mind that Yahweh is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no other God. 40 And you shall keep his rules and his commandments that I am commanding you today, so that it may go well for you and for your children after you, and so that you may remain a long time on the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you during all of those days.” 41 Then Moses set apart three cities on the other side of the Jordan, toward the east, 42 in order for a manslayer to flee there who has killed his neighbor without intent and was not hating him previously, and so he could flee to one of these cities and be safe. 43 He set apart Bezer in the wilderness in the land of the plateau of the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead of the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan of the Manassites. 44 Now this is the law that Moses set before the Israelites; 45 these are the legal provisions and the rules and the regulations that Moses spoke to the Israelites when they left Egypt, 46 beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth Peor in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who was reigning in Heshbon and whom Moses and the Israelites defeated when they came out of Egypt. 47 And so they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, eastward, 48 from Aroer, which is on the bank of the wadi of Arnon and as far as Mount Sirion; that is, Hermon, 49 and all of the Arabah beyond the Jordan, eastward, and as far as the Sea of the Arabah under the slopes of Pisgah.

Deuteronomy,"1 And then Moses summoned all of Israel and said to them, “Hear, Israel, the rules and the regulations that I am speaking in your ears today, and you shall learn them, and you must observe them diligently. 2 Yahweh our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. 3 It was not with our ancestors that Yahweh made this covenant, but with these of us who are here alive today. 4 Face to face Yahweh spoke with you at the mountain from the midst of the fire. 5 I was standing between Yahweh and you at that time to report to you the word of Yahweh, for you were afraid because of the presence of the fire, and so you did not go up the mountain. He said, 6 ‘I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery. 7 There shall not be for you other gods besides me. 8 ‘You shall not make for yourself a divine image of any type of form that is in the heaven above or that is on the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth. 9 ‘You shall not bow down to them, and you shall not serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, punishing the guilt of fathers upon their children and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of those hating me, 10 but showing loyal love to thousands of those who love me and of those who keep my commandments. 11 ‘You shall not take up the name of Yahweh your God for a worthless purpose, for Yahweh will not leave unpunished anyone who uses his name for a worthless purpose. 12 ‘Observe the Sabbath day to make it holy, just as Yahweh your God has commanded you. 13 Six days you shall work, and you shall do all of your work, 14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath unto Yahweh your God; you shall not do any work, or your son, or your daughter, or your slave, or your slave woman, or your ox, or your donkey, or any of your domestic animals, or your resident alien who is in your towns, so that your slave and your slave woman may rest as you rest. 15 And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God brought you out with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm; therefore, Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath. 16 ‘Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you, so that it will be good for you in the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you. 17 ‘You shall not murder. 18 ‘And you shall not commit adultery. 19 ‘And you shall not steal. 20 ‘And you shall not falsely bear evidence against your neighbor. 21 ‘And you shall not covet the wife of your neighbor, and you shall not crave the house of your neighbor, his field or his slave or his slave woman or his ox and his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.’ 22 “These words Yahweh spoke to your whole assembly at the mountain from the midst of the fire and the very thick cloud with a loud voice, and he did not add anything, and then he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me. 23 And then when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, and as the mountain was burning with fire, and and all the heads of your tribes and your elders approached me, 24 you said, ‘Look, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire; this day we have seen that God can speak with a human being, yet he remains alive. 25 And so then why shall we die, for this great fire will consume us if we continue to hear the voice of Yahweh our God any longer, and so we shall die? 26 For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire as we have heard it and remained alive? 27 You go near and hear everything that Yahweh our God will say; and then you tell us all that Yahweh our God tells you, and we will listen, and we will do it.’ 28 “And Yahweh heard the sound of your words when you spoke to me, and Yahweh said to me, ‘I have heard the sound of the words of this people that they have spoken to you; they are right with respect to all that they have spoken. 29 If only they had such a mind’; that is, to fear me and to keep all my commandments at all times, so that it will go well for them and for their children forever. 30 Go! Say to them, “Return to your tents.” 31 But you stand here with me, and let me tell you all of the commandments and the rules and the regulations that you shall teach them, so that they may do them in the land that I am giving to them to take possession of it.’ 32 “So you must be careful to do just as Yahweh your God commanded you; you shall not turn to the right or to the left. 33 In exactly the path that Yahweh your God has commanded, you must go, so that you may live and it will go well for you and you may live long in the land that you will take possession of.” ",Deuteronomy 5,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/deuteronomy-5-274018/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-04-30_deuteronomy-5_20120423100058.mp3
Deuteronomy,"1 “Now this is the commandment, the rules and the regulations, that Yahweh your God charged to teach to you for you to observe in the land that you are about to cross over into to take possession of it, 2 so that you may revere Yahweh your God by keeping all his statutes and his commandments that I am commanding you, you and your children and grandchildren, all the days of your life and so you may live long lives. 3 And you shall hear, Israel, and be careful to observe these instructions, so that it may go well for you and that you may multiply greatly, just as Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, promised you, in a land with milk and honey. 4 “Hear, Israel, Yahweh our God, Yahweh is unique. 5 And you shall love Yahweh your God with all of your heart and with all of your soul and with all of your might. 6 And these words that I am commanding you today shall be on your heart. 7 And you shall recite them to your children, and you shall talk about them at the time of your living in your house and at the time of your going on the road and at the time of your lying down and at the time of your rising up. 8 And you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as an emblem between your eyes. 9 And you shall write them on the doorframe of your house and on your gates. 10 “And then it will happen that when Yahweh your God will bring you to the land that he swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to you large and fine cities that you did not build, 11 and houses full of all sorts of good things that you did not fill, and hewn cisterns that you did not hew, vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant, and you have eaten your fill, 12 then take care for yourself, so that you do not forget Yahweh, who brought you out from the land of Egypt from the house of slavery. 13 “You shall fear Yahweh your God, and you shall serve him, and by his name you shall swear. 14 You shall not go after other gods from the gods of the peoples who are all around you, 15 for Yahweh your God is a jealous god in your midst, so that the anger of Yahweh your God would be kindled, and he would destroy you from the face of the earth. 16 You shall not put Yahweh your God to the test, as you tested him at Massah. 17 You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God and his legal provisions and his rules that he has commanded you. 18 And you shall do what is right and good in the eyes of Yahweh, so that it shall go well for you and so that you may go and you may take possession of the good land that Yahweh swore for your ancestors, 19 by driving out all of your enemies before you, just as Yahweh has promised. 20 “When your child asks you in the future, saying, ‘What is the meaning of the legal provisions and the rules and the regulations that Yahweh our God commanded for you?’ 21 Then you shall say to your child, ‘We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, and Yahweh brought us out from Egypt with a strong hand. 22 And Yahweh gave great and awesome signs and wonders in Egypt against Pharaoh and against his entire household in our presence. 23 But he brought us out from there in order to bring us here to give us the land that he swore to our ancestors. 24 And so Yahweh commanded us to observe all of these rules and to revere Yahweh our God for our benefit all the days that we live, as it is today. 25 And it shall be righteousness for us if we diligently observe and do all of this commandment before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.’ 1 “When Yahweh your God brings you into the land that you are about to enter into it to take possession of it, and he drives out many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations mightier and more numerous than you, 2 and Yahweh your God will give them over to you and you defeat them, you must utterly destroy them; you shall not make a covenant with them, and you shall not show mercy to them. 3 And you shall not intermarry with them; you shall not give your daughter to their son; and you shall not take his daughter for your son. 4 For their sons and daughters will cause your son to turn away from following me, and so they will serve other gods, and the anger of Yahweh would be kindled against you, and he would quickly destroy you. 5 But this is what you must do to them: you shall break down their altars, and their stone pillars you shall smash, and their Asherah poles you shall hew down, and you shall burn their idols with fire. 6 For you are a holy people for Yahweh your God; Yahweh your God has chosen you to be for him a people, a treasured possession from among all the peoples that are on the face of the earth. 7 “Yahweh loved you and chose you not because of your great number exceeding all other peoples, for you are fewer than all of the peoples, 8 but because of the love of Yahweh for you and because of his keeping of the sworn oath that he swore to your ancestors, Yahweh brought you out with a strong hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. 9 So know that Yahweh your God, he is God, the trustworthy God, maintaining his covenant and his loyal love with those who love him and with those who keep his commandments to a thousand generations, 10 but repaying those who hate him in their own person to destroy them; he is not slow with those who hate him in their own person; he repays them. 11 And so you shall keep the commandment and the rules and the regulations that I am commanding you today to observe them. 12 “And then because you listen to these regulations and you diligently keep and you do them, then Yahweh your God will maintain his covenant and his loyal love that he swore to your ancestors. 13 And he will love you, and he will bless you, and he will multiply you, and he will bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your soil, your grain, your wine, and your olive oil, and newborn calves of your cattle, and the newborn lambs of your flocks in the land that he swore to your ancestors to give you. 14 You shall be blessed more than all of the peoples; among you there shall not be sterility and bareness, even among domestic animals. 15 And Yahweh will turn away from you all the illness and all the harmful diseases of Egypt that you experienced; he will not lay them on you, but he will lay them on all of those who hate you. 16 And you shall devour all of the peoples that Yahweh your God is giving to you; you shall not pity them, and you shall not serve their gods, which will be a snare for you. 17 “If you think in your heart, ‘These nations are more numerous than I, so how can I dispossess them?’ 18 then remember you must not be afraid of them; you must well remember what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh and to all of Egypt: 19 the great trials that your eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the workings of the strong hand and the outstretched arm by which Yahweh your God brought you out; so Yahweh your God will do to all of the peoples because of whom you are in fear before them. 20 And, moreover, Yahweh your God will send the hornets among them until both the survivors and the fugitives are destroyed before you. 21 You must not be in dread from the presence of them, because Yahweh your God, who is in your midst, is a great and awesome God. 22 And Yahweh your God will clear away these nations from before you little by little; you will not be able to finish them off quickly, lest the wild animals multiply against you. 23 But Yahweh your God will give them to you, and he will throw them into great panic until they are destroyed. 24 And he will give their kings into your hand, and you shall blot out their names from under the heaven; anyone will not be able to stand against you until you destroy them. 25 You shall burn the images of their gods with fire; you shall not covet the silver or gold that is on them, and so you take it for yourself, so that you are not ensnared by it, for it is a detestable thing to Yahweh your God. 26 And you must not bring a detestable thing into your house, or you will become a thing devoted to destruction like it; you must utterly detest it, and you must utterly abhor it, for it is an object devoted to destruction.

Deuteronomy,"1 “All of the commandments that I am commanding you today you must diligently observe, so that you may live and multiply, and you may go and take possession of the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors. 2 And you shall remember all of the way that Yahweh your God led you during these forty years in the desert in order to humble you and to test you to know what is in your heart, whether you would diligently keep his commandments or not. 3 And he humbled you and let you go hungry, and then he fed you with that which you did not know nor did your ancestors know, in order to make you know that not by bread alone but by all that goes out of the mouth of Yahweh humankind shall live. 4 Your clothing did not wear out on you, and your feet did not swell during these forty years. 5 And you should know with your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so Yahweh your God is disciplining you. 6 So you must keep the commandments of Yahweh your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him. 7 For Yahweh your God is bringing you to a good land with streams of water, springs and underground water, welling up in the valleys and in the hills, 8 to a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranate trees, a land of olive trees, olive oil and honey; 9 to a land where you may eat food in it without scarcity; you will not find anything lacking in it, a land where its stones are iron and from its mountains you can mine copper. 10 And you will eat, and you will be satisfied, and you will bless Yahweh your God because of the good land that he has given to you. 11 “Take care for yourself so that you not forget Yahweh your God by not keeping his commandments and his regulations and his statutes that I am commanding you today, 12 lest when you have eaten and you are satisfied and you have built good houses and you live in them, 13 and your herds and your flocks have multiplied, and you have accumulated silver and gold, and all that you have has multiplied, 14 then your heart becomes proud and you forget Yahweh your God, the one who brought you out from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, 15 the one leading you in the great and terrible desert infested with dangerous snakes and scorpions and parched ground, where there is no water, and the one bringing out water for you from flint rock, 16 the one feeding you manna in the desert, food that your ancestors did not know, in order to humble you and in order to test you so that he could do good to you in the future. 17 And you may think in your heart, ‘My strength and the might of my hand acquired this wealth for me.’ 18 But you must remember Yahweh your God, for he is the one giving you strength to acquire wealth in order to confirm his covenant that he swore to your ancestors as it is today. 19 And it will happen that if you indeed forget Yahweh your God and you go after other gods and you serve them and you bow down before them, I warn you today that you will surely perish. 20 As with the nations that Yahweh is destroying before you, so you shall perish because you would not obey the voice of Yahweh your God. 1 “Hear, Israel, you are about to cross the Jordan today to go to dispossess nations larger and more numerous than you, great cities fortified with high walls, 2 a great and tall people, the sons of the Anakites, whom you know and of whom you have heard it said, ‘Who could stand before the sons of Anak?’ 3 You should know today that Yahweh your God is the one crossing ahead of you as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will subdue them before you; so you will dispossess them, and you will destroy them quickly, just as Yahweh promised you. 4 “You shall not say to yourself when Yahweh your God is driving them out before you, saying, ‘Because of my righteousness Yahweh brought me to take possession of this land’; but because of the wickedness of these nations Yahweh is driving them out before you. 5 It is not because of your righteousness and because of the uprightness of your heart that you are coming to take possession of their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God is driving them before you, and in order to confirm the promise that Yahweh swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 6 “So you should understand that it is not because of your righteousness that Yahweh your God is giving you this good land to take possession of it, because you are a stubborn people.

Deuteronomy,"7 Remember, do not forget, that you provoked Yahweh your God in the desert, and from the day that you went out from the land of Egypt until you came to this place you were rebelling against Yahweh. 8 “And remember at Horeb you provoked Yahweh, and Yahweh became angry enough to destroy you. 9 When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that Yahweh made with you, and remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights, I did not eat food and I did not drink water. 10 And Yahweh gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them was writing according to all the words that Yahweh spoke with you at the mountain, from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. 11 And then at the end of forty days and forty nights, Yahweh gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant. 12 And Yahweh said to me, ‘Come now, go down quickly from this mountain because your people behave corruptly whom you brought out from Egypt, for they turned quickly from the way that I commanded them to follow; they have made for themselves a cast image.’ 13 And Yahweh spoke to me, saying, ‘I have seen this people, and look! They are a stubborn people. 14 Leave me alone, and let me destroy them, and let me blot out their name from under heaven, and let me make you into a nation mightier and more numerous than they!’ 15 “And I turned, and I went down the mountain, as the mountain was burning with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. 16 And I looked, and indeed you had sinned against Yahweh your God; you had made for yourselves an image of a calf of cast metal; you had turned quickly from the way that Yahweh had commanded for you. 17 And I took hold of the two tablets, and I threw them out of my two hands and smashed them before your eyes. 18 And then I lay prostrate before Yahweh, as earlier, forty days and forty nights; I did not eat food and I did not drink water because of all your sins that you committed, by doing evil in the eyes of Yahweh and so provoking him. 19 For I was in dread from being in the presence of the anger and the wrath with which Yahweh was angry with you so as to destroy you, but Yahweh listened to me also at that time. 20 And with Aaron Yahweh was angry enough to destroy him, and I prayed also for Aaron at that time. 21 And your sinful thing that you had made, the molten calf, I took and I burned it with fire, and I crushed it, grinding it thoroughly until it was crushed to dust, and I threw its dust into the stream that flowed down the mountain. 22 “And also at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Yahweh to anger. 23 And when Yahweh sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, saying, ‘Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,’ you rebelled against the command of Yahweh your God, and you did not believe him, and you did not listen to his voice. 24 You have been rebellious toward Yahweh from the day I have known you. 25 “And I lay prostrate before Yahweh through forty days, and through forty nights I prostrated myself, because Yahweh intended to kill you. 26 And I prayed to Yahweh, and I said, ‘Lord Yahweh, you must not destroy your people and your inheritance whom you redeemed in your greatness, whom you brought out from Egypt with a strong hand. 27 Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; you must not pay attention to the stubbornness of this people, to their wickedness and to their sin, 28 lest the people of the land from which you brought us out from there say, “Because Yahweh was not able to bring them to the land that he promised to them and because of his hatred toward them, he has brought them out to kill them in the desert.” 29 For they are your people and your inheritance whom you brought with your great power and with your outstretched arm.’ 1 “At that time Yahweh said to me, ‘Carve for yourself two tablets of stone just as the former ones, and come up the mountain to me, and you shall make for yourself an ark of wood. 2 And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which you smashed, and you must put them in the ark.’ 3 And so I made an ark of acacia wood, and I carved two tablets of stone like the former ones, and I went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand. 4 And he wrote upon the tablets according to the first writing, the ten words that Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly, and Yahweh gave them to me. 5 And I turned, and I came down from the mountain, and I put the tablets in the ark that I had made, and they are there, just as Yahweh commanded me. 6 “And the Israelites journeyed from the wells of Bene-Yaqan to Moserah; there Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar, his son, served as a priest in place of him. 7 From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land flowing with streams of water. 8 At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to stand before Yahweh, to serve him and to bless the people in his name until this day. 9 Therefore there was not for Levi an allotment or an inheritance along with his brothers; rather Yahweh is his inheritance just as Yahweh your God promised to him. 10 And I stayed on the mountain just as during the former forty days and forty nights, and Yahweh listened to me also on that occasion; Yahweh was not willing to destroy you. 11 And Yahweh said to me, ‘Come, continue your journey before the people, so that you may go and take possession of the land that I swore to their ancestors to give to them.’ 12 And now, Israel, what is Yahweh your God asking from you, except to revere Yahweh your God, to go in all his ways and to love him and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, 13 to keep the commandments of Yahweh and his statutes that I am commanding you today for your own good. 14 Look! For to Yahweh your God belong heaven and the highest heavens, the earth and all that is in it. 15 Yet to your ancestors Yahweh was very attached, so as to love them, and so he chose their offspring after them, namely you, from all the peoples, as it is today. 16 So you shall circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and do not be stubborn. 17 For Yahweh your God, he is God of the gods and Lord of the lords, the great and mighty God, the awesome one who is not partial, and he does not take bribes. 18 And he executes justice for the orphan and widow, and he is one who loves the alien, to give to them food and clothing. 19 And you shall love the alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt. 20 Yahweh your God, you shall revere him, you shall serve him, and to him you shall cling, and by his name you shall swear. 21 He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done with you these great and awesome things that your eyes have seen. 22 With only seventy persons your ancestors went down to Egypt, but now Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of the heaven with respect to multitude. 1 “And you shall love Yahweh your God, and you shall keep his obligations and his statutes and his regulations and his commandments always. 2 And you shall realize today that it is not with your children who have not known and who have not seen the discipline of Yahweh your God—his greatness, his strong hand, and his outstretched arm, 3 and his signs and his deeds that he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to all of his land, 4 and what he did to the army of Egypt and to their horses and to their chariots, and how he made the water of the Red Sea flow over them, when they pursued after them, and so Yahweh has destroyed them, as is the case today, 5 and what he did to you in the desert until you came up to this place, 6 and what he did to Dathan and to Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, how the earth opened its mouth wide and swallowed them, their households and their tents, and all of the living creatures that were in their possession and that were following along with them in the midst of all of Israel. 7 The fact of the matter is, your own eyes have seen all of the great deeds of Yahweh that he did. 8 “And you must keep all of the commandments that I am commanding you today, so that you may have strength and you may go and you may take possession of that land to which you are crossing to take possession of it, 9 so that you may live long on the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors, to give it to them and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey. 10 For the fact is that the land that you are about to go into to take possession of it is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come out of, where you sow your seed and you give water by your foot, as in a vegetable garden. 11 But the land that you are about to cross into to take possession of it is a land of hills and valleys, and by the rain of the heaven it drinks water, 12 a land that Yahweh your God is caring for it; continually the eyes of Yahweh your God are on it, from the beginning of the year up to the end of the year. 13 “And it will happen that if you listen carefully to my commandments that I am commanding you today, to love Yahweh your God, and to serve him with all of your heart and with all of your soul, 14 then ‘I will send the rain for your land in its season, early rain and later rain, and you will gather your grain and your wine and your olive oil.

Deuteronomy,"15 And I will give vegetation in your field for your livestock, and you will eat your fill.’ 16 Take care so that your heart is not easily deceived, and you turn away, and you serve other gods, and you bow down to them. 17 And then the anger of Yahweh will be kindled against you, and he will shut up the heavens, and there shall not be rain, and so the ground will not give its produce, and you will perish quickly from the good land that Yahweh is giving to you. 18 “And you shall put these, my words, on your heart and on your inner self, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand and let them be as an emblem between your eyes. 19 And you shall teach them to your children by talking about them when you sit in your house and when you travel on the road and when you lie down and when you get up. 20 And you shall write them on the doorframes of your house and on your gates, 21 so that they may multiply your days and the days of your children on the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors to give it to them as long as heaven endures over the earth. 22 Yes, if you diligently keep all this commandment that I am commanding you to observe it, by loving Yahweh your God by walking in all his ways and by holding fast to him, 23 then Yahweh will drive out all of these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and more numerous than you. 24 Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, it shall be yours; your boundary shall be from the desert and Lebanon from the river, the river Euphrates, on up to the western sea. 25 No one can take a stand against you; your dread and your fear Yahweh your God will put on the surface of all the land where you tread, just as he promised to you. 26 “See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse: 27 the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God that I am commanding you today, 28 and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but rather you turn from the way that I am commanding you today to go after other gods that you have not known. 29 “And it will happen that when Yahweh your God has brought you to the land that you are going to, to take possession of it, then you shall pronounce the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. 30 (Are they not beyond the Jordan, toward the west, in the land of the Canaanites living in the Jordan Valley, opposite Gilgal beside the terebinth of Moreh?) 31 For you are now about to cross the Jordan to go to take possession of the land that Yahweh, your God, is giving to you, and you will take possession of it and live in it, 32 and you must diligently observe all the rules and the regulations that I am setting before you today.” 1 “These are the rules and the regulations that you must diligently observe in the land that Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, has given to you to take possession of it, during all the days that you are living on the land. 2 You must completely demolish all of the places there where they served their gods, that is, the nations whom you are about to dispossess, on the high mountains, and on the hills and under each leafy green tree. 3 And you shall break down their altars, and you shall smash their stone pillars, and their Asherah poles you must burn with fire, and the images of their gods you shall hew down, and you shall blot out their names from that place. 4 You shall not worship Yahweh your God like this. 5 But only to the place that Yahweh your God will choose from all of your tribes to place his name there as his dwelling shall you seek, and there you shall go. 6 And you shall bring there your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and your donations and your votive gifts and your freewill offerings and the firstling of your herd and your flock. 7 And you shall eat there before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice in all your endeavors, you and your family in which Yahweh your God has blessed you. 8 “You must not do just as we are doing here today, each according to all that is right in his eyes. 9 For you have not come up to now to the resting place and to the inheritance that Yahweh your God is giving to you. 10 But you will cross the Jordan, and you will settle in the land that Yahweh your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give rest to you from all your enemies from all around, and you will live securely, 11 and then at the place that Yahweh your God will choose, to let his name dwell there, there you shall bring all the things I am commanding you, your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and your donations, and all of the choice things, your votive gifts that you vow to Yahweh. 12 And you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you and your sons and your daughters and your slaves and your slave women and the Levite who is in your towns, because there is not for him a plot of ground and an inheritance with you. 13 “Take care for yourself so that you do not offer your burnt offerings at just any place that you happen to see, 14 but only at the place that Yahweh will choose among one of your tribes; there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all the things that I am commanding you. 15 “But whenever you desire you may slaughter, and you may eat meat according to the blessing of Yahweh your God that he has given to you in all of your towns; the unclean and the clean may eat it just as they would the gazelle and as the deer. 16 Only the blood you must not eat, but on the ground you must pour it like water. 17 You are not allowed to eat in your towns the tithe of your grain and your wine and your olive oil and the firstborn of your herd and your flock and all of your votive gifts that you vowed and your freewill offering and your donations. 18 But only before Yahweh your God you shall eat it, at the place that Yahweh your God will choose, you and your son and your daughter and your slave and your slave woman and the Levite who is in your towns, and you must rejoice before your God in all your undertakings. 19 Take care so that you do not neglect the Levite all of your days on your land. 20 “When Yahweh your God enlarges your territory just as he has promised to you, and you say ‘I want to eat some meat,’ because you want it, whenever you desire you may eat meat. 21 If the place that Yahweh your God will choose to put his name there is too far from you, and you slaughter any of your herd and any of your flock that Yahweh has given to you just as I have commanded you, then you may eat whenever you desire in your towns. 22 Surely just as the gazelle and the deer is eaten, so both the unclean and the clean together may eat it. 23 Only, be sure not to eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the meat. 24 You shall not eat it, but on the ground you shall pour it out like water. 25 You shall not eat it, so that it will go well for you and your children after you, because then you will be doing what is right in the eyes of Yahweh. 26 Only your holy objects that are yours and your votive gifts you must carry and you must bring to the place that Yahweh will choose. 27 And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood on the altar of Yahweh your God, and the blood of your sacrifices you shall pour out on the altar of Yahweh your God, but the meat you may eat. 28 Be careful to obey all these things that I am commanding you, so that it will go well for you and for your children after you forever, because then you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh your God. 29 “When Yahweh your God has cut off the nations whom you are about to go to, to dispossess them before you, and you have dispossessed them, and you live in their land, 30 take care so that you are not ensnared into imitating them after their being destroyed from before you, and so that you not enquire concerning their gods, saying, ‘How did these nations serve their gods, and thus I myself want to do also.’ 31 You must not do so toward Yahweh your God, because of every detestable thing they have done for their gods Yahweh hates, for even their sons and their daughters they would burn in the fire to their gods. 32 All of the things that I am commanding you, you must diligently observe; you shall not add to it, and you shall not take away from it.” 1 “If a prophet stands up in your midst or a dreamer of dreams and he gives to you a sign or wonder, 2 and the sign or the wonder comes about that he spoke to you, saying, ‘Let us go after other gods (those whom you have not known), and let us serve them,’ 3 you must not listen to the words of that prophet or to that dreamer, for Yahweh your God is testing you to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all of your heart and with all of your inner self. 4 You shall go after Yahweh your God, and him you shall revere, and his commandment you shall keep, and to his voice you shall listen, and him you shall serve, and to him you shall hold fast. 5 But that prophet or the dreamer of that dream shall be executed, for he spoke falsely about Yahweh your God, the one bringing you out from the land of Egypt and the one redeeming you from the house of slavery, in order to seduce you from the way that Yahweh your God commanded you to go in it; so in this way you shall purge the evil from your midst. 6 “If your brother, the son of your mother or your son or your daughter or your wife whom you embrace or your intimate friend in secrecy says, ‘Let us go and let us serve other gods!’ gods that you and your ancestors have not known, ",Deuteronomy 11:15-13:6,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/deuteronomy-1115136-274025/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-05-04_deuteronomy-1115136_20120423100307.mp3
Deuteronomy,"5 But that prophet or the dreamer of that dream shall be executed, for he spoke falsely about Yahweh your God, the one bringing you out from the land of Egypt and the one redeeming you from the house of slavery, in order to seduce you from the way that Yahweh your God commanded you to go in it; so in this way you shall purge the evil from your midst. 6 “If your brother, the son of your mother or your son or your daughter or your wife whom you embrace or your intimate friend in secrecy says, ‘Let us go and let us serve other gods!’ gods that you and your ancestors have not known, 7 from among the gods of the people who are around you, those near you or those far from you, from one end of the earth and up to the other end of the earth, 8 you must not give in to him, and you shall not listen to him, and your eye shall not take pity on him, and you shall not have compassion, and you shall not cover up for him. 9 But you shall certainly kill him; your hand shall be first against him to kill him and next the hand of all of the people. 10 And you shall stone him with stones and let him die, for he tried to seduce you from Yahweh your God, the one bringing you from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery. 11 And all of Israel shall hear, and they shall fear, and they shall not continue to act according to this evil thing in your midst. 12 “If you hear in one of your towns which Yahweh your God is giving to you to live in, someone saying that 13 worthless men have gone out from your midst and have seduced the inhabitants of their town, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods!’ whom you have not known, 14 then you shall inquire and examine and interrogate thoroughly, and, look! It is true; the thing has actually been done, this detestable thing in your midst, 15 then you shall certainly strike down the inhabitants of that town with the edge of the sword; you shall destroy it and everything in it, its domestic animals with the edge of the sword. 16 And then you shall gather all of its booty into the middle of its public square, and you shall burn the town and all of its war-booty totally for Yahweh your God, and it shall be a pile of rubble forever; it shall not be built again. 17 And let not something cling to your hand from the things devoted to destruction, so that Yahweh may turn back from his burning anger, and he may show compassion to you and he may continue to show compassion and so multiply you just as he swore to your ancestors, 18 if you listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep all of his commandments that I am commanding to you today so as to do the right thing in the eyes of Yahweh your God.” 1 “You are children of Yahweh your God; therefore you must not gash yourself, and you must not make your forehead bald for the dead. 2 For you are a people holy to Yahweh your God, and you Yahweh has chosen to be a treasured possession from among all of the peoples that are on the surface of the earth. 3 You shall not eat any detestable thing. 4 These are the animals you may eat: ox, sheep, goats, 5 deer, gazelle, roebuck, wild goat, ibex, antelope, and mountain sheep. 6 And any animal having a split hoof and so a dividing of the hoof into two parts and that chews the cud among the animals—that animal you may eat. 7 Only these you may not eat from those chewing the cud and from those having a division of the hoof: the camel and the hare and the coney, because they chew the cud, but they do not divide the hoof; they are therefore unclean for you. 8 And also the pig because it has a division of the hoof but does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you; from their meat you shall not eat, and you shall not touch their carcasses. 9 “This is what you shall eat from all that is in the water: everything that has fins and scales you may eat. 10 But anything that does not have fins and scales, you may not eat, for it is unclean for you. 11 “All of the birds that are clean you may eat. 12 Now these are the ones you shall not eat any of them: the eagle and the vulture and the short-toed eagle, 13 and the red kite and the black kite or any kind of falcon, 14 and any kind of crow according to its kind, 15 and the ostrich and the short-eared owl and the seagull and the hawk according to its kind, 16 the little owl and the great owl and the barn owl, 17 and the desert owl and the carrion vulture and the cormorant, 18 and the stork and the heron according to its kind and the hoopoe and the bat. 19 And also all of the winged insects; they are unclean for you; you shall not eat them. 20 You may eat any clean bird. 21 “You shall not eat any carcass; you may give it to the alien who is in your towns, and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner, for you are a holy people for Yahweh your God; you may not boil a kid in its mother’s milk. 22 “Certainly you must give a tithe of all the yield of your seed, which comes forth from your field year after year. 23 And you shall eat before Yahweh your God in the place that he will choose to make to dwell his name there the tithe of your grain, your wine and your olive oil and the firstling of your herd and your flock, so that you may learn to revere Yahweh your God always. 24 But if the distance is too great for you, so that you are not able to transport it, because the place that Yahweh your God will choose to set his name there, it is too far from you, when Yahweh your God will bless you, 25 then in that case you may exchange for money, and you shall take the money to your hand and go to the place that Yahweh your God will choose. 26 You may spend the money for anything that you desire, for oxen or for sheep or for wine or for strong drink or for anything that you desire, and you shall eat it there before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household. 27 And as to the Levite who is in your towns, you shall not neglect him, because there is not a plot of ground for him and an inheritance along with you. 28 “At the end of three years you shall bring out all of the tithe of your yield for that year, and you shall store it in your towns. 29 And so the Levite may come, because there is no plot of ground for him or an inheritance with you, and the alien also may come and the orphan and the widow that are in your towns, and they may eat their fill, so that Yahweh your God may bless you in all of the work of your hand that you undertake.” ",Deuteronomy 13:5-14:29,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/deuteronomy-1351429-275000/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-05-07_deuteronomy-1351429_20120423161302.mp3
Deuteronomy,"1 “At the end of seven years you shall grant a remission of debt. 2 And this is the manner of the remission of debt: every creditor shall remit his claim that he holds against his neighbor, and he shall not exact payment from his brother because there a remission of debt has been proclaimed unto Yahweh. 3 With respect to the foreigner you may exact payment, but you must remit what shall be owed to you with respect to your brother. 4 Nevertheless, there shall not be among you a poor person, because Yahweh will certainly bless you in the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you as an inheritance, to take possession of it. 5 If only you listen well to the voice of Yahweh your God by observing diligently all of these commandments that I am commanding you today. 6 When Yahweh your God has blessed you, just as he promised to you, then you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow from them, and you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you. 7 If there is a poor person among you from among one of your brothers in one of your towns that Yahweh your God is giving to you, you shall not harden your heart, and you shall not shut your hand toward your brother who is poor. 8 But you shall certainly open your hand for him, and you shall willingly lend to him enough to meet his need, whatever it is. 9 Take care so that there will not be a thought of wickedness in your heart, saying, ‘The seventh year, the year of the remission of debt is near,’ and you view your needy neighbor with hostility, and so you do not give to him, and he might cry out against you to Yahweh, and you would incur guilt against yourself. 10 By all means you must give to him, and you must not be discontented at your giving to him, because on account of this very thing, Yahweh your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you undertake. 11 For the poor will not cease to be among you in the land; therefore I am commanding you, saying, ‘You shall willingly open your hand to your brother, to your needy and to your poor that are in your land.’ 12 If your relative who is a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman is sold to you, and he or she has served you six years, then in the seventh year you shall send that person out free. 13 And when you send him out free from you, you shall not send him away empty-handed. 14 You shall generously supply him from among your flocks and from your threshing floor and from your press; according to that with which Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to him. 15 And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you; therefore I am commanding you thus today. 16 And then if it will happen that he says to you, ‘I do not want to go out from you,’ because he loves you and your family, because it is good for him to be with you; 17 then you shall take an awl, and you shall thrust it through his earlobe and into the door, and he shall be to you a slave forever; and you shall also do likewise for your slave woman. 18 It shall not be hard in your eyes when you send him forth free, because for six years he has served you worth twice the wage of a hired worker; and Yahweh your God will bless you in whatever you will do. 19 “Every firstling male that is born of your herd and of your flock you shall consecrate to Yahweh your God; you shall not do work with the firstling of your ox, and you shall not shear the firstling of your flock. 20 Rather before Yahweh your God you shall eat it year by year at the place Yahweh will choose, you and your household. 21 But if there is a physical defect in it, such as lameness or blindness, any serious defect, you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God. 22 In your towns you shall eat it, the unclean and the clean together may eat it, just as they eat the gazelle and as they eat the deer. 23 But you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it on the ground like water.” 1 “Observe the month of Abib, and you shall keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you out from Egypt by night. 2 And you shall offer the Passover sacrifice to Yahweh your God from among your flock and herd at the place that Yahweh will choose, to let his name dwell there. 3 You shall not eat with it anything leavened; seven days you shall eat with it unleavened bread of affliction, because in haste you went out from the land of Egypt, so that you will remember the day of your going out from the land of Egypt all the days of your life. 4 And leaven shall not be seen with you in any of your territory for seven days, and none of the meat that you will slaughter on the evening on the first day shall remain overnight until morning. 5 You are not allowed to offer the Passover sacrifice in one of your towns that Yahweh your God is giving to you, 6 but only at the place that Yahweh your God will choose, to let his name dwell there; you shall offer the Passover sacrifice in the evening at sunset, at the designated time of your going out from Egypt. 7 And you shall cook, and you shall eat it at the place that Yahweh your God will choose; and you may turn in the morning and go to your tents. 8 Six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be an assembly for Yahweh your God; you shall not do work. 9 “You shall count off seven weeks for you; from the time you begin to harvest the standing grain you shall begin to count seven weeks. 10 And then you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks for Yahweh your God with the measure of the freewill offering of your hand that you shall give just as Yahweh your God has blessed you. 11 And you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you and your son and your daughter and your slave and your slave woman and the Levite that is in your towns and the alien and the orphan and the widow who are in your midst in the place that Yahweh your God will choose to let his name dwell there. 12 And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and so you shall diligently observe these rules. 13 “You shall celebrate the Feast of Booths for yourselves seven days at the gathering in of the produce from your threshing floor and from your press; 14 and you shall rejoice at your feast, you and your son and your daughter and your slave and your slave woman and the Levite and the orphan and the widow that are in your towns. 15 Seven days you shall celebrate your feast to Yahweh your God at the place Yahweh will choose, for Yahweh your God shall bless you in all of your produce and in all of the work of your hand, and you shall surely be rejoicing. 16 Three times in the year all of your males shall appear before Yahweh your God at the place that he will choose, at the Feast of Unleavened Bread and at the Feast of Weeks and at the Feast of Booths, and they shall not appear before Yahweh empty-handed. 17 Each person shall give as he is able, that is, according to the blessing of Yahweh your God that he has given to you. 18 “You shall appoint judges and officials for you in all your towns that Yahweh your God is giving to you throughout your tribes, and you shall render for the people righteous judgments. 19 You shall not subvert justice; you shall not show partiality; and you shall not take a bribe, for the bribe makes blind the eyes of the wise and misrepresents the words of the righteous. 20 Justice, only justice you shall pursue, so that you may live, and you shall take possession of the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you. 21 You shall not plant for yourselves an Asherah pole beside the altar of Yahweh your God that you make for yourselves. 22 And you shall not set up for yourselves a stone pillar, a thing that Yahweh your God hates.

Deuteronomy,"1 “You shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox or sheep that has a physical defect of anything seriously wrong, for that is a detestable thing to Yahweh your God. 2 If there is found in one of your towns that Yahweh your God is giving to you a man or a woman that does evil in the eyes of Yahweh your God to transgress his covenant 3 and by going and serving other gods and so he bows down to them and to the sun or to the moon or to any of the host of heaven which I have forbidden, 4 and it is reported to you or you hear about it and you enquire about it thoroughly and, indeed, the trustworthiness of the deed has been established, it has occurred, this detestable thing, in Israel, 5 then you shall bring out that man or that woman who has done this evil thing to your gates; that is, the man or the woman, and you shall stone them with stones to death. 6 On the evidence of two or three witnesses the person shall be put to death. The person shall not be put to death by the mouth of one witness. 7 The hand of the witnesses shall be first against the person to kill the person, and afterward the hands of all the people, and so you shall purge the evil from your midst. 8 “If a matter is too difficult for you, for example disputes between blood and blood, between legal claim and legal claim and between assault and assault and between matters of discernment in your towns, then you shall get up and you shall go to the place that Yahweh your God will choose; 9 then you shall go to the priests and the Levites and to the judge who will be in office in those days, and you shall enquire, and they shall announce to you the verdict. 10 “And you shall carry out exactly the decision that they announced to you from that place that Yahweh will choose, and you shall diligently observe according to all that they instruct you. 11 And so according to the instruction of the law that they teach you and according to the decisions that they say to you, you shall do; you shall not turn from the word that they tell you to the right or to the left. 12 And the man who treats with contempt so as not to listen to the priest who is standing to minister on behalf of Yahweh your God or to the judge, that man shall die; so you shall purge the evil from Israel. 13 And all the people will hear and will be afraid, and they will not behave presumptuously again. 14 “When you have come to that land that Yahweh your God is giving to you and you have taken possession of it and you have settled in it, and you say, ‘I will set over me a king like all the nations that are around me,’ 15 indeed, you may set a king over you whom Yahweh your God will choose, from the midst of your countrymen you must set a king over you; you are not allowed to appoint over you a man, a foreigner, who is not your countryman. 16 Except, he may not make numerous for himself horses, and he may not allow the people to to go to Egypt in order to increase horses, for Yahweh has said to you that you may never return. 17 And he must not acquire many wives for himself, so that his heart would turn aside; and he must not accumulate silver and gold for himself excessively. 18 “And then when he is sitting on the throne of his kingdom, then he shall write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll before the Levitical priests. 19 And it shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to revere Yahweh your God by diligently observing all the word of this law and these rules, 20 so as not to exalt his heart above his countrymen and not to turn aside from the commandment to the right or to the left, so that he may reign long over his kingdom, he and his children in the midst of Israel.” 1 “And there shall not be for the Levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, a plot of ground and an inheritance with Israel, rather they may eat an offering made by fire as their inheritance, for Yahweh. 2 And there shall not be for them an inheritance of land in the midst of his brothers; rather Yahweh is his inheritance, just as he promised to them. 3 Now this shall be the share of the priest from the people, from those who sacrifice the sacrifice, whether it is an ox, sheep, or goat, and they shall give the priest the shoulder and the jawbones and the stomach. 4 The firstfruits of your grain, your wine, and your olive oil and the firstfruits of the fleece of your sheep you shall give to him. 5 For Yahweh your God has chosen him from among all your tribes to stand to minister in the name of Yahweh, he and his sons forever. 6 And if a Levite comes from one of your towns from anywhere in Israel where he is residing, he may come whenever he desires, to the place that Yahweh will choose, 7 and he may minister in the name of Yahweh his God, just like all his brothers, the Levites who stand there before Yahweh. 8 They shall eat equal portions, apart from what he may receive from the sale of his patrimony. 9 “When you come to the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you, you must not learn to do like the detestable practices of those nations. 10 There shall not be found among you one who makes his son or his daughter go through the fire, or one who practices divination, or an interpreter of signs, or an augur, or sorcerer, 11 or one who casts magic spells, or one who consults a spirit of the dead, or spiritist, or one who inquires of the dead. 12 For everyone doing these things is detestable to Yahweh, and because of these detestable things Yahweh your God is driving them out from before you. 13 You must be blameless before Yahweh your God. 14 For these nations that you are about to dispossess listen to interpreters of signs and to diviners, but Yahweh your God has not allowed you to do the same.

Deuteronomy,"15 “Yahweh your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your midst, from your countrymen, and to him you shall listen. 16 This is according to all that you asked from Yahweh your God at Horeb, on the day of the assembly, saying, ‘I do not want again to hear the voice of Yahweh my God, and I do not want to see again this great fire, so that I may not die!’ 17 And Yahweh said to me, ‘They are right in what they have said. 18 I will raise up a prophet for them from among their countrymen like you, and I will place my words into his mouth, and he shall speak to them everything that I command him. 19 And then the man that will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I will hold accountable. 20 However, the prophet that behaves presumptuously by speaking a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak, and who speaks in the name of other gods, then that prophet shall die.’ 21 And if you say to yourself, ‘How can we know the word that Yahweh has not spoken to him?’ 22 Whenever what the prophet spoke in the name of Yahweh, the thing does not take place and does not come about, that is the thing that Yahweh has not spoken to him. Presumptuously the prophet spoke it; you shall not fear that prophet.” 1 “When Yahweh your God has exterminated the nations concerning whom Yahweh your God is giving to you their land, and you have dispossessed them, and you have settled in their towns and in their houses, 2 you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land that Yahweh your God is giving to you to take possession of it. 3 You shall prepare the roads for yourselves, and you shall divide the regions of your land into thirds that Yahweh your God gives you as a possession, so that it will be available for any manslayer to flee there. 4 “Now this is the case of the manslayer who may flee there and live there who has killed his neighbor unintentionally, and he did not hate him previously. 5 For example, when somebody goes with his neighbor into the forest to cut wood, and the iron head slips from the handle of the tool and strikes his neighbor and he dies, then he may flee to one of these cities, and so he may live. 6 He does this lest the avenger of blood might pursue after the killer, because he is hot with anger and he overtakes him, because it is a long distance to the city of refuge, and so he kills him, but he did not deserve a death sentence, because he was not hating him before. 7 Therefore I am commanding you, saying, ‘You shall set apart three cities.’ 8 Then if Yahweh your God enlarges your territory just as he swore to your ancestors and gives to you all the land that he promised to give to your ancestors, 9 then if you diligently observe this entire commandment that I am commanding you today by loving Yahweh your God and by going in his ways at all times, then you shall add three more cities for yourselves to these three. 10 Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in the midst of your land that Yahweh your God is giving to you as an inheritance and thereby bloodguilt would be on you. 11 But if someone hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and rises up against him and murders him, and the murderer flees to one of these cities, 12 then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there, and they shall give him into the hand of the avenger of blood, and he shall be put to death. 13 Your eye shall not take pity on him, and you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, so that good will be directed toward you. 14 “You shall not move the boundary marker of your neighbor that former generations set up on your property in the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you to take possession of it. 15 The testimony of a single witness may not be used to convict with respect to any crime and for any wrongdoing in any offense that a person committed; on the evidence of two witnesses or on the evidence of three witnesses a charge shall be sustained. 16 If a malicious witness gets up to accuse anyone to testify against him falsely, 17 then the two men to whom the legal dispute pertains shall stand before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who are in office in those days. 18 Then judges shall make a thorough inquiry, and if it turns out that the witness is a false witness and he testified falsely against his brother, 19 then you shall do to him as he meant to do to his brother, and so you shall purge the evil from your midst. 20 And the rest shall hear and shall fear, and they shall not continue to do such a thing again as this evil thing in your midst. 21 You must show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.” ",Deuteronomy 18:15-19:21,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/deuteronomy-18151921-275003/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-05-10_deuteronomy-18151921_20120423161707.mp3
Deuteronomy,"1 “If you go out to war against your enemies and you see a horse and a chariot, an army larger that you, you shall not be afraid because of them; for Yahweh your God is with you, the one who brought you from the land of Egypt. 2 And then when you approach the battle, then the priest shall come near and speak to the troops. 3 And he shall say to them, ‘Hear, Israel, you are near today to the battle against your enemies; do not lose heart; you shall not be afraid, and you shall not panic, and you shall not be terrified because of them, 4 for Yahweh your God is going with you to fight for you against your enemies to help you.’ 5 And the officials shall speak to the troops, saying, ‘Who is the man who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to this house, so that he does not die in battle and another man dedicates it. 6 And who is the man that has planted a vineyard and has not enjoyed it? Let him go and let him return to his house, so that he does not die in battle and another man enjoys it. 7 And who is the man who got engaged to a woman and has not married her? Let him go and let him return to his house, so that he does not die in battle and another man marries her.’ 8 And the officials shall continue to speak to the troops, and they shall say, ‘What man is afraid and disheartened? Let him go, and let him return to his house, and let him not cause the heart of his brothers to melt like his.’ 9 And when the officials have finished speaking to the army troops, then they shall appoint commanders of divisions at the head of the troops. 10 “When you approach a city to fight against it, you must offer it peace. 11 And then if they accept your terms of peace and they surrender to you, and then all the people inhabiting it shall be forced labor for you, and they shall serve you. 12 But if they do not accept your terms of peace and they want to make war with you, then you shall lay siege against it. 13 And Yahweh your God will give it into your hand, and you shall kill all its males with the edge of the sword. 14 Only the women and the little children and the domestic animals and all that shall be in the city, all of its spoil you may loot for yourselves, and you may enjoy the spoil of your enemies that Yahweh you God has given to you. 15 Thus you shall do to all the far cities from you, which are not from the cities of these nations located nearby. 16 But from the cities of these peoples that Yahweh your God is giving to you as an inheritance, you shall not let anything live that breathes. 17 Rather, you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, just as Yahweh your God has commanded you, 18 so that they may not teach you to do like all their detestable things that they do for their gods and thereby you sin against Yahweh your God. 19 “If you besiege a town for many days to make war against it in order to seize it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them, for you may eat from them, and so you must not cut them down. Are the trees of the field humans that they should come in siege against you? 20 Only the trees that you know are not fruit trees you may destroy and you may cut down, and you may build siege works against that city that is making war with you until it falls.” 1 “If someone slain is found in the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you to take possession of it and is lying in the field, and it is not known who killed him, 2 then your elders and your judges shall go out and shall measure the distance to the cities that are around the slain one. 3 And then the nearest city to the slain one, the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd that has not been worked with in the field, that has not pulled a yoke, 4 and the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a wadi that flows with water all year and that has not been plowed and has not been sown; then there they shall break the neck of the heifer in the wadi. 5 Then the priests, the descendants of Levi, shall come near, for Yahweh your God has chosen them to bless in the name of Yahweh, and every legal dispute and every case of assault will be subject to their ruling. 6 And all of the elders of that city nearest to the slain person shall wash their hands over the heifer with the broken neck in the wadi. 7 And they shall declare, and they shall say, ‘Our hands did not shed this blood, and our eyes did not see what was done. 8 Forgive your people, Israel, whom you redeemed, Yahweh, and do not allow the guilt of innocent blood in the midst of your people Israel, and let them be forgiven with regard to blood.’ 9 And so you shall purge the innocent blood from your midst, because you must do the right thing in the eyes of Yahweh. 10 “When you go out for battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your God gives them into your hand, and you lead the captives away, 11 and you see among the captives a woman beautiful in appearance, and you become attached to her and you want to take her as a wife, 12 then you shall bring her into your household, and she shall shave her head, and she shall trim her nails. 13 And she shall remove the clothing of her captivity from her, and she shall remain in your house, and she shall mourn her father and her mother a full month, and after this you may have sex with her, and you may marry her, and she may become your wife. 14 And then if you do not take delight in her, then you shall let her go to do whatever she wants, but you shall not treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her. 15 “If a man has two wives, and the one is loved and the other one is disliked and the one loved and the one that is disliked have borne for him sons, if it happens that the firstborn son belongs to the one that is disliked, 16 nevertheless it will be the case that on the day of bestowing his inheritance upon his sons, he will not be allowed to treat as the firstborn son the son of the beloved wife in preference to the son of the disliked wife, who is the firstborn son. 17 But he shall acknowledge the firstborn son of the disliked wife by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the firstfruit of his vigor; to him is the legal claim of the birthright. 18 “If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not listen to the voice of his father and to the voice of his mother, and they discipline him, and he does not obey them, 19 then his father and his mother shall take hold of him, and they shall bring him out to the elders of his city and to the gate of his town, 20 and they shall say to the elders of his city, ‘This our son is stubborn and rebellious; he does not obey us, and he is a glutton and a drunkard.’ 21 Then all the men of his city shall stone him with stones and let him die; and so you shall purge the evil from your midst, and all of Israel will hear, and they will fear.

Deuteronomy,"22 “And if a man commits a sin punishable by death, and so he is put to death and you hang him on a tree, 23 his dead body shall not hang on the tree, but certainly you shall bury him on that day, for cursed by God is one that is being hung; so you shall not defile your land that Yahweh your God is giving to you as an inheritance.” 1 “You shall not watch the ox of your neighbor or his sheep or goat straying and ignore them; certainly you shall return them to your neighbor. 2 And if your countryman is not near you or you do not know who he is, then you shall bring it to your household, and it shall be with you until your countryman seeks after it, and you shall return it to him. 3 And thus also you shall do regarding his donkey, and thus you shall do concerning his garment, and so you shall do with respect to all of the lost property of your countryman that is lost from him and you find it; you are not allowed to withhold help. 4 “You shall not see the donkey of your neighbor or his ox fallen on the road and you ignore them; certainly you must help them get up along with him. 5 “The apparel of a man shall not be put on a woman, and a man shall not wear the clothing of a woman, because everyone who does these things is detestable to Yahweh your God. 6 “If a bird’s nest is found before you on the road in any tree or on the ground, and there are chicks or eggs, and the mother is lying down on the chicks or the eggs, you shall not take the mother along with the young; 7 you shall certainly let the mother go, but you may take the young for yourselves; do this so that it may go well for you and you may live long in the land. 8 “When you build a new house then you shall make a parapet wall for your roof, so that you will not bring bloodguilt on your house if anyone should fall from it. 9 “You shall not sow your vineyard with differing kinds of seed, so that you shall not forfeit the whole harvest, both the seed that you sowed and the yield of the vineyard. 10 “You shall not plow with an ox and with a donkey yoked together. 11 “You shall not wear woven material made of wool and linen mixed together. 12 “You shall make tassels for yourselves on the four corners of your clothing with which you cover yourself. 13 “If a man takes a woman and he has sex with her, but he then dislikes her, 14 and he accuses her falsely, and he defames her, and he says ‘This woman I took and I lay with her and I discovered that she was not a virgin,’ 15 then in defense the father of the young woman shall take, along with her mother, and together they must bring out the evidence of the virginity of the young woman to display it to the elders of the city at the city gate. 16 And then the father of the young woman shall say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man as wife, but he now dislikes her, 17 and now look he has accused her falsely, saying, “I did not find your daughter a virgin,” but here is evidence of the virginity of my daughter’; and they shall spread the cloth out before the elders of the city. 18 Then the elders of that city shall take the man, and they shall discipline him. 19 Then they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and they shall give them to the father of the young woman, for he defamed an Israelite young woman, and she shall become his wife; he will not be allowed to divorce her all his days. 20 “But if this charge was true, and the signs of virginity were not found for the young woman, 21 and then they shall bring out the young woman to the doorway of the house of her father, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones, and she shall die, because she did a disgraceful thing in Israel by playing the harlot in the house of her father, and so you shall purge the evil from your midst. 22 “If a man is found lying with a married woman, then they shall both die; both of them, the man who lay with the woman and the woman also, so you shall purge the evil from Israel. 23 “If it happens that a young woman, a virgin, is engaged to a man, and a man finds her in the town and lies with her, 24 then you shall bring out both of them to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them with stones so that they shall die, the young woman because she did not cry out in the town, and the man because he violated his neighbor’s wife; and so you shall purge the evil from your midst. 25 “But if the man finds the young engaged woman in the field and the man overpowers her and he has sex with her, then the man only must die who lay with her. 26 But you shall not do anything to the young woman, for there is not reckoned against the young woman a sin deserving death; it is similar to when a man rises up against his neighbor and murders him, a fellow human being, just so is this case, 27 for he found her in the field, the engaged young woman cried out, but there was no rescuer to help her. 28 “If a man finds a young woman, a virgin who is not engaged, and he seizes her and he has sex with her and they are caught, 29 then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and she shall become his wife because he violated her, and he is not allowed to divorce her during his lifetime. 30 A man may not take the wife of his father, and so he may not dishonor his father. 1 “No man with crushed testicles or whose male organ is cut off may come into the assembly of Yahweh.

Deuteronomy,"1 “No man with crushed testicles or whose male organ is cut off may come into the assembly of Yahweh. 2 An illegitimate child may not come into the assembly of Yahweh; even to the tenth generation none of his descendants may come into the assembly of Yahweh. 3 An Ammonite or a Moabite may not come into the assembly of Yahweh; even to the tenth generation none of his descendants may come into the assembly of Yahweh forever, 4 because they did not come to meet you with food and with water when you came out of Egypt, and also because they hired Balaam, son of Beor, from Pethor, in Aram Naharaim to act against you to curse you. 5 But Yahweh your God was not willing to listen to Balaam, and Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because Yahweh your God loved you. 6 You shall not promote their welfare or their prosperity all your days forever. 7 “You shall not abhor an Edomite, because he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian because you were an alien in his land. 8 The children that are born to them in the third generation may come representing them in the assembly of Yahweh. 9 “If you go out to encamp against your enemies, then you shall guard against doing anything evil. 10 “If there is among you a man that is not clean because of a seminal emission during the night, he shall go outside the camp; he shall not come within the camp. 11 And then toward the coming of the evening, he shall bathe with water, and at the going down of the sun, he may come to the midst of the camp. 12 “And there shall be for you a designated place outside the camp; and you shall go there to relieve yourself, 13 and a digging tool shall be included in addition to your other utensils for yourself; and then when you relieve yourself outside the camp you shall dig with it, and then you shall turn, and you shall cover your excrement. 14 For Yahweh your God is walking about in the midst of your camp to deliver you and to hand your enemies over to you before you, and so let your camp be holy, so that he shall not see in it anything indecent, and he shall turn away from going with you. 15 “And you shall not hand over a slave to his master who has escaped and fled to you from his master. 16 He shall reside with you in your midst in the place that he chooses in one of your towns wherever he pleases; you shall not oppress him. 17 “No woman of Israel shall be a temple prostitute, and no man of Israel shall be a male shrine prostitute. 18 You may not bring the hire of a prostitute or the earnings of a male prostitute into the house of Yahweh your God, for any vow offerings, because both are a detestable thing to Yahweh your God. 19 “You shall not charge your brother interest on money, interest on food, or interest on anything that one could lend on interest. 20 You may lend on interest to the foreigner, but to your countryman you may not lend on interest, so that Yahweh your God may bless you in all your undertakings in the land where you are going, in order to take possession of it. 21 “When you make a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not postpone fulfillment of it, for certainly Yahweh your God shall require it from you and if postponed you will incur guilt. 22 And if you refrain from vowing, you shall not incur guilt. 23 The utterance of your lips you must perform diligently just as you have vowed freely to Yahweh your God whatever it was that you promised with your mouth. 24 “When you come into the vineyard of your neighbor, then you may eat grapes as you please and until you are full, but you shall not put any into your container. 25 “When you come into the standing grain of your neighbor, then you may pluck ears with your hand, but you may not swing a sickle among the standing grain of your neighbor.” 1 “When a man takes a wife and he marries her and then she does not please him, because he found something objectionable and writes her a letter of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her away from his house, 2 and she goes from his house, and she goes out and becomes a wife for another man, 3 and then the second man dislikes her and he writes her a letter of divorce and places it into her hand and sends her from his house, or if the second man dies who took her to himself as a wife, 4 her first husband who sent her away is not allowed to take her again to become a wife to him after she has been defiled, for that is a detestable thing before Yahweh, and so you shall not mislead into sin the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you as an inheritance. 5 “When a man takes a new wife he shall not go out with the army, and he shall not be obligated with anything; he shall be free from obligation, to stay at home for one year, and he shall bring joy to his wife that he took. 6 “A person shall not take a pair of millstones or an upper millstone, for he is taking necessities of life as a pledge. 7 “If a man is caught kidnapping somebody from among his countrymen, the Israelites, and he treats him as a slave or he sells him, then that kidnapper shall die, and so you shall purge the evil from among you. 8 Be watchful with respect to an outbreak of any infectious skin disease, by being very careful and by acting according to all that the priests and the Levites have instructed you, just as I have commanded them, so you shall diligently observe. 9 So remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam on the journey when you went out from Egypt. 10 “When you make a loan to your neighbor, a loan of any kind, you shall not go into his house to take his pledge. 11 You shall wait outside, and the man to whom you are lending, he shall bring the pledge outside to you. 12 And if he is a needy man, you shall not sleep in his pledge. 13 You shall certainly return the pledge to him as the sun sets, so that he may sleep in his cloak and may bless you, and it shall be considered righteousness on your behalf before Yahweh your God. 14 “You shall not exploit a hired worker, who is needy and poor, from among your fellow men or from among your aliens who are in your land and in your towns. 15 On his day you shall give his wage, and the sun shall not go down, because he is poor and his life depends on it; do this so that he does not cry out against you to Yahweh, and you incur guilt. 16 “Fathers shall not be put to death because of their children, and children shall not be put to death because of their fathers;

Deuteronomy,"1 “When a legal dispute takes place between men and they come near to the court, and the judges judge with respect to them, then they shall declare the righteous to be in the right and they shall condemn the wicked, 2 then it will happen if the guilty one deserves beating, then the judge shall make him lie, and he shall beat him before him, according to the prescribed number of lashes proportionate to the offense. 3 He may beat him with forty lashes, and he shall not do more than these, so that he will not beat more in addition to these many blows, and your countryman would be degraded before your eyes. 4 “You shall not muzzle an ox when he is threshing. 5 “When brothers dwell together and one of them dies and has no son, the wife of the deceased shall not become the wife of a man of another family; her brother-in-law shall have sex with her, and he shall take her to himself as a wife, and he shall perform his duty as a brother-in-law with respect to her. 6 And then the firstborn that she bears shall represent his dead brother, so that his name is not blotted out from Israel. 7 But if the man does not want to take his sister-in-law, then his sister-in-law shall go up to the gate, to the elders, and she shall say, ‘My brother-in-law refused to perpetuate his brother’s name in Israel, for he is not willing to marry me.’ 8 Then the elders of his town shall summon him and speak to him, and if he persists and says, ‘I do not desire to marry her’ 9 then his sister-in-law shall go near him before the eyes of the elders, and she shall pull off his sandal from his foot, and she shall spit in his face, and she shall declare and she shall say, ‘This is how it is done to the man who does not build the house of his brother.’ 10 And his family shall be called in Israel, ‘The house where the sandal was pulled off.’ 11 “If a man and his brother fight each other and the wife of the one man comes near to rescue her husband from the hand of his attacker and she stretches out her hand and she seizes his genitals, 12 then you shall cut off her hand; your eye shall not take pity. 13 “There shall not be for your use in your bag two kinds of stone weights, a large one and a small one. 14 There shall not be in your house for your use two kinds of measures. 15 Rather a full and honest weight shall be for your use; there shall be for you a full and honest measure, so that your days on the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you may be long. 16 For detestable to Yahweh your God is everyone who is doing such things, everyone who is acting dishonestly. 17 “Remember what Amalek did to you on the journey when you went out from Egypt, 18 that he met you on the journey and attacked you, all those lagging behind you and when you were weary and worn out, and he did not fear God. 19 And when Yahweh your God gives rest to you from all your enemies from around about you in the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you as an inheritance to take possession of it, you shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens; you shall not forget!” 1 “And then when you come to the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you as an inheritance, and you take possession of it and you settle in it, 2 then you shall take from the firstfruit of all the fruit of the ground that you harvest from your land that Yahweh your God is giving to you, and you shall put it in a basket, and you shall go to the place that Yahweh your God will choose to make his name to dwell there. 3 And you shall go to the priest who is in office in those days, and you shall say, ‘I declare today to Yahweh your God that I have come into the land that Yahweh swore to our ancestors to give to us.’ 4 Then the priest takes the basket from your hand and places it before the altar of Yahweh your God. 5 And you shall declare and you shall say before your God, ‘My ancestor was a wandering Aramean, and he went down to Egypt, and there he dwelt as an alien few in number, and there he became a great nation, mighty and numerous. 6 And the Egyptians treated us badly, and they oppressed us and imposed on us hard labor. 7 And we cried to Yahweh, the God of our ancestors, and Yahweh heard our voice and saw our affliction and our toil and our oppression. 8 And Yahweh brought us out from Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror and with signs and with wonders. 9 And he brought us to this place and gave to us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 10 And now, look, I am bringing the firstfruit of the fruit of the ground that you gave to me, Yahweh,’ and you shall place it before Yahweh your God, and you shall bow down before Yahweh your God. 11 And you shall celebrate with all of the bounty that Yahweh your God gave to you and to your family, you and the Levite and the alien who is in your midst. 12 “When you are finished giving a tithe, all of the tithe of your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, then you shall give to the Levite, to the alien, to the orphan, and to the widow, so that they may eat in your towns and they may be satisfied. 13 And you shall say before Yahweh your God, ‘I have removed the sacred portion from the house and, moreover, I have given it to the Levite and to the alien and to the orphan and to the widow according to all your commandment that you commanded me; I have not transgressed any of your commandments, and I have not forgotten any of them. 14 I have not eaten during my time of mourning, and I have not removed anything from it while being unclean, and I have not offered any of it to someone who has died. I have listened to the voice of Yahweh my God; I have done all that you commanded me to do. 15 Look down from the dwelling place of your holiness, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the land that you have given to us, as you swore to our ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.’ 16 “This day Yahweh your God is commanding you to do these rules and regulations, and you must observe them diligently with all your heart and with all your soul. 17 Yahweh you have declared today to be for you as your God, and to go in his ways and to observe his rules and his commandments and his regulations and to listen to his voice. 18 And Yahweh has declared you today to be for him as a people, a treasured possession, as he promised to you, and that you are to observe all his commandments, 19 and that he then will set you high above all the nations that he has made for his praise and for fame and for honor and for you to be a holy people to Yahweh your God, as he promised.” ","Deuteronomy 25,26",http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/deuteronomy-25-26-275009/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-05-16_deuteronomy-25-26_20120423162103.mp3
Deuteronomy,"1 Then Moses and the elders of Israel charged the people, saying, “Keep all of the commandment that I am commanding you today. 2 And then on the day that you cross the Jordan to the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you, then you shall set up for yourselves large stones, and you shall paint them with lime, 3 and you shall write on them all the words of this law at your crossing, so that you may come into the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, promised to you. 4 And when you cross the Jordan, you shall set up these stones that I am commanding you about today on Mount Ebal, and you shall paint them with lime. 5 And you shall build an altar there for Yahweh your God, an altar of stone, but you shall not use an iron tool to shape the stones. 6 You must build the altar of your God with unhewn stones, and you shall sacrifice on it burnt offerings to Yahweh your God. 7 And you shall sacrifice fellowship offerings, and you shall eat them there, and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God. 8 You shall write on the stone all of the words of this law very clearly.” 9 Then Moses and the priests, the Levites, spoke to all Israel, saying, “Be silent and hear, Israel, for this day you have become a people for Yahweh your God. 10 And listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, and observe his commandments and his rules that I am commanding you today.” 11 And Moses charged the people on that day, saying, 12 “These tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people when you cross the Jordan: Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Joseph and Benjamin. 13 And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for delivering the curse: Reuben, Gad and Asher and Zebulun, Dan and Naphtali. 14 And the Levites shall declare, and they shall say to each man of Israel with a loud voice, 15 ‘Cursed be the man that makes a divine image or a cast image, which is a detestable thing for Yahweh, the work of the hand of a skilled craftsman, and then sets it in a hiding place.’ And all the people shall respond, ‘Amen.’ 16 ‘Cursed be the one who dishonors his father or his mother.’ And all of the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ 17 ‘Cursed be the one who moves the boundary marker of his neighbor.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ 18 ‘Cursed be the one who misleads a blind person on the road.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ 19 ‘Cursed be the one who deprives the alien, the orphan, and the widow of justice.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ 20 ‘Cursed be the one who lies with the wife of his father, because he has dishonored his father’s bed.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ 21 ‘Cursed be the one who lies with any kind of animal.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ 22 ‘Cursed be the one who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ 23 ‘Cursed be the one who lies with his mother-in-law.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ 24 ‘Cursed be the one who strikes down his neighbor in secret.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ 25 ‘Cursed be the one who takes a bribe to murder an innocent person.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ 26 ‘Cursed be the one who does not keep the words of this law, to observe them.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ ” 1 “And it will happen that if you indeed listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to diligently observe all his commandments that I am commanding you today, then Yahweh your God will set you above all the nations of the earth. 2 And all of these blessings shall come upon you, and they shall have an effect on you if you listen to the voice of Yahweh your God: 3 “You will be blessed in the city, and you will be blessed in the field. 4 “Blessed will be the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground and the fruit of your livestock, the calf of your cattle and the lambs of your flock. 5 “Blessed will be your basket and your kneading trough. 6 “Blessed will you be when you come in and blessed will you be when you go out. 7 “Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you; on one road they shall come out against you, but on seven roads they shall flee before you. 8 Yahweh will command concerning you the blessing to be in your barns and in all your endeavors; and he will bless you in the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you. 9 Yahweh will establish you for himself as a holy people as he has sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of Yahweh your God and you walk in his ways. 10 And all of the peoples of the earth shall see that by the name of Yahweh you are called, and they shall fear you. 11 And Yahweh will make you successful and prosperous, in the fruit of your womb and on the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors to give to you. 12 Yahweh shall open for you his rich storehouse, even the heavens, to give the rain for your land in its time and to bless all of the work of your hand, and you will lend to many nations; you will not borrow from them. 13 And Yahweh shall make you as head and not the tail, and you shall be only at the top of the nations, and you shall not be at the bottom, if you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God that I am commanding you today and diligently observe them. 14 And you shall not turn aside from any of the words that I am commanding you today to the right or left by going after other gods to serve them. 15 “And then if you do not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God by diligently observing all of his commandments and his statutes that I am commanding you today, then all of these curses shall come upon you, and they shall overtake you: 16 “You shall be cursed in the city, and you shall be cursed in the field. 17 “Your basket shall be cursed and your kneading trough. 18 “The fruit of your womb shall be cursed and the fruit of you ground, the calves of your cattle and the lambs of your flock. 19 “You shall be cursed when you come in, and you shall be cursed when you go out. 20 “Yahweh will send upon you the curse, the panic, and the threat in everything that you undertake, until you are destroyed and until you perish quickly because of the evil of your deeds in that you have forsaken me. 21 Yahweh will cause the plague to cling to you until it consumes you from the land that you are going to, to take possession of it. 22 Yahweh will afflict you with the wasting diseases and with the fever and with the inflammation and with the scorching heat and with the sword and with the blight and with the mildew, and they shall pursue you until you perish. 23 And your heavens that are over your heads shall be like bronze, and the earth that is under you shall be like iron. 24 Yahweh will change the rain of your land to fine dust and to sand; from the heaven it shall come down upon you until you are destroyed. 25 “Yahweh shall cause you to be defeated before your enemies; on one road you shall go against them, but you will flee on seven roads before them, and you shall become a thing of horror to all of the kingdoms of the earth. 26 And your dead bodies shall be as food for all of the birds of the heaven and to the animals of the earth, and there shall not be anyone to frighten them away. 27 “Yahweh shall afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors and with the scurvy and with the skin rash that cannot be healed. 28 Yahweh shall afflict you with madness and with blindness and with confusion of heart. 29 And you shall be groping at noon just as the blind person gropes in the dark, and you shall not succeed in finding your way, and you shall only be abused and robbed all the time, and there will not be anyone who will rescue you. 30 You shall become engaged to a woman, but another man shall sleep with her; you shall build a house, but you shall not live in it; a vineyard you shall plant, but you shall not enjoy it. 31 Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes, and you shall not eat it; your donkey shall be stolen right before you, and it shall not be returned to you; your sheep and your goats shall be given to your enemies, and there shall not be anyone who rescues you. 32 Your sons and your daughters shall be given to other people, and you will be looking on longingly for them all day, but you will be powerless to do anything. 33 A people that you do not know shall consume the harvest of your land and all your labor, and you will be only oppressed and crushed for the rest of your lives. 34 You shall become mad because of what your eyes shall see. 35 Yahweh shall strike you with grievous boils on the knees and on the upper thighs from which you will not be able to be healed, from the sole of your foot and up to your crown. 36 Yahweh will bring you and your king whom you set up over you to a nation that you or your ancestors have not known, and there you will serve other gods of wood and stone. 37 And you will become a horror and a proverb and ridicule among all the peoples where Yahweh drives you there. 38 “You shall carry out much seed to the field, but you shall gather little produce, for the locust shall devour it. 39 You shall plant vineyards and you shall dress them, but you shall not drink wine and you shall not gather grapes, for the worm shall eat it. 40 There shall be olive trees for you in all of your territory, but you shall not anoint yourself, for your olives shall drop off. 41 You shall bear sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours, for they shall go into captivity. 42 The cricket shall take possession of all your trees and the fruit of your ground. 43 The alien that is in your midst shall ascend over you, higher and higher, but you shall go down lower and lower. 44 He shall lend to you, but you shall not lend to him; he shall be the head, but you shall be the tail. 45 “And all of these curses shall come over you, and they shall pursue you, and they shall overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, by observing his commandments and his statutes that he commanded you. 46 And they shall be among you as a sign and as a wonder and among your offspring forever. 47 “Because of the fact that you did not serve Yahweh your God with joy and with gladness of heart for the abundance of everything, 48 then you shall serve your enemies, whom Yahweh will send against you under conditions of famine, in thirst, in nakedness, and in a lack of everything; and he shall place a yoke of iron on your neck until he has destroyed you. 49 Yahweh will raise up against you a nation from far off, from the end of the earth, attacking as the eagle swoops down, a nation whose language you will not understand, 50 a grim-faced nation who does not show respect to the old and the young and does not show pity. 51 And it shall consume the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your ground until you are destroyed, and who will not leave for you any grain, wine, and olive oil, calves of your herds, and lambs of your flock until it has destroyed you. 52 And it shall besiege you in all your towns until your high and fortified walls fall, which you are trusting in throughout your land; and it shall besiege you in all of your towns in all of your land that Yahweh your God has given to you. 53 And you shall eat the fruit of your womb, the flesh of your sons and your daughters, whom Yahweh your God gave to you, during the siege and during the distress your enemy inflicts upon you. 54 The most refined and the very sensitive man among you shall be mean with his brother and against his beloved wife and against the rest of his children that he has left over, 55 by refraining from giving to even one of them any of the meat of his children that he eats, because there is not anything that is left over for him during the siege and distress that your enemy inflicts upon you. 56 The most refined and the most delicate woman among you, who shall not venture to put the sole of her foot on the ground from being so delicate and from such gentleness, shall be mean to her beloved husband and against her son and against her daughter, 57 and even concerning her afterbirth that goes out from between her feet and also concerning her children that she bears, because she eats them for lack of anything in secret during the siege and during the distress that your enemy inflicts upon her in your towns. 58 “If you do not diligently observe all the words of this law written in this scroll by revering this glorious and awesome name, Yahweh your God, 59 then Yahweh shall overwhelm you with your plagues and the plagues of your offspring, severe plagues and lasting illnesses, grievous and enduring. 60 And he shall bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt concerning which you were in dread because of them. 61 Also any illness and any plague that is not written in the scroll of this law, he shall bring them, Yahweh, upon you until you are destroyed. 62 And you shall remain only a few people in place of the fact you were formerly as the stars of heaven as far as number is concerned, because you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God. 63 And then as Yahweh delighted over you to make you prosperous to make you numerous, so Yahweh shall delight over you to exterminate you and to destroy you, and so you shall be plucked from the land that you are going there to take possession of it. 64 And Yahweh shall scatter you among all the nations from one end of the earth up to the other end of the earth, and there you shall serve other gods that you have not known nor your ancestors, gods of wood and stone. 65 And among these nations you shall not find rest, and there shall not be a resting place for the sole of your foot, and Yahweh shall give you there an anxious heart and a weakening of eyes and a languishing of your inner self. 66 And your life shall hang in doubt before you, and you shall be startled night and day, and you shall not be confident of your life. 67 In the morning you shall say, ‘If only it was evening!’ and in the evening you shall say ‘If only it was morning!’ because of the dread of your heart that you shall feel, and because of the sight of your eyes that you shall see. 68 And Yahweh shall bring you back to Egypt in ships by the route that I promised to you that ‘You shall not see it again!’ And you shall sell yourself there to your enemies as slaves and as female slaves, but there will not be a buyer.” ","Deuteronomy 27,28",http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/deuteronomy-27-28-275014/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-05-17_deuteronomy-27-28_20120423162105.mp3
Deuteronomy,"1 These are the words of the covenant that Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in the land of Moab besides the covenant that he made with them at Horeb. 2 And Moses summoned all of Israel and said to them, “You saw all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt and to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land; 3 that is, the great trials that your eyes saw, and those great signs and wonders. 4 But Yahweh has not given to you a heart to understand, or eyes to see, or ears to hear, even to this day. 5 And I have led you forty years in the desert; your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandal has not worn out on your foot. 6 You have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine and strong drink, so that you may know that I am Yahweh your God. 7 And when you came to this place then Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out to meet you for battle, and we defeated them. 8 And we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to the half-tribe of Manasseh. 9 And you must diligently observe the words of this covenant, so that you may succeed in all that you do. 10 “You are standing today, all of you, before Yahweh your God, your leaders, your tribes, your elders, and your officials, all the men of Israel, 11 your little children, your women and your aliens who are in the midst of your camp, from the choppers of your wood to the drawers of your water, 12 in order for you to enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God, and into his oath that Yahweh your God is making with you today, 13 in order to establish you today to himself as a people and so that he may be for you as God, just as he promised to you and just as he swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 14 “Now I am not making this covenant and this oath with you alone. 15 But with whoever is standing here with us today before Yahweh our God, and with whoever is not standing here with us today. 16 For you know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we traveled through the midst of the nations that you traveled through. 17 And you have seen their detestable things and their idols of wood and stone, silver, and gold that were among them, 18 so that there is not among you a man or a woman or a clan or a tribe whose heart turns today from being with Yahweh our God to go to serve the gods of these nations, so that there is not among you a root sprouting poison and wormwood. 19 And then when he hears the words of this oath, then he will assure himself in his heart, saying, ‘Safety shall be mine even though I go in the stubbornness of my heart,’ thereby destroying the well-watered land along with the parched. 20 Yahweh will not be willing to forgive him, for by then the anger of Yahweh will smoke, and his passion against that man and all the curses written in this scroll will descend on him, and Yahweh will blot out his name from under heaven. 21 And Yahweh will single him out for calamity out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in the scroll of this law. 22 “And the next generation, that is, your children who will rise up after you, and the foreigner who will come from a distant land, when they will see the plagues of that land and its diseases that Yahweh has inflicted upon it, will say, 23 ‘All its land is brimstone and salt left by fire, none of its land will be sown, and it will not make plants sprout out and it will not grow any vegetation; it is as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Adman and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overturned in his anger and in his wrath.’ 24 And all the nations will say, ‘Why has Yahweh done such a thing to this land? What caused the fierceness of this great anger?’ 25 And they will say, ‘It is because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, which he made with them when he brought them out from the land of Egypt. 26 And they went and served other gods and bowed down to them, gods whom they did not know them and he had not allotted to them. 27 So the anger of Yahweh was kindled against that land to bring upon it all the curses written in this scroll, 28 and Yahweh uprooted them from their land in anger and in wrath and in great fury, and he cast them into another land, just as it is today.’ 29 “The hidden things belong to Yahweh our God, but the revealed things belong to us to know and to our children forever, in order to do all the words of this law.” 1 “And then when all of these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse that I have set before you and you call them to mind among the nations there where Yahweh your God has scattered you, 2 and you return to Yahweh and you listen to his voice according to all that I am commanding you today, both you and your children, with all your heart and with all your inner self, 3 and Yahweh your God will restore your fortunes, and he will have compassion upon you, and he will again gather you together from all the peoples where Yahweh your God scattered you there. 4 “Even if you are outcasts at the end of the heavens, even from there Yahweh your God shall gather you, and from there he shall bring you back. 5 And Yahweh your God will bring you to the land that your ancestors had taken possession of, and he will make you successful, and he will make you more numerous than your ancestors. 6 “And Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring to love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your inner self so that you may live. 7 And Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, on those who harassed you. 8 And you will again listen to the voice of Yahweh, and you will do all his commandments that I am commanding you today. 9 And Yahweh your God will make you prosperous in all your undertakings, and in the fruit of your livestock and in the fruit of your ground abundantly, for Yahweh will again rejoice over you, just as he rejoiced over your ancestors. 10 He will do this if you listen to the voice of Yahweh your God by keeping his commandment and his statutes written in the scroll of this law and if you return to Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your inner self. 11 “For this commandment that I am commanding you today is not too wonderful for you, and it is not too far from you. 12 It is not in the heavens so that you might say, ‘Who will go up for us to the heavens and get it for us and cause us to hear it, so that we may do it?’ 13 And it is not beyond the sea, so that you might say, ‘Who will cross for us to the other side of the sea and take it for us and cause us to hear it, so that we may do it?’ ",Deuteronomy 29:1-30:13,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/deuteronomy-2913013-275018/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-05-18_deuteronomy-2913013_20120423162106.mp3
Deuteronomy,"12 It is not in the heavens so that you might say, ‘Who will go up for us to the heavens and get it for us and cause us to hear it, so that we may do it?’ 13 And it is not beyond the sea, so that you might say, ‘Who will cross for us to the other side of the sea and take it for us and cause us to hear it, so that we may do it?’ 14 But the word is very near you, even in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may do it. 15 “See, I am setting before you today life and prosperity and death and disaster; 16 what I am commanding you today is to love Yahweh your God by going in his ways and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his regulations, and then you will live, and you will become numerous, and Yahweh your God will bless you in the land where you are going. 17 However, if your heart turns aside and you do not listen and you are lured away and you bow down to other gods and you serve them, 18 I declare to you today that you will certainly perish; you will not extend your time on the land that you are crossing the Jordan to go there to take possession of it. 19 I invoke as a witness against you today the heaven and the earth: life and death I have set before you, blessing and curse. So choose life, so that you may live, you and your offspring, 20 by loving Yahweh your God by listening to his voice and by clinging to him, for he is your life and the length of your days in order for you to live on the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them.” 1 And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. 2 And he said to them, “I am a hundred and twenty years old today; I am not able to go out and to come in any longer, and Yahweh said to me, ‘You may not cross this Jordan.’ 3 Yahweh your God is about to cross before you; he will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua will be crossing before you, just as Yahweh promised. 4 And Yahweh will do to them just as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to their land, which he destroyed with them. 5 And Yahweh will deliver them to you before you, and you shall do to them according to every commandment that I have commanded you. 6 Be strong and be courageous; you should not be afraid, and you should not be in dread from their presence, for Yahweh your God is the one going with you; he will not leave you alone and he will not forsake you.” 7 Then Moses summoned Joshua, and he said to him in the presence of all Israel, “Be strong and be courageous, for you will go with this people into the land that Yahweh swore to their ancestors to give to them, and you will give it to them as an inheritance. 8 Yahweh is the one going before you; he will be with you, and he will not leave you alone, and he will not forsake you; you shall not be afraid, and you shall not be discouraged.” 9 So Moses wrote this law, and he gave it to the priests, the descendants of Levi, the ones carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and to all the elders of Israel. 10 Then Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of seven years, in the time of the year for canceling debts during the Feast of Booths, 11 when all Israel comes to appear before Yahweh their God at the place that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. 12 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little children and your aliens that are in your towns, so that they may hear and so that they may learn and they may revere Yahweh your God, and they shall diligently observe all the words of this law. 13 And then their children, who have not known, they too may hear, and they may learn to revere Yahweh their God all the days that you live on the land that you are crossing the Jordan to get there to take possession of it.” 14 Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Look, you are about to die; call Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of assembly, so that I may instruct him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of assembly. 15 And Yahweh appeared in the tent in a column of cloud, and the column of the cloud stood at the entrance of the tent. 16 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Look, you are about to lie down with your ancestors, and this people will arise and they will play the prostitute after the foreign gods of the land to which they are going. 17 And my anger shall flare up against them on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall become as prey, and disasters and troubles shall find them, and they shall say on that day, ‘Is it not because our God is not in our midst that these disasters have found us?’ 18 But I will certainly hide my face on that day, because of all of the evil that they did because they turned to other gods. 19 “And so then write this song for yourselves and teach it to the Israelites; put it in their mouth, so that this song may be for me as a witness against the Israelites. 20 For when I bring them into the land that I swore to their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey, they will eat their fill, and they will become fat, and then they will turn to other gods, and they will serve them, and they will spurn me, and they will break my covenant. 21 And then many disasters and troubles will come upon them, and this song will give evidence before them as a witness, because it will not be forgotten from out of the mouth of their descendants, for I know their inclination that they are having today before I have brought them into the land that I swore.” 22 And Moses wrote this song on that day and taught it to the Israelites. 23 Then he told Joshua the son of Nun, and said to him, “Be strong and be courageous, for you shall bring the Israelites into the land that I swore to them, and I will be with you.” ",Deuteronomy 30:12-31:23,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/deuteronomy-30123123-280136/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-05-21_deuteronomy-30123123_20120509233859.mp3
Deuteronomy,"24 And then when Moses finished writing the words of this law on the scroll until they were complete, 25 then Moses commanded the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, saying, 26 “Take the scroll of this law and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and it will be there as a witness against you. 27 For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck even now while I am still alive with you today, rebelling against Yahweh, and how much more after my death. 28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, so that I may speak in their ears these words, and that I may call as witness against them heaven and earth. 29 For I know that after my death you will certainly act corruptly, and you will turn aside from the way that I have commanded you, and the disaster in the future days will befall you, because you will do evil in the eyes of Yahweh, provoking him with the work of your hands.” 30 So Moses spoke into the ears of the assembly of Israel the words of this song until they were complete. 1 “Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak, and let the earth hear the words of my mouth. 2 May my teaching trickle like the dew, my words like rain showers on tender grass, and like spring showers on new growth. 3 For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh; ascribe greatness to our God! 4 The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are just; he is a faithful God, and without injustice; righteous and upright is he. 5 They have behaved corruptly toward him; they are not his children; this is their flaw, a generation crooked and perverse. 6 Like this do you treat Yahweh, foolish and unwise people? Has he not, your father, created you? He made you, and he established you. 7 Remember the old days, the years long past; ask your father, and he will inform you, your elders and they will tell you. 8 When the Most High apportioned the nations, at his dividing up of the sons of humankind, he fixed the boundaries of the peoples, according to the number of the children of Israel. 9 For Yahweh’s portion was his people, Jacob the share of his inheritance. 10 He found him in a desert land, and in a howling, desert wasteland; he encircled him, he cared for him, he protected him like the apple of his eye. 11 As an eagle stirs up its nest, hovers over its young, spreads out its wings, takes them, carries them on its pinions, 12 so Yahweh alone guided him, and there was no foreign god accompanying him. 13 And he set him on the high places of the land, and he fed him the crops of the field, and he nursed him with honey from crags, and with oil from flinty rock, 14 With curds from the herd, and with milk from the flock, with the fat of young rams, and rams, the offspring of Bashan, and with goats along with the finest kernels of wheat, and from the blood of grapes you drank fermented wine. 15 And Jeshurun grew fat, and he kicked; you grew fat, you bloated, and you became obstinate; and he abandoned God, his maker, and he scoffed at the rock of his salvation. 16 They made him jealous with strange gods; with detestable things they provoked him. 17 They sacrificed to the demons, not God, to gods whom they had not known, new gods who came from recent times; their ancestors had not known them. 18 The rock who bore you, you neglected, and you forgot God, the one giving you birth. 19 Then Yahweh saw, and he spurned them, because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters. 20 So he said, ‘I will hide my face from them; I will see what will be their end, for they are a generation of perversity, children in whom there is no faithfulness. 21 They annoyed me with what is not a god; they provoked me with their idols. So I will make them jealous with those not a people, with a foolish nation I will provoke them. 22 For a fire was kindled by my anger, and it burned up to the depths of Sheol, and it devoured the earth and its produce, and it set afire the foundation of the mountains. 23 I will heap disasters upon them; my arrows I will spend on them. 24 They will become weakened by famine, and consumed by plague and bitter pestilence; and the teeth of wild animals I will send against them, with the poison of the creeping things in the dust; 25 From outside her boundaries the sword will make her childless, and from inside, terror; both for the young man and also the young woman, the infant along with the gray-headed man. 26 I thought, “I will wipe them out; I will make people forget they ever existed.” 27 If I had not feared a provocation of the enemy, lest their foes might misunderstand, lest they should say, “Our hand is triumphant, and Yahweh did not do all this.” ’ 28 For they are a nation void of sense, and there is not any understanding in them. 29 If only they were wise, they would understand this; they would discern for themselves their end. 30 How could one chase a thousand and two could cause a myriad to flee, if their Rock had not sold them, and Yahweh had not given them up? 31 For the fact of the matter is, their rock is not like our Rock, and our enemies recognize this. 32 For their vine is from the vine of Sodom, and from the terraces of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of poison; their clusters are bitter. 33 Their wine is the poison of snakes, and the deadly poison of horned vipers. 34 ‘Is not this stored up with me, sealed in my treasuries?’ 35 Vengeance belongs to me and also recompense, for at the time their foot slips, because the day of their disaster is near, and fate comes quickly for them.’ 36 For Yahweh will judge on behalf of his people, and concerning his servants; he will change his mind when he sees that their power has disappeared, and there is no one left, confined or free. 37 And he will say, ‘Where are their gods, their rock in whom they took refuge? 38 Who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their libations? Let them rise up, and let them help you; Let them be to you a refuge. 39 See, now, that I, even I am he, and there is not a god besides me; I put to death and I give life; I wound and I heal; there is not one who delivers from my hand! 40 For indeed I lift up my hand to heaven, And I promise as I live forever, 41 When I sharpen my flashing sword, and my hand takes hold of it in judgment, I will take reprisals against my foes, and my haters I will repay. 42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain, and captives from the heads of the leaders of the enemy.’ 43 Call for songs of joy, O nations, concerning his people, for the blood of his servants he will avenge, and he will take reprisals against his foes, and he will make atonement for his land, his people.” 44 And Moses came, and he spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people; that is, he and Joshua the son of Nun. 45 And when Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel, 46 then he said to them, “Take to heart all the words that I am admonishing against you today concerning which you should instruct them with respect to your children so that they will observe diligently all the words of this law, 47 for it is not a trifling matter among you, but it is your life, and through this word you will live long in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan to get there to take possession of it.” 48 And Yahweh said to Moses on exactly this day, saying, 49 “Go up to this mountain of the Abarim range, Mount Nebo, which is opposite Jericho, and see the land of Canaan that I am giving to the Israelites as a possession. 50 You shall die on that mountain that you are about to go up there, and you will be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and he was gathered to his people, 51 because of the fact that you broke faith with me in the midst of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the desert of Zin, because you did not treat me as holy in the midst of the Israelites. 52 Yes, from afar you may view the land, but there you shall not enter there, that is, into the land that I am giving to the Israelites.” 1 Now this is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the Israelites before his death. 2 Then he said, “Yahweh came from Sinai, and he dawned upon them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran, and he came with myriads of holy ones, at his right hand a fiery law for them. 3 Moreover, he loves his people, all the holy ones were in your hand, and they bowed down to your feet, each one accepted directions from you. 4 A law Moses instructed for us, as a possession for the assembly of Jacob. 5 And then a king arose in Jeshurun, at the gathering of the leaders of the people, united were the tribes of Israel. 6 “May Reuben live, and may he not die, and let his number not be few.” 7 And he said this of Judah, “Hear, O Yahweh, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people; his own hands strive for him, and may you be a help against his foes.” 8 And of Levi he said, “Your Thummim and your Urim are for your faithful one, whom you tested at Massah; you contended with him at the waters of Meribah. 9 The one saying of his father and of his mother, ‘I have not regarded them,’ and his brothers he did not acknowledge, and his children he did not know, but rather they observed your word, and your covenant they kept. 10 They taught your regulations to Jacob, and your law to Israel; they placed incense smoke before you, and whole burnt offerings on your altar. 11 Bless, O Yahweh, his substance, and with the work of his hands you must be pleased; smite the loins of those who attack him, and those hating him, so that they cannot arise.” 12 Of Benjamin he said, “The beloved of Yahweh dwells securely, the Most High shields all around him, all the day, and between his shoulders he dwells.” 13 And of Joseph he said, “Blessed by Yahweh is his land, with the choice things of heaven, with dew, and with the deep lying down beneath, 14 and with the choice things of the fruits of the the sun, and with the choice things of the yield of the seasons, 15 and with the finest things of the ancient mountains, and with the choice things of the eternal hills, 16 and with the choice things of the earth and its fullness, and the favor of the one who dwelt in the bush. Let them come to the head of Joseph, and to the crown of the prince among his brothers. 17 As the firstborn of his ox, majesty belongs to him, and his horns are the horns of a wild ox; with them he drives people together, and they are the myriads of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.” 18 And of Zebulun he said, “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and rejoice, Issachar, in your tents; 19 They summon people to the mountains; there they sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness, because the affluence of the seas they suck out, and the most hidden treasures of the sand.” 20 And of Gad he said, “Blessed be the one who enlarges Gad; like a lion he dwells, and he tears an arm as well as a scalp. 21 And he selected the best part for himself, for there the portion of a ruler is included, and he came with the heads of the people; he did the righteousness of Yahweh, and his regulations for Israel.” 22 And of Dan he said, “Dan is a cub of a lion; he leaps from Bashan.” 23 And of Naphtali, he said, “Oh, Naphtali, sated of favor, and full of the blessing of Yahweh; take possession of the lake, and the land to the south.” 24 And of Asher he said, “Blessed more than sons is Asher; may he be the favorite of his brothers, dipping his feet in the oil. 25 Your bars are iron and bronze, and as your days, so is your strength.” 26 “There is no one like God, O, Jeshurun, who rides through the heavens to your help, and with his majesty through the skies. 27 The God of ancient time is a hiding place, and underneath are the arms of eternity, and he drove out from before you your enemy, and he said, ‘Destroy them!’ 28 So Israel dwells alone and carefree, the spring of Jacob in a land of grain and wine; his heavens even drip dew. 29 Blessed are you, O Israel. Who is like you, a people who is saved by Yahweh, the shield of your help, and who is the sword of your triumph, and your enemies, they shall fawn before you, and you shall tread on their backs.” 1 Then Moses went up from the desert plateau of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho, and Yahweh showed him all of the land, Gilead all the way up to Dan, 2 and all of Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh and all of the land of Judah, up to the western sea, 3 and the Negev and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palms, on up to Zoar. 4 And Yahweh said to him, “This is the land that I swore to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob, saying, ‘To your offspring I will give it.’ I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross into it.” 5 Then Moses, the servant of Yahweh, died there in the land of Moab according to the command of Yahweh. 6 And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth Peor. But until this day no one knows his burial site. 7 Now Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his sight was not impaired and his vigor had not abated. 8 And the Israelites wept concerning Moses thirty days; finally the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were completed. 9 Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom because Moses had placed his hands on him, and the Israelites listened to him, and they did as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 10 And not again has a prophet arisen in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face, 11 as far as all the signs and the wonders Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, against Pharaoh and all of his servants and against all of his land, 12 and as far as all of the mighty deeds and as far as the great awesome wonders Moses did before the eyes of all Israel.

John,"1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 This one was in the beginning with God. 3 All things came into being through him, and apart from him not one thing came into being that has come into being. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of humanity. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it. 6 A man came, sent from God, whose name was John. 7 This one came for a witness, in order that he could testify about the light, so that all would believe through him. 8 That one was not the light, but came in order that he could testify about the light. 9 The true light, who gives light to every person, was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world came into being through him, and the world did not recognize him. 11 He came to his own things, and his own people did not receive him. 12 But as many as received him—to those who believe in his name—he gave to them authority to become children of God, 13 who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a husband, but of God. 14 And the Word became flesh and took up residence among us, and we saw his glory, glory as of the one and only from the Father, full of grace and truth. 15 John testified about him and cried out, saying, “This one was he about whom I said, ‘The one who comes after me is ahead of me, because he existed before me.’ ” 16 For from his fullness we have all received, and grace after grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has seen God at any time; the one and only, God, the one who is in the bosom of the Father—that one has made him known.

John,"19 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they could ask him, “Who are you?” 20 And he confessed—and he did not deny, and confessed—“I am not the Christ!” 21 And they asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not!” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No!” 22 Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we can give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?” 23 He said, “I am ‘the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, “Make straight the way of the Lord,” ’ just as Isaiah the prophet said.” 24 (And they had been sent from the Pharisees.) 25 And they asked him and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” 26 John answered them, saying, “I baptize with water. In your midst stands one whom you do not know—27 the one who comes after me, of whom I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal!” 28 These things took place in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 29 On the next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! 30 This one is the one about whom I said, ‘After me is coming a man who is ahead of me, because he existed before me.’ 31 And I did not know him, but in order that he could be revealed to Israel, because of this I came baptizing with water.” 32 And John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and remaining upon him. 33 And I did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water, that one said to me, ‘The one upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him—this one is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ 34 And I have seen and testify that this one is the Chosen One of God. 35 On the next day again John was standing there, and two of his disciples, 36 and looking at Jesus as he was walking by, he said, “Look! The Lamb of God!” 37 And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus. 38 And Jesus, turning around and seeing them following him, said to them, “What do you seek?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means when translated “Teacher”), “where are you staying?” 39 He said to them, “Come and you will see!” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day (it was about the tenth hour). 40 Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John and followed him. 41 This one first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is translated “Christ”). 42 He brought him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, “You are Simon the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is interpreted “Peter”). 43 On the next day he wanted to depart for Galilee, and he found Philip. And Jesus said to him, “Follow me!” 44 (Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.) 45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets wrote about—Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth!” 46 And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see!” 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him, “Look! A true Israelite in whom is no deceit!” 48 Nathanael said to him, “From where do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” 49 Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the king of Israel!” 50 Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these!” ",John 1:19-50,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/john-119-50-260319/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-03-02_john-119-50_20120216164458.mp3
John,"51 And he said to him, “Truly, truly I say to all of you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.” 1 And on the third day, there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. 2 And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding. 3 And when the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine!” 4 And Jesus said to her, “What does your concern have to do with me, woman? My hour has not yet come.” 5 His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it!” 6 Now six stone water jars were set there, in accordance with the ceremonial cleansing of the Jews, each holding two or three measures. 7 Jesus said to them, “Fill the water jars with water.” And they filled them to the brim. 8 And he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the head steward. So they took it. 9 Now when the head steward tasted the water which had become wine and did not know where it was from—but the servants who had drawn the water knew—the head steward summoned the bridegroom 10 and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and whenever they are drunk, the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!” 11 This beginning of signs Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.

John,"12 After this he went down to Capernaum, and his mother and brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there a few days. 13 And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14 And he found in the temple courts those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated. 15 And he made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the temple courts, both the sheep and the oxen, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. 16 And to the ones selling the doves he said, “Take these things away from here! Do not make my Father’s house a marketplace!” 17 His disciples remembered that it is written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.” 18 So the Jews answered and said to him, “What sign do you show to us, because you are doing these things?” 19 Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up!” 20 Then the Jews said, “This temple has been under construction forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?” 21 But he was speaking about the temple of his body. 22 So when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and the saying that Jesus had spoken. 23 Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name because they saw his signs which he was doing. 24 But Jesus himself did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people, 25 and because he did not need anyone to testify about man, for he himself knew what was in man. 1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 2 This man came to him at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one is able to perform these signs that you are performing unless God were with him.” 3 Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born from above, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.” 4 Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is an old man? He is not able to enter into his mother’s womb for the second time and be born, can he?” ",John 2:12-3:4,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/john-21234-260327/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-03-06_john-21234_20120216164658.mp3
John,"5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born of water and spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God. 6 What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. 7 Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘It is necessary for you to be born from above.’ 8 The wind blows wherever it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.” 9 Nicodemus answered and said to him, “How can these things be?” 10 Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and you do not understand these things? 11 Truly, truly I say to you, we speak what we know, and we testify about what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony! 12 If I tell you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? 13 And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven—the Son of Man. 14 And just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, thus it is necessary that the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.” 16 For in this way God loved the world, so that he gave his one and only Son, in order that everyone who believes in him will not perish, but will have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world in order that he should judge the world, but in order that the world should be saved through him. 18 The one who believes in him is not judged, but the one who does not believe has already been judged, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God. 19 And this is the judgment: that the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds be exposed. 21 But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, in order that his deeds may be revealed, that they are done in God. 22 After these things Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory, and there he spent time with them and was baptizing. 23 Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and they were coming and were being baptized. 24 (For John had not yet been thrown into prison.) 25 So a dispute occurred on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew concerning purification. 26 And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, about whom you testified—look, this one is baptizing, and all are coming to him!” 27 John answered and said, “A man can receive not one thing unless it is granted to him from heaven! 28 You yourselves testify about me that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I am sent before that one.’ 29 The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. So this joy of mine is complete. 30 It is necessary for that one to increase, but for me to decrease.” 31 The one who comes from above is over all. The one who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth; the one who comes from heaven is over all. 32 What he has seen and heard, this he testifies, and no one accepts his testimony. 33 The one who accepts his testimony has attested that God is true. 34 For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God, for he does not give the Spirit by measure. 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. 36 The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life—but the wrath of God remains on him.

It was about the sixth hour. 7 A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me water to drink.” 8 (For his disciples had gone away into the town so that they could buy food.) 9 So the Samaritan woman said to him, “How do you, being a Jew, ask from me water to drink, since I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) 10 Jesus answered and said to her, “If you had known the gift of God and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me water to drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” 11 The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket and the well is deep! From where then do you get this living water? 12 You are not greater than our father Jacob, are you, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, and his sons and his livestock?” 13 Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again. 14 But whoever drinks of this water which I will give to him will never be thirsty for eternity, but the water which I will give to him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.” 15 The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or come here to draw water!” 16 He said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.” 17 The woman answered and said to him, “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her, “You have said rightly, ‘I do not have a husband,’ 18 for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you have now is not your husband; this you have said truthfully!” 19 The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet. 20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.” ",John 3:17-4:20,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/john-317420-260329/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-03-08_john-317420_20120216164704.mp3
John,"21 Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. 22 You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews. 23 But an hour is coming—and now is here—when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for indeed the Father seeks such people to be his worshipers. 24 God is spirit, and the ones who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” 25 The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (the one called Christ); “whenever that one comes, he will proclaim all things to us.” 26 Jesus said to her, “I, the one speaking to you, am he. 27 And at this point his disciples came, and they were astonished that he was speaking with a woman. However, no one said, “What do you seek?” or “Why are you speaking with her?” 28 So the woman left her water jar and went away into the town and said to the people, 29 “Come, see a man who told me everything I have ever done! Perhaps this one is the Christ?” 30 They went out from the town and were coming to him. 31 In the meanwhile the disciples were asking him, saying, “Rabbi, eat something!” 32 But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” 33 So the disciples began to say to one another, “No one brought him anything to eat, did they?” 34 Jesus said to them, “My food is that I do the will of the one who sent me and complete his work. 35 Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months and the harvest comes’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already. 36 The one who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, in order that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together. 37 For in this instance the saying is true, ‘It is one who sows and another who reaps.’ 38 I sent you to reap what you did not work for; others have worked, and you have entered into their work.” 39 Now from that town many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me everything that I have done.” 40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them. And he stayed there two days. 41 And many more believed because of his word, 42 And they were saying to the woman, “No longer because of what you said do we believe, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this one is truly the Savior of the world!” 43 And after the two days he departed from there into Galilee. 44 For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland. 45 So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, because they had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem at the feast (for they themselves had also come to the feast). 46 Now he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was at Capernaum a certain royal official whose son was sick. 47 This man, when he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, went to him and asked that he come down and heal his son, for he was about to die. 48 So Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe!” 49 The royal official said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies!” 50 Jesus said to him, “Go, your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he departed. 51 Now as he was going down, his slaves met him, saying that his child was alive. 52 So he inquired from them the hour at which he had gotten better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.” 53 So the father knew that it was that same hour at which Jesus said to him, “Your son will live,” and he himself believed, and his whole household. 54 Now this is again a second sign Jesus performed when he came from Judea into Galilee.

John,"1 After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 2 Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool called in Aramaic Bethzatha, which has five porticoes. 3 In these were lying a large number of those who were sick, blind, lame, paralyzed. 5 And a certain man was there who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness. 6 Jesus, when he saw this one lying there and knew that he had been sick a long time already, said to him, “Do you want to become well?” 7 The one who was sick answered him, “Sir, I do not have anyone that, whenever the water is stirred up, could put me into the pool. But while I am coming, another goes down before me.” 8 Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk!” 9 And immediately the man became well and picked up his mat and began to walk. (Now it was the Sabbath on that day.) 10 So the Jews were saying to the one who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not permitted for you to pick up the mat!” 11 But he answered them, “The one who made me well—that one said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk!’ ” 12 So they asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick up your mat and walk?’ ” 13 But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn while a crowd was in the place. 14 After these things Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “Look, you have become well! Sin no longer, lest something worse happen to you.” 15 The man went and reported to the Jews that Jesus was the one who made him well. 16 And on account of this the Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath. 17 But he answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I am working.” 18 So on account of this the Jews were seeking even more to kill him, because he not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God his own Father, thus making himself equal with God. 19 So Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, the Son can do nothing from himself except what he sees the Father doing. For whatever that one does, these things also the Son does likewise. 20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he himself is doing. And greater works than these he will show him, so that you will be astonished. 21 For just as the Father raises the dead and makes them alive, thus also the Son makes alive whomever he wishes. 22 For the Father does not judge anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son, 23 in order that all people will honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. 24 Truly, truly I say to you that the one who hears my word and who believes the one who sent me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.

John,"25 “Truly, truly I say to you, that an hour is coming—and now is here—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and the ones who hear will live. 26 For just as the Father has life in himself, thus also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself. 27 And he has granted him authority to carry out judgment, because he is the Son of Man. 28 “Do not be astonished at this, because an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear his voice 29 and they will come out—those who have done good things to a resurrection of life, but those who have practiced evil things to a resurrection of judgment. 30 I am able to do nothing from myself. Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the one who sent me. 31 “If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. 32 There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true. 33 You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. 34 (And I do not receive testimony from people, but I say these things in order that you may be saved.) 35 That one was the lamp which was burning and shining, and you wanted to rejoice for an hour in his light. 36 “But I have a testimony greater than John’s, for the works which the Father has given to me that I should complete them—the very works which I am doing—these testify about me, that the Father has sent me. 37 And the Father who sent me, that one has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form. 38 And you do not have his word residing in yourselves, because the one whom that one sent, in this one you do not believe. 39 You search the scriptures because you think that you have eternal life in them, and it is these that testify about me. 40 And you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life. 41 “I do not accept glory from people, 42 but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. 43 I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me. If another should come in his own name, you would accept that one! 44 How are you able to believe, if you accept glory from one another, and do not seek the glory which is from the only God? 45 Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father! The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope! 46 For if you had believed Moses, you would believe me, for that one wrote about me. 47 But if you do not believe that one’s writings, how will you believe my words?” ",John 5:25-47,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/john-525-47-263611/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-03-13_john-525-47_20120306173457.mp3
John,"1 After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee (that is, Tiberias). 2 And a large crowd was following him because they were observing the signs that he was doing on those who were sick. 3 So Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down there with his disciples. 4 (Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.) 5 Then Jesus, when he looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread so that these people can eat?” 6 (Now he said this to test him, because he knew what he was going to do.) 7 Philip replied to him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough for them, in order that each one could receive a little.” 8 One of his disciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him, 9 “Here is a boy who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many people?” 10 Jesus said, “Make the people recline.” (Now there was a lot of grass in the place.) So the men reclined, approximately five thousand in number. 11 Then Jesus took the bread, and after he had given thanks, he distributed it to those who were reclining—likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted. 12 And when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, “Gather the remaining fragments so that nothing is lost.” 13 So they gathered them, and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten. 14 Now when the people saw the sign that he performed, they began to say, “This one is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world!” 15 Then Jesus, because he knew that they were about to come and seize him in order to make him king, withdrew again up the mountain by himself alone. 16 Now when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea. 17 And getting into a boat, they began to go to the other side of the sea, to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. 18 And the sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing. 19 Then when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were afraid. 20 But he said to them, “It is I! Do not be afraid!” 21 So they were wanting to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat came to the land to which they were going.

John,"22 On the next day, the crowd that was on the other side of the sea saw that other boats were not there (except one), and that Jesus had not entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had departed alone. 23 Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 24 So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus. 25 And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” 26 Jesus replied to them and said, “Truly, truly I say to you, you seek me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied! 27 Do not work for the food that perishes, but the food that remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has set his seal on this one.” 28 So they said to him, “What shall we do that we can accomplish the works of God?” 29 Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God: that you believe in the one whom that one sent.” 30 So they said to him, “Then what sign will you perform, so that we can see it and believe you? What will you do? 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’ 32 Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, Moses did not give you bread from heaven, but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven! 33 For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” 34 So they said to him, “Sir, always give us this bread!” 35 Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never be hungry, and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty again. 36 But I said to you that you have seen me and do not believe. 37 Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never throw out, 38 because I have come down from heaven not that I should do my will, but the will of the one who sent me. 39 Now this is the will of the one who sent me: that everyone whom he has given me, I would not lose any of them, but raise them up on the last day. 40 For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks at the Son and believes in him would have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.” 41 Now the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven,” 42 and they were saying, “Is this one not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” 43 Jesus answered and said to them, “Do not grumble among yourselves! 44 No one is able to come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day. 45 It is written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who hears from the Father and learns comes to me. 46 (Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God—this one has seen the Father.) 47 Truly, truly I say to you, the one who believes has eternal life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died. 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that someone may eat from it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.” 52 So the Jews began to quarrel among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” 53 Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves! 54 The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.

John,"55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 56 The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood resides in me and I in him. 57 Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so also the one who eats me—that one will live because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. The one who eats this bread will live forever.” 59 He said these things while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. 60 Thus many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, “This saying is hard! Who can understand it?” 61 But Jesus, because he knew within himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, “Does this cause you to be offended? 62 Then what if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before? 63 The Spirit is the one who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.) 65 And he said, “Because of this I said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.” 66 For this reason many of his disciples drew back and were not walking with him any longer. 67 So Jesus said to the twelve, “You do not want to go away also, do you?” 68 Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 And we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.” 70 Jesus replied to them, “Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is the devil?” 71 (Now he was speaking about Judas son of Simon Iscariot, because this one—one of the twelve—was going to betray him.) 1 And after these things Jesus was going about in Galilee. For he did not want to go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him. 2 Now the feast of the Jews—the feast of Tabernacles—was near. 3 So his brothers said to him, “Depart from here and go to Judea, so that your disciples also can see your works that you are doing. 4 For no one does anything in secret and yet he himself desires to be publicly recognized. If you are doing these things, reveal yourself to the world!” 5 (For not even his brothers believed in him.) 6 So Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.

John,"7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I am testifying about it, that its deeds are evil. 8 You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, because my time is not yet completed. 9 And when he had said these things, he remained in Galilee. 10 But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but (as it were) in secret. 11 So the Jews were looking for him at the feast, and were saying, “Where is he?” 12 And there was a lot of grumbling concerning him among the crowds; some were saying, “He is a good man,” but others were saying, “No, but he deceives the crowd.” 13 However, no one was speaking openly about him for fear of the Jews. 14 Now when the feast was already half over, Jesus went to the temple courts and began to teach. 15 Then the Jews were astonished, saying, “How does this man possess knowledge, because he has not been taught?” 16 So Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not mine, but is from the one who sent me. 17 If anyone wants to do his will, he will know about my teaching, whether it is from God or I am speaking from myself. 18 The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory. But the one who seeks the glory of the one who sent him—this one is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him. 19 Has not Moses given you the law, and none of you carries out the law? Why do you seek to kill me?” 20 The crowd replied, “You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?” 21 Jesus answered and said to them, “I performed one work, and you are all astonished. 22 Because of this Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. 23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses would not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a whole man well on the Sabbath? 24 Do not judge according to outward appearance, but judge according to righteous judgment!” 25 Then some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say, “Is this not the one whom they are seeking to kill? 26 And behold, he is speaking openly and they are saying nothing to him! Can it be that the rulers truly know that this man is the Christ? 27 Yet we know where this man is from, but the Christ, whenever he comes—no one knows where he is from!” 28 Then Jesus cried out in the temple courts, teaching and saying, “You both know me and you know where I am from! And I have not come from myself, but the one who sent me is true, whom you do not know. 29 I know him, because I am from him and he sent me.” 30 So they were seeking to seize him, and no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. 31 But from the crowd many believed in him and were saying, “Whenever the Christ comes, he will not perform more signs than this man has done, will he?” 32 The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers in order to take him into custody . 33 Then Jesus said, “Yet a little time I am with you, and I am going to the one who sent me. 34 You will seek me and will not find me, and where I am, you cannot come.” 35 So the Jews said to one another, “Where is this one going to go, that we will not find him? He is not going to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he? 36 What is this saying that he said, ‘You will seek me and will not find me, and where I am, you cannot come’?” 37 Now on the last day of the feast—the great day—Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me, and let him drink, 38 the one who believes in me. Just as the scripture said, ‘Out of his belly will flow rivers of living water.’ ” 39 Now he said this concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were about to receive. For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.) 40 Then, when they heard these words, some from the crowd began to say, “This man is truly the Prophet!” 41 Others were saying, “This man is the Christ!” But others were saying, “No, for the Christ does not come from Galilee, does he? 42 Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?” 43 So there was a division in the crowd because of him. 44 And some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid hands on him. 45 So the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, “Why did you not bring him?” 46 The officers replied, “Never has a man spoken like this!” 47 Then the Pharisees replied to them, “You have not also been deceived, have you? 48 None of the rulers or of the Pharisees have believed in him, have they? 49 But this crowd who does not know the law is accursed!” 50 Nicodemus, the one who came to him previously—who was one of them—said to them, 51 “Our law does not condemn a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing, does it?” 52 They answered and said to him, “You are not also from Galilee, are you? Investigate and see that a prophet does not arise from Galilee!” ?53 And each one went to his own house.

John,"1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 Now early in the morning he came again to the temple courts. And all the people were coming, and he sat down and began to teach them. 3 Now the scribes and the Pharisees brought to him a woman caught in adultery. And standing her in their midst, 4 they said to him, testing him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery! 5 Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?” 6 (Now they were saying this to test him, so that they would have an occasion to bring charges against him.) But Jesus, bending down, began to write with his finger on the ground, taking no notice. 7 And when they persisted in asking him, straightening up he said to them, “The one of you without sin, let him throw the first stone at her!” 8 And bending down again, he wrote on the ground. 9 Now when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, they began to depart, one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone—and the woman who was in their midst. 10 So Jesus, straightening up and seeing no one except the woman, said to her, “Where are those accusers of yours? Does no one condemn you?” 11 And she said, “No one, Lord.” So Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go, and sin no more.”?

John,"12 Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world! The one who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” 13 So the Pharisees said to him, “You testify concerning yourself! Your testimony is not true.” 14 Jesus answered and said to them, “Even if I testify concerning myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I have come from or where I am going. 15 You judge according to externals; I do not judge anyone. 16 But even if I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me. 17 And even in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true. 18 I am the one who testifies concerning myself, and the Father who sent me testifies concerning me.” 19 So they were saying to him, “Where is your father?” Jesus replied, “You know neither me nor my Father! If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.” 20 He spoke these words by the treasury while teaching in the temple courts, and no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come. 21 So he said to them again, “I am going away, and you will seek me and will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come!” 22 Then the Jews began to say, “Perhaps he will kill himself, because he is saying, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’ ” 23 And he said to them, “You are from below; I am from above. You are from this world; I am not from this world. 24 Thus I said to you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.” 25 So they began to say to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “What I have been saying to you from the beginning. 26 I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but the one who sent me is true, and the things which I heard from him, these things I say to the world.” 27 (They did not know that he was speaking to them about the Father.) 28 Then Jesus said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will recognize that I am he, and I do nothing from myself, but just as the Father taught me, I say these things. 29 And the one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do the things that are pleasing to him.” 30 While he was saying these things, many believed in him. 31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed him, “If you continue in my word you are truly my disciples, 32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” 33 They replied to him, “We are descendants of Abraham and have not been enslaved to anyone at any time. How do you say, ‘You will become free’?” 34 Jesus replied to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. 35 And the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son remains forever. 36 So if the son sets you free, you will be truly free. 37 I know that you are descendants of Abraham. But you are seeking to kill me, because my word makes no progress among you. 38 I speak the things that I have seen with the Father; so also you do the things that you have heard from the Father.” 39 They answered and said to him, “Abraham is our father!” Jesus said to them, “If you are children of Abraham, do the deeds of Abraham! 40 But now you are seeking to kill me, a man who spoke to you the truth which I heard from God. This Abraham did not do. 41 You are doing the deeds of your father!” They said to him, “We were not born from sexual immorality! We have one father, God!” 42 Jesus said to them, “If God were your father, you would love me, for I have come forth from God and have come. For I have not come from myself, but that one sent me. 43 Why do you not understand my way of speaking? Because you are not able to listen to my message. 44 You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father! That one was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand firm in the truth, because truth is not in him. Whenever he speaks the lie, he speaks from his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of lies. 45 But because I am telling the truth, you do not believe me. 46 Who among you convicts me concerning sin? If I am telling the truth, why do you not believe me? 47 The one who is from God listens to the words of God. Because of this you do not listen—because you are not of God.” 48 The Jews answered and said to him, “Do we not correctly say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?” 49 Jesus replied, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me! 50 But I do not seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges! 51 Truly, truly I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never experience death forever.” 52 The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham and the prophets died, and you say, ‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death forever.’ 53 You are not greater than our father Abraham who died, are you? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself to be?” 54 Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. The one who glorifies me is my Father, about whom you say, ‘He is our God.’ 55 And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you! But I know him and I keep his word. 56 Abraham your father rejoiced that he would see my day, and he saw it and was glad.” 57 So the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?” 58 Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was, I am!” 59 Then they picked up stones in order to throw them at him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple courts.

John,"1 And as he went away, he saw a man blind from birth. 2 And his disciples asked him, saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?” 3 Jesus replied, “Neither this man sinned nor his parents, but it happened so that the works of God could be revealed in him. 4 It is necessary for us to do the deeds of the one who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work! 5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” 6 When he had said these things, he spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva, and smeared the clay on his eyes. 7 And he said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which is translated “sent”). So he went and washed and came back seeing. 8 Then the neighbors and those who saw him previously (because he was a beggar) began to say, “Is this man not the one who used to sit and beg?” 9 Others were saying, “It is this man”; others were saying, “No, but he is like him.” That one was saying, “I am he!” 10 So they began to say to him, “How were your eyes opened?” 11 He replied, “The man who is called Jesus made clay and smeared it on my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash!’ So I went, and I washed, and I received sight.” 12 And they said to him, “Where is that man?” He said, “I do not know.” 13 They brought him—the one formerly blind—to the Pharisees. 14 (Now the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes was the Sabbath.) 15 So the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received sight. And he said to them, “He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.” 16 So some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man is not from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath!” Others were saying, “How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?” And there was a division among them. 17 So they said to the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?” And he said, “He is a prophet.” 18 So the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received sight, until they summoned the parents of the one who received sight. 19 And they asked them, saying, “Is this man your son, whom you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?” 20 So his parents answered and said, “We know that this man is our son, and that he was born blind. 21 But how he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. Ask him! He is a mature adult; he will speak for himself!” 22 (His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already decided that if anyone should confess him to be Christ, he would be expelled from the synagogue. 23 Because of this his parents said, “He is a mature adult; ask him.”) ",John 9:1-23,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/john-91-23-263620/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-03-22_john-91-23_20120306173903.mp3
John,"24 So they summoned the man who had been blind for the second time and said to him, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner!” 25 Then that man replied, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I know—that although I was blind, now I see!” 26 So they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” 27 He replied to them, “I told you already and you did not listen! Why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become his disciples also, do you?” 28 They reviled him and said, “You are his disciple! But we are disciples of Moses! 29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from.” 30 The man answered and said to them, “For the remarkable thing is this, that you do not know where he is from, and he opened my eyes! 31 We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if someone is devout and does his will, he listens to this one. 32 From time immemorial it has not been heard that someone opened the eyes of one born blind. 33 If this man were not from God, he would not be able to do anything!” 34 They answered and said to him, “You were born completely in sin, and are you attempting to teach us?” And they threw him out. 35 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” 36 He answered and said, “And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?” 37 Jesus said to him, “You have both seen him, and he is the one who is speaking with you.” ?38 And he said, “I believe, Lord!” and he worshiped him. 39 And Jesus said,? “For judgment I have come into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind!” 40 Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and said to him, “We are not also blind, are we?” 41 Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now you say, ‘We see,’ your sin remains.

John,"1 “Truly, truly I say to you, the one who does not enter through the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up at some other place—that one is a thief and a robber. 2 But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 3 For this one the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 4 Whenever he sends out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. 5 And they will never follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.” 6 Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what it was that he was saying to them. 7 Then Jesus said to them again, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. 8 All those who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep do not listen to them. 9 I am the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will come in and will go out and will find pasture. 10 The thief comes only so that he can steal and kill and destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and have it abundantly.

John,"11 “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 12 The hired hand, who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf approaching and abandons the sheep and runs away—and the wolf seizes them and scatters them—13 because he is a hired hand and he is not concerned about the sheep. 14 “I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me, 15 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep. 16 And I have other sheep which are not from this fold. I must bring these also, and they will hear my voice, and they will become one flock—one shepherd. 17 Because of this the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take possession of it again. 18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down voluntarily. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take possession of it again. This commandment I received from my Father.” 19 Again there was a division among the Jews because of these words. 20 And many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is out of his mind! Why do you listen to him?” 21 Others were saying, “These are not the words of one who is possessed by a demon! A demon is not able to open the eyes of the blind, is it?” 22 Then the feast of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter, 23 and Jesus was walking in the temple in the Portico of Solomon. 24 So the Jews surrounded him and began to say to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly!” 25 Jesus answered them, “I told you and you do not believe! The deeds that I do in the name of my Father, these testify about me. 26 But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep! 27 My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 28 And I give them eternal life, and they will never perish forever, and no one will seize them out of my hand. 29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can seize them from the Father’s hand. 30 The Father and I are one.” 31 Then the Jews picked up stones again so that they could stone him. 32 Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?” 33 The Jews answered him, “We are not going to stone you concerning a good deed, but concerning blasphemy, and because you, although you are a man, make yourself to be God!” 34 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, “You are gods” ’? 35 If he called them ‘gods’ to whom the word of God came—and the scripture cannot be broken—36 do you say about he whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’? 37 If I do not do the deeds of my Father, do not believe me. 38 But if I am doing them, even if you do not believe me, believe the deeds, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.” 39 So they were seeking again to seize him, and he departed out of their hand. 40 And he went away again on the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John was baptizing at an earlier time, and he stayed there. 41 And many came to him and began to say, “John performed no sign, but everything John said about this man was true!” 42 And many believed in him there.

John,"1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 2 (Now it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) 3 So the sisters sent word to him, saying, “Lord, behold, the one whom you love is sick.” 4 And when he heard it, Jesus said, “This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it.” 5 (Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.) 6 So when he heard that he was sick, then he remained in the place where he was two days. 7 Then after this he said to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.” 8 The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were seeking just now to stone you, and are you going there again?” 9 Jesus replied, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks around in the daylight, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. 10 But if anyone walks around in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him. 11 He said these things, and after this he said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I can awaken him.” 12 So the disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.” 13 (Now Jesus had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was speaking about real sleep.) 14 So Jesus then said to them plainly, “Lazarus has died, 15 and I am glad for your sake that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” 16 Then Thomas (the one who is called Didymus) said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go also, so that we may die with him.” 17 So when he arrived, Jesus found he had already been four days in the tomb.

John,"17 So when he arrived, Jesus found he had already been four days in the tomb. 18 (Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia. 19 So many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary in order to console them concerning their brother.) 20 Now Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house. 21 So Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 22 Even now I know that whatever you ask God, God will grant you.” 23 Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” 24 Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” 25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live, 26 and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die forever. Do you believe this?” 27 She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who comes into the world.” 28 And when she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary privately, saying, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.” 29 So that one, when she heard it, got up quickly and went to him. 30 (Now Jesus has not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha went to meet him.) 31 So the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when they saw Mary—that she stood up quickly and went out—followed her, because they thought that she was going to the tomb in order to weep there. 32 Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” 33 Then Jesus, when he saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled within himself. 34 And he said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” 35 Jesus wept. 36 So the Jews were saying, “See how he loved him!” 37 But some of them said, “Was not this man who opened the eyes of the blind able to do something so that this man also would not have died?” 38 Then Jesus, deeply moved within himself again, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying on it. 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the one who had died, said to him, “Lord, he is stinking already, because it has been four days.” 40 Jesus said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” 41 So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes above and said, “Father, I give thanks to you that you hear me. 42 And I know that you always hear me, but for the sake of the crowd standing around I said it, so that they may believe that you sent me.” 43 And when he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” 44 The one who had died came out, his feet and his hands bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped with a facecloth. Jesus said to them, “Untie him and let him go.” 45 Then many of the Jews who had come with Mary and saw the things which he did believed in him. 46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done. 47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees called together the Sanhedrin and said, “What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs! 48 If we allow him to go on in this way, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.” 49 But a certain one of them, Caiaphas (who was high priest in that year), said to them, “You do not know anything at all! 50 Nor do you consider that it is profitable for you that one man should die for the people, and the whole nation not perish.” 51 (Now he did not say this from himself, but being high priest in that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation, 52 and not for the nation only, but also that the children of God who are scattered would be gathered into one.) 53 So from that day they resolved that they should kill him. 54 So Jesus was no longer walking openly among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples. 55 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the surrounding country before the Passover, so that they could purify themselves. 56 So they were looking for Jesus, and were speaking with one another while standing in the temple courts, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?” 57 (Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, they should report it, in order that they could arrest him.)

John,"1 Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 2 So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining at table with him. 3 Then Mary took a pound of ointment of very valuable genuine nard and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. 4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him) said, 5 “Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?” 6 (Now he said this not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, he used to steal what was put into it.) 7 So Jesus said, “Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my preparation for burial. 8 For you have the poor with you always, but you do not always have me.” 9 Now a large crowd of Jews found out that he was there, and they came, not only because of Jesus, but so that they could see Lazarus also, whom he raised from the dead. 10 So the chief priests decided that they would kill Lazarus also, 11 because on account of him many of the Jews were going and believing in Jesus. 12 On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 13 took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, and began crying out, “Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord, even the king of Israel!” 14 So Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written, 15 “Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion! Behold, your king is coming, seated on the foal of a donkey!” 16 (His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and they did these things to him.) 17 So the crowd who was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify. 18 Because of this also the crowd went to meet him, for they had heard that he had performed this sign. 19 So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are accomplishing nothing! Behold, the world has gone after him.” 20 Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up in order to worship at the feast. 21 So these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and began asking him saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” 22 Philip went and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. 23 And Jesus answered them, saying, “The hour has come that the Son of Man will be glorified. 24 Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.

John,"25 The one who loves his life loses it, and the one who hates his life in this world preserves it for eternal life. 26 If anyone serves me, he must follow me, and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him. 27 “Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, deliver me from this hour’? But for this reason I have come to this hour! 28 Father, glorify your name!” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have both glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” 29 Now the crowd that stood there and heard it said it had thundered. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him!” 30 Jesus answered and said, “This voice has not happened for my sake, but for your sake. 31 Now is the judgment of this world! Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out! 32 And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” 33 (Now he said this to indicate by what sort of death he was going to die.) 34 Then the crowd replied to him, “We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever! And how do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” 35 So Jesus said to them, “Yet a little time the light is with you! Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness does not overtake you! And the one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. 36 While you have the light, believe in the light, in order that you may become sons of light.” Jesus said these things, and then he went away and was hidden from them. 37 But as many signs as he had performed before them, they did not believe in him, 38 in order that the word of the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, “Lord, who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” 39 For this reason they were not able to believe, because again Isaiah said, 40 “He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, lest they see with their eyes and understand with their hearts and turn, and I heal them.” 41 Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory, and he spoke about him. 42 Yet despite that, even many of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue. 43 For they loved the praise of men more than praise from God. 44 But Jesus cried out and said, “The one who believes in me does not believe in me, but in the one who sent me, 45 and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me. 46 I have come as a light into the world, in order that everyone who believes in me will not remain in the darkness. 47 And if anyone hears my words and does not observe them, I will not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world. 48 The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has one who judges him; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. 49 For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father himself who sent me has commanded me what I should say and what I should speak. 50 And I know that his commandment is eternal life. So the things that I say, just as the Father said to me, thus I say.” ",John 12:25-50,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/john-1225-50-263627/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-04-02_john-1225-50_20120306174503.mp3
John,"1 Now before the feast of Passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, and having loved his own in the world, loved them to the end. 2 And as a dinner was taking place, when the devil had already put into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot that he should betray him, 3 because he knew that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he had come forth from God and was going away to God, 4 he got up from the dinner and took off his outer clothing, and taking a towel, tied it around himself. 5 Then he poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them dry with the towel which he had tied around himself. 6 Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” 7 Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand after these things.” 8 Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet forever!” Jesus replied to him, “Unless I wash you, you do not have a share with me.” 9 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!” 10 Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed only needs to wash his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not all of you.” 11 (For he knew the one who would betray him; because of this he said, “Not all of you are clean.”) 12 So when he had washed their feet and taken his outer clothing and reclined at table again, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you? 13 You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you speak correctly, for I am. 14 If then I—your Lord and Teacher—wash your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. 15 For I have given you an example, that just as I have done for you, you also do. 16 Truly, truly I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor a messenger greater than the one who sent him.

John,"17 If you understand these things, you are blessed if you do them. 18 “I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, ‘The one who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.’ 19 From now on I am telling you before it happens, in order that when it happens you may believe that I am he. 20 Truly, truly I say to you, the one who receives anyone I send receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me.” 21 When he had said these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified and said, “Truly, truly I say to you that one of you will betray me.” 22 The disciples began looking at one another, uncertain about whom he was speaking. 23 One of his disciples—the one whom Jesus loved—was reclining close beside Jesus. 24 So Simon Peter gestured for this one to inquire who it was about whom he was speaking. 25 He leaned back accordingly against Jesus’ chest and said to him, “Lord, who is it?” 26 Jesus replied, “It is he to whom I dip the piece of bread and give it to him.” Then after dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. 27 And after the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, “What you are doing, do quickly!” 28 (Now no one of those reclining at table knew for what reason he said this to him. 29 For some were thinking because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, “Purchase what we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.) 30 So after he had taken the piece of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night. 31 Then, when he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him. 32 If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will glorify him immediately. 33 Children, yet a little time I am with you. You will seek me and just as I said to the Jews, “Where I am going you cannot come,” now I say also to you. 34 “A new commandment I give to you: that you love one another—just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. 35 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples—if you have love for one another.” 36 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied, “Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.” 37 Peter said to him, “Lord, why am I not able to follow you now? I will lay down my life for you!” 38 Jesus replied, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly I say to you, the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times!

John,"1 “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. 2 In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places; but if not, I would have told you, because I am going away to prepare a place for you. 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, so that where I am, you may be also. 4 And you know the way where I am going.” 5 Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going.

John,"7 If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you know him and have seen him.” 8 Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.” 9 Jesus said to him, “Am I with you so long a time and you have not known me, Philip? The one who has seen me has seen the Father! How can you say, ‘Show us the Father?’ 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from myself, but the Father residing in me does his works. 11 Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves. 12 Truly, truly I say to you, the one who believes in me, the works that I am doing he will do also, and he will do greater works than these because I am going to the Father. 13 And whatever you ask in my name, I will do this, in order that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it. 15 “If you love me, you will keep my commandments. 16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, in order that he may be with you forever—17 the Spirit of truth, whom the world is not able to receive, because it does not see him or know him. You know him, because he resides with you and will be in you. 18 “I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you. 19 Yet a little time and the world will see me no longer, but you will see me; because I live, you also will live. 20 On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. 21 The one who has my commandments and keeps them—that one is the one who loves me. And the one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will reveal myself to him.” 22 Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, why is it that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?” 23 Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves me he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and will take up residence with him. 24 The one who does not love me does not keep my words, and the word that you hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me. 25 These things I have spoken to you while residing with you. 26 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name—that one will teach you all things, and will remind you of everything that I said to you. 27 “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you—not as the world gives, I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them be afraid. 28 You have heard that I said to you, ‘I am going away, and I am coming to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am. 29 And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe. 30 I will no longer speak much with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has no power over me. 31 But so that the world may know that I love the Father, and just as the Father has commanded me, thus I am doing.

Just as the branch is not able to bear fruit from itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me. 5 “I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me and I in him—this one bears much fruit, for apart from me you are not able to do anything. 6 If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and dries up, and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned. 7 If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you want and it will be done for you. 8 My Father is glorified by this: that you bear much fruit, and prove to be my disciples. 9 “Just as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love. 10 If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love. 11 I have spoken these things to you in order that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be made complete. 12 This is my commandment: that you love one another just as I have loved you. 13 No one has greater love than this: that someone lay down his life for his friends. 14 You are my friends if you do what I command you. 15 No longer do I call you slaves, because the slave does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything that I have heard from my Father I have revealed to you. 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and your fruit should remain, in order that whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you. 17 These things I command you: that you love one another. 18 If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you. 19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, for this reason the world hates you. 20 Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A slave is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also. 21 But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know the one who sent me. 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin. But now they do not have a valid excuse for their sin. 23 The one who hates me hates my Father also. 24 If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have sin. But now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father. 25 But this happened so that the word that is written in their law would be fulfilled, ‘They hated me without a reason.’ 26 “When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father—that one will testify about me. 27 And you also will testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.

John,"8 And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment: 9 concerning sin, because they do not believe in me, 10 and concerning righteousness, because I am going away to the Father and you will see me no more, 11 and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned. 12 I still have many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them now. 13 But when he—the Spirit of truth—comes, he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak from himself, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will proclaim to you the things to come. 14 He will glorify me, because he will take from what is mine and will proclaim it to you. 15 Everything that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he takes from what is mine and will proclaim it to you. 16 “A little while and you will see me no more, and again a little while and you will see me. 17 So some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this that he is saying to us, ‘A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me,’ and ‘Because I am going away to the Father’?” 18 So they kept on saying, “What is this that he is saying, ‘A little while’? We do not understand what he is speaking about!” 19 Jesus knew that they were wanting to ask him, and he said to them, “Are you deliberating with one another about this—that I said, ‘A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me’? 20 Truly, truly I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will become sorrowful, but your sorrow will change to joy. 21 A woman, when she gives birth, experiences pain because her hour has come. But when her child is born, she no longer remembers the affliction, on account of the joy that a human being has been born into the world. 22 So you also are experiencing sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy from you. 23 And on that day you will ask me nothing.

John,"1 When Jesus had said these things, he went out with his disciples to the other side of the ravine of the Kidron, where there was a garden into which he and his disciples entered. 2 (Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, also knew about the place, because Jesus often gathered there with his disciples.) 3 So Judas, taking the cohort and officers from the chief priests and from the Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons. 4 Then Jesus, because he knew all the things that were coming upon him, went out and said to them, “Who are you looking for?” 5 They replied to him, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He said to them, “I am he.” (Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, was also standing with them.) 6 So when he said to them, “I am he,” they drew back and fell to the ground. 7 Then he asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.” 8 Jesus replied, “I said to you that I am he! So if you are looking for me, let these men go,” 9 in order that the word that he had spoken would be fulfilled: “Those whom you have given to me—I have not lost anyone of them.” 10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. (Now the name of the slave was Malchus.) 11 So Jesus said to Peter, “Put the sword into its sheath! The cup that the Father has given me—shall I not drink it?” ",John 18:1-11,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/john-181-11-265612/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-04-17_john-181-11_20120320084502.mp3
John,"11 So Jesus said to Peter, “Put the sword into its sheath! The cup that the Father has given me—shall I not drink it?” 12 Then the cohort and the military tribune and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and tied him up, 13 and brought him to Annas first, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 14 (Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was better that one man die for the people.) 15 So Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. (Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.) 16 But Peter was standing by the door outside. So the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in. 17 Then the female slave who was the doorkeeper said to Peter, “You are not also one of the disciples of this man, are you?” He said, “I am not!” 18 (Now the slaves and the officers were standing there, having made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. And Peter was also standing there with them and warming himself.) 19 So the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. 20 Jesus replied to him, “I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple courts where all the Jews assemble, and I have said nothing in secret. 21 Why are you asking me? Ask those who heard what I have said to them! Behold, these people know what I said.” 22 Now when he had said these things, one of the officers who was standing by gave a slap in the face to Jesus, saying, “Do you reply to the high priest in this way?” 23 Jesus replied to him, “If I have spoken wrongly, testify about what is wrong! But if I have spoken correctly, why do you strike me?” 24 Then Annas sent him, tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest. 25 Now Simon Peter was standing there and warming himself. So they said to him, “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not!” 26 One of the slaves of the high priest, who was related to the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?” 27 So Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed. 28 Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s residence. Now it was early, and they did not enter into the governor’s residence so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover. 29 So Pilate came outside to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?” 30 They answered and said to him, “If this man were not doing evil, we would not have handed him over to you!” 31 So Pilate said to them, “You take him and judge him according to your law!” The Jews said to him, “It is not permitted for us to kill anyone,” 32 in order that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled that he had spoken, indicating by what sort of death he was going to die. 33 Then Pilate entered again into the governor’s residence and summoned Jesus and said to him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” 34 Jesus replied, “Do you say this from yourself, or have others said this to you about me?” 35 Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your people and the chief priests handed you over to me! What have you done?” 36 Jesus replied, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.” 37 Then Pilate said to him, “So then you are a king!” Jesus replied, “You say that I am a king. For this reason I was born, and for this reason I have come into the world: in order that I can testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.” 38 Pilate said to him, “What is truth?” And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, “I find no basis for an accusation against him. 39 But it is your custom that I release for you one prisoner at the Passover. So do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?” 40 Then they shouted again, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.)

John,"1 So then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. 2 And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and placed it on his head, and put a purple robe on him, 3 and were coming up to him and saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!” and were giving him slaps in the face. 4 And Pilate came outside again and said to them, “Behold, I am bringing him outside to you, so that you will know that I find no basis for an accusation against him.” 5 Then Jesus came outside wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, and he said to them, “Behold the man!” 6 So when they saw him, the chief priests and the officers shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify!” Pilate said to them, “You take him and crucify him! For I do not find a basis for an accusation against him.” 7 The Jews replied to him, “We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself out to be the Son of God!” 8 So when Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid, 9 and he entered into the governor’s residence again and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus did not give him an answer. 10 So Pilate said to him, “Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I have authority to crucify you?” 11 Jesus replied to him, “You would not have any authority over me unless it was given to you from above. For this reason the one who handed me over to you has greater sin.” 12 From this point on Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews shouted, saying, “If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar! Everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar!” 13 So Pilate, when he heard these words, brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat, in the place called The Stone Pavement (but Gabbatha in Aramaic). 14 (Now it was the day of preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, “Behold your king!” 15 Then those shouted, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your king?” The chief priests replied, “We do not have a king except Caesar!” 16 So then he handed him over to them in order that he could be crucified. So they took Jesus, 17 and carrying for himself the cross, he went out to the place called The Place of a Skull (which is called Golgotha in Aramaic), 18 where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the middle. 19 And Pilate also wrote a notice and placed it on the cross, and it was written: “Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews.” 20 So many of the Jews read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek. 21 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews,’ but, ‘He said, I am king of the Jews.’ ” 22 Pilate replied, “What I have written, I have written.” 23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothing and made four shares—for each soldier a share—and the tunic. (Now the tunic was seamless, woven from the top in a single piece.) 24 So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it apart, but cast lots for it, to see whose it will be,” so that the scripture would be fulfilled that says, “They divided my garments among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots.” Thus the soldiers did these things. 25 Now his mother and the sister of his mother, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene were standing near the cross of Jesus. 26 So Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, said to his mother, “Woman, behold your son!” 27 Then he said to the disciple, “Behold your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home. 28 After this, Jesus, knowing that now at last everything was completed, in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, said, “I am thirsty.” 29 A jar full of sour wine was standing there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and brought it to his mouth. 30 Then when he had received the sour wine, Jesus said, “It is completed,” and bowing his head, he gave up his spirit. 31 Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an important day), asked Pilate that their legs could be broken and they could be taken away. 32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him. 33 But when they came to Jesus, after they saw he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 34 But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water came out immediately. 35 And the one who has seen it has testified, and his testimony is true, and that person knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe. 36 For these things happened in order that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not a bone of his will be broken.” 37 And again another scripture says, “They will look on the one whom they have pierced.” ",John 19:1-37,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/john-191-37-265614/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-04-19_john-191-37_20120320084704.mp3
John,"38 And after these things, Joseph who was from Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (but a secret one for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate allowed it, so he came and took away his body. 39 And Nicodemus—the one who had come to him formerly at night—also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds. 40 So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in strips of linen cloth with the fragrant spices, as is the Jews’ custom to prepare for burial. 41 Now there was a garden at the place where he was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one was yet buried. 42 So there, on account of the day of preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was close by, they buried Jesus. 1 Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw the stone had been taken away from the tomb. 2 So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord from the tomb and we do not know where they have put him!” 3 Then Peter and the other disciple went out and were going to the tomb. 4 And the two were running together, and the other disciple ran ahead, faster than Peter, and came to the tomb first. 5 And bending over to look, he saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, though he did not go in. 6 Then Simon Peter also came following him, and he went into the tomb and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, 7 and the facecloth that was on his head—not lying with the strips of linen cloth, but folded up separately in one place. 8 So then the other disciple who had come to the tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed. 9 (For they did not yet know the scripture that it was necessary for him to rise from the dead.) 10 Then the disciples went away again to their own homes. 11 But Mary stood outside at the tomb, weeping. Then, while she was weeping, she bent over to look into the tomb, 12 and she saw two angels in white, seated one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been lying. 13 And they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him!” 14 When she had said these things, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and she did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” She thought that it was the gardener, and said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him.” 16 Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned around and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni” (which means “Teacher”). 17 Jesus said to her, “Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.’ ” 18 Mary Magdalene came and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and he had said these things to her. ",John 19:38-20:18,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/john-1938-2018-265616/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-04-20_john-1938-2018_20120320084705.mp3
John,"19 Now when it was evening on that day—the first day of the week—and the doors had been shut where the disciples were because of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them, “Peace to you.” 20 And when he had said this, he showed his hands and his side to them. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. 21 So Jesus said to them again, “Peace to you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.” 22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. 23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them. If you retain the sins of any, they are retained.” 24 Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 So the other disciples said to him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe!” 26 And after eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Although the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said, “Peace to you.” 27 Then he said to Thomas, “Place your finger here and see my hands, and place your hand and put it into my side. And do not be unbelieving, but believing!” 28 Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God!” 29 Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen me, have you believed? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.” 30 Now Jesus also performed many other signs in the presence of the disciples which are not recorded in this book, 31 but these things are recorded in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

John,"1 After these things Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. Now he revealed himself in this way: 2 Simon Peter and Thomas (who was called Didymus) and Nathanael from Cana in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciples were together. 3 Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing!” They said to him, “We also are coming with you.” They went out and got into the boat, and during that night they caught nothing. 4 Now when it was already early morning, Jesus stood on the beach. However, the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 So Jesus said to them, “Children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you? They answered him, “No.” 6 And he said to them, “Throw the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they threw it, and were no longer able to haul it in from the large number of the fish. 7 Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” So Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, tied around himself his outer garment (for he was naked) and threw himself into the sea. 8 But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net of fish, because they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away. 9 So when they got out on the land, they saw a charcoal fire laid there, and a fish lying on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught.” 11 So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net to the land, full of large fish—one hundred fifty-three—and although there were so many, the net was not torn. 12 Jesus said to them, “Come, eat breakfast!” But none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they knew that it was the Lord. 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise. 14 This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he had been raised from the dead. 15 Now when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs!” 16 He said to him again a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Shepherd my sheep!” 17 He said to him a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter was distressed because he said to him a third time, “Do you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything! You know that I love you!” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep! 18 Truly, truly I say to you, when you were young, you tied your clothes around yourself and walked wherever you wanted. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will tie you up and carry you where you do not want to go. 19 (Now he said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God.) And after he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me!” 20 Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them (who also leaned back on his chest at the dinner and said, “Lord, who is the one betraying you?”) 21 So when he saw this one, Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, but what about this one?” 22 Jesus said to him, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!” 23 So this saying went out to the brothers that that disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?” 24 This is the disciple who is testifying about these things, and who has written down these things. And we know that his testimony is true. 25 Now there are also many other things that Jesus did, which—if they were written down one after the other—I suppose not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written.

Numbers,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, in the tent of assembly, on the first of the month, in the second year after they came out of the land of Egypt, saying, 2 “Take a census of the entire community of the Israelites according to their clans and their families, according to the number of names, every male individually 3 from twenty years old and above, everyone in Israel who is able to go to war. You and Aaron must muster them for their wars. 4 A man from each tribe will be with you, each man the head of his family. 5 And these are the names of the men who will assist you: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur; 6 from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai; 7 from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab; 8 from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar; 9 from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon. 10 From the descendants of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur. 11 From Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni; 12 from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai; 13 from Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran; 14 from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel; 15 and from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.” 16 These are the ones summoned from the community, the leaders of their ancestors’ tribes; they are the heads of Israel’s clans. 17 So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name, ",Numbers 1:1-17,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/numbers-11-17-256064/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-02-02_numbers-11-17_20120125134503.mp3
Numbers,"18 and they summoned the entire community on the first day of the second month. And they registered themselves among their clans according to their families, according to the number of names from those twenty years old and above individually, 19 just as Yahweh commanded Moses. And he counted them in the desert of Sinai. 20 The descendants of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, according to the number of names, every male individually from twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war: 21 those who were counted from the tribe of Reuben were forty-six thousand five hundred. 22 From the descendants of Simeon, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, those who were counted according to the number of their names, every individual male from twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war: 23 those who were counted from the tribe of Simeon were fifty-nine thousand three hundred. 24 From the descendants of Gad, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, according to the number of names, from those twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war: 25 those who were counted from the tribe of Gad were forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty. 26 From the descendants of Judah, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, according to the number of names, from those twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war: 27 those who were counted from the tribe of Judah were seventy-four thousand six hundred. 28 From the descendants of Issachar, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, according to the number of names, from those twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war: 29 those who were counted from the tribe of Issachar were fifty-four thousand four hundred. 30 From the descendants of Zebulun, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, according to the number of names, from those twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war: 31 those who were counted from the tribe of Zebulun were fifty-seven thousand four hundred. 32 From the descendants of Joseph: from the descendants of Ephraim, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, according to the number of names, from those twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war: 33 those who were counted from the tribe of Ephraim were forty thousand five hundred. 34 From the descendants of Manasseh, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, according to the number of names, from those twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war: 35 those who were counted from the tribe of Manasseh were thirty-two thousand two hundred. 36 From the descendants of Benjamin, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, according to the number of names, from those twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war: 37 those who were counted from the tribe of Benjamin were thirty-five thousand four hundred. 38 From the descendants of Dan, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, according to the number of names, from those twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war: 39 those who were counted from the tribe of Dan were sixty-two thousand seven hundred. 40 From the descendants of Asher, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, according to the number of names, from those twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war: 41 those who were counted from the tribe of Asher were forty-one thousand five hundred. 42 From the descendants of Naphtali, their genealogies according to their clans, according to their families, according to the number of names, from those twenty years old and above, everyone who is able to go to war: 43 those who were counted from the tribe of Naphtali were fifty-three thousand four hundred. 44 These are the ones counted whom Moses and Aaron mustered, with the twelve leaders of Israel, each one from his family. 45 So all those who were counted from the Israelites according to their families, from those twenty years old and above, everyone in Israel who is able to go to war. 46 All of the ones counted were six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty. 47 The Levites from their ancestors’ tribe were not mustered in their midst. 48 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 49 “You will not muster the tribe of Levi, and you will not take a census of them in the midst of the Israelites. 50 You will appoint them over the tabernacle of the testimony, over all its vessels, and over all that belongs to it. They will carry the tabernacle and all its vessels, and they will care for it; and they will camp around the tabernacle. 51 And when the tabernacle is set out, the Levites will take it down, and when encamping the tabernacle the Levites will set it up; the stranger that approaches it will be put to death. 52 The Israelites will encamp, each in their own camp, and each by their own banner according to their divisions. 53 But the Levites will encamp around the tabernacle of the testimony, and there will not be wrath on the community of the Israelites; and the Levites will keep the requirements of the tabernacle of the testimony.” 54 And the Israelites did thus; they did everything that Yahweh commanded Moses. 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 2 “The Israelites will encamp each with his standard, with a banner according to their families; they will encamp around the tent of assembly. 3 The ones who encamp on the eastern side, toward the sunrise, will be of the standard of the camp of Judah according to their divisions; and the leader of the descendants of Judah will be Nahshon son of Amminadab, 4 and his division and the ones counted are seventy-four thousand six hundred. 5 And the ones who encamp next to him will be the tribe of Issachar.

They will set out second according to their divisions. 17 “The tent of assembly the camp of the Levites will set out in the midst of the camps; they will set out just as they encamped, each according to their standards. 18 “The standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their divisions will be to the west. The leader of the descendants of Ephraim will be Elishama son of Ammihud. 19 And his division and the ones counted are forty thousand five hundred. 20 The tribe of Manasseh will be next to him. The leader of the descendants of the tribe of Manasseh will be Camaliel son of Pedahzur. 21 And his division and the ones counted are thirty-two thousand two hundred. 22 For the tribe of Benjamin: the leader of the descendants of Benjamin will be Abidan son of Gideoni. 23 And his division and the ones counted are thirty-five thousand four hundred. 24 All those counted from the camp of Ephraim are one hundred and eighty thousand one hundred. They will set out third according to their divisions. 25 “The standard of the camp of Dan according to their divisions will be to the west. The leader of the descendants of Dan will be Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai. 26 And his division and the ones counted are sixty-two thousand seven hundred. 27 Those encamped next to him will be the tribe of Asher.

Numbers,"1 These are the genealogies of Aaron and Moses at the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai. 2 These are the names of the descendants of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 3 These are the names of the descendants of Aaron, the priests, the anointed ones whom he consecrated as priests. 4 Nadab and Abihu died before Yahweh when they presented a strange fire before Yahweh in the desert of Sinai, and they had no children. Eleazar and Ithamar served as priest during the presence of Aaron their father. 5 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 6 “Bring near the tribe of Levi, and set the tribe before Aaron the priest, and they will minister to him. 7 They shall observe his duties and the duties of the entire community before the tent of assembly, to do the work of the tabernacle. 8 And they will keep all the vessels of the tent of assembly and the responsibilities of the Israelites, to do the work of the tabernacle. 9 You will give the Levites to Aaron and to his descendants; they are surely assigned to him from among the Israelites. 10 But you will count Aaron and his descendants; they will keep their priesthood, and the stranger who approaches will be put to death.” 11 Yahweh spoke to Moses saying, 12 “I myself receive the Levites from the midst of the Israelites in the place of all the firstborn of the offspring of the womb from the Israelites. The Levites will be mine 13 because all the firstborn are mine; on the day of my killing all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated for myself all the firstborn in Israel, both humankind and animal; they will be mine. I am Yahweh.” 14 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, saying, 15 “Muster the descendants of Levi according to their families, according to their clans. You will count every male from one month and above.” 16 So Moses mustered them according to the command of Yahweh, just as he commanded. 17 These were the sons of Levi according to their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 18 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon according to their clans: Libni and Shimei. 19 And the sons of Kohath according to their clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 20 The sons of Merari according to their tribes: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites according to their families. 21 To Gershon belonged the clan of the Libnites and the clan of the Shimeites; these are the clans of the Gershonites. 22 The ones counted according to the number of every male from one month and above were seven thousand five hundred. 23 The clans of the Gershonites will camp behind the tabernacle to the west, 24 and the leader of the family of the Gershonites is Eliasaph son of Lael. 25 And the responsibility of the descendants of Gershon in the tent of assembly is the tabernacle, and the tent covering it and the curtain of the doorway of the tent of the assembly, 26 and the hangings of the courtyard and the curtain of the doorway of the courtyard that is around the tabernacle and the altar, and its ten cords, all of its use. 27 To Kohath belonged the clan of Amramites, the clan of the Izharites, the clan of the Hebronites, and the clan of the Uzzielites; these were the clans of the Kohathites. 28 According to the number of every male from one month and above there were eight thousand six hundred keeping the responsibility of the sanctuary. 29 The clan of the descendants of Kohath will encamp on the side of the tabernacle to the south. 30 The leader of his family according to the clans of the Kohathites is Elizaphan the son of Uzziel. 31 Their responsibility was the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altar, and the vessels of the sanctuary, with which they ministered, and the curtain, and all of its use. 32 The chief of the leaders of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest who had oversight of those keeping the responsibility of the sanctuary. 33 To Merari belonged the clan of Mahlites and the clan of the Mushites: these are the clans of Merari. 34 The ones counted according to the number of every male from one month and above were six thousand two hundred. 35 The leader of the family according to the clans of Merari is Zuriel son of Abihail; they will encamp of the side of the tabernacle to the north. 36 The responsibility of the sons of Merari was the supervision of the frames of the tabernacle, its bars, pillars, bases, and all its vessels and all its service, 37 and the pillars around the courtyard, and their bases, pegs, and cords. 38 Those encamped before the tabernacle to the east—before the tent of assembly to the east—were Moses and Aaron and his sons; they will keep the responsibility of the sanctuary for the Israelites; and the stranger who approaches will be put to death. 39 All those counted from the Levites whom Moses and Aaron mustered according to the word of Yahweh, according to their clans, every male from one month and above were twenty-two thousand. 40 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Muster every firstborn male from the Israelites from one month and above and count their names. 41 And you will receive the Levites for me—I am Yahweh—in the place of all the firstborn among the Israelites, and the animals of the Levites in the place of all the firstborn among the animals among the Israelites.” 42 So Moses mustered all the firstborn among the Israelites just as Yahweh commanded him. 43 And all the firstborn males among the number of names from one month and above, the ones counted, were twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three. 44 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 45 “Receive the Levites in the place of all the firstborn among the Israelites, and the animals of the Levites in the place of their animals; the Levites will be mine. I am Yahweh. 46 And the ransom of the two hundred and seventy-three of the firstborn of the Israelites who are excessive over the Levites, 47 you will receive five shekels a person, in the sanctuary shekel; you will collect twenty gerahs per shekel. 48 You will give the money to Aaron, and to his sons the ransom of the ones who are excessive among them.” 49 And Moses received the money of the redemption from the ones who were excessive from those redeemed of the Levites. 50 From the firstborn of the Israelites he took the money, one thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, in the sanctuary shekel. 51 And Moses gave the money of the ransom to Aaron and to his sons according to the word of Yahweh just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 2 “Take a census of the descendants of Kohath from the midst of the descendants of Levi, according to their clans and their families, 3 from thirty years old and above, up to fifty years old, everyone who comes to the service to do the work in the tent of assembly. 4 This is the work of the descendants of Kohath in the tent of assembly, concerning the holiness of the sanctuary: 5 When setting out the camp, Aaron and his sons will go and lower the curtain of the covering and cover with it the ark of the testimony. 6 They will put on it a covering of fine leather, and they will spread a cloth of perfect blue over it, and they will place its poles. 7 And over the table of the presence they will spread out a blue cloth and put on it the plates, dishes, and libation bowls, and the pitchers of the libation; and the bread of continuity will be on it. 8 They will spread over it a scarlet cloth, and they will cover it with a covering of fine leather, and they will place its poles. 9 They will take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand for the light source, its lamps, a pair of its tongs, its small pans, and all the vessels of its oil with which they attend to it. 10 They will put it and all its vessels inside a covering of fine leather and put it on the carrying frame. 11 Over the altar of gold they will spread a blue cloth, and they will cover it with a covering of fine leather and place its poles. 12 They will take all the vessels of the cultic service with which they serve in the sanctuary and put them on a blue cloth, and they will cover them with a covering of fine leather; and they will put them on the carrying frame. 13 They will remove the fat-soaked ashes from the altar and spread a purple cloth over it; 14 they will put on it all the vessels with which they serve, the fire pans, forks, shovels, and bowls—all the vessels of the altar. They will spread on it a covering of fine leather; and they will place its poles. 15 And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the vessels of the sanctuary when the camp sets out, the descendants of Kohath will come after to carry these, but they must not touch the sanctuary, or they will die. These are the load of the descendants of Kohath in the tent of assembly. 16 “Eleazar son of Aaron the priest is to supervise the oil of the light source, the incense, the regular grain offering, the oil of anointment, the supervision of all the tabernacle and all that is in it, in the sanctuary and in its vessels.” 17 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 18 “You must not cut off the tribe of the clan of the Kohathites from the midst of the Levites. 19 Do this to them and they will live and not die when they come near the most holy things. Aaron and his sons will go and appoint them, each one to his task and burden. 20 But they must not go and look for a moment at the holy objects.” 21 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 22 “Take a census of the descendants of Gershon also, according to their families and clans, 23 from those twenty years old and above until fifty years old; you will muster them, all who come to help to do the work of the tent of assembly. 24 This is the work of the clans of the Gershonites: to serve and to carry. 25 They will carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the tent of assembly and its covering and the covering of fine leather, which is on top of it, and the curtain of the doorway of the tent of assembly, 26 and the curtains of the courtyard, and the covering for the doorway of the gate of the courtyard, which is all around on the tabernacle and altar, and their cords and all the vessels of their work; and all that is done to them they will do. 27 And all the work of the descendants of the Gershonites will be at the command of Aaron and his sons, for all they are to carry and for all their work, and you will appoint to them responsibility for all they are to carry. 28 This is the work of the clan of the descendants of the Gershonites in the tent of assembly, and their responsibility lies under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. 29 “For the descendants of Merari according to their clans, according to their families, you will muster them; 30 from those thirty years old and above until fifty years old; you will muster them, all who come to do the work of the tent of assembly. 31 And this is the responsibility of those who are to carry, all their work in the tent of assembly: the frames of the tabernacle and its bars, pillars, and bases, 32 and the pillars of the courtyard all around, and their bases, pegs, and cords, with all their vessels and for all their work. You will appoint by name the vessels that they are responsible to carry. 33 This is the work of the clan of the descendants of Merari, for all their work in the tent of assembly under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.” 34 And Moses and Aaron mustered the leaders of the community according to the house of their families, 35 from those thirty years old and above until fifty years old; everyone who comes to the service to work in the tent of assembly, 36 the ones counted were two thousand seven hundred and fifty. 37 These were those counted of the clans of the Kohathites, everyone who served in the tent of assembly whom Moses and Aaron mustered according to the command of Yahweh by the hand of Moses. 38 And the descendants of Gershon counted according to their clans and according to their families, 39 from those thirty years old and above until fifty years old, everyone who comes to the service to work in the tent of assembly; 40 the ones counted, according to their clans, according to their families, were two thousand six hundred and thirty. 41 These were those counted of the clans of the descendants of Gershon, everyone who serves in the tent of assembly whom Moses and Aaron mustered according to the command of Yahweh. 42 Those counted of the clans of the descendants of Merari according to their clans, according to their families, 43 from those thirty years old and above until fifty years old, everyone who comes to the service to work in the tent of assembly, 44 the ones counted, according to their clans, were three thousand two hundred. 45 These were those counted of the clans of the descendants of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron mustered according to the command of Yahweh by the hand of Moses. 46 All those counted of the Levites whom Moses and Aaron and all the leaders of Israel mustered according to their clans, according to their families, 47 from those thirty years old and above until fifty years old, everyone who comes to the service to do the work of the service carrying in the tent of assembly, 48 the ones counted were eighty thousand five hundred and eighty. 49 According to the command of Yahweh by the hand of Moses they were mustered, each man according to his service and according to their service and according to their burden; and so they were counted by him just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

Numbers,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Command the Israelites: they must send everyone from the camp who is afflicted with a rash, everyone with a fluid discharge, and everyone unclean through contact with a corpse. 3 You will send away both male and female; you will send them outside the camp. They must not make unclean their camps where I am dwelling in their midst.” 4 So the Israelites did so. They sent them away outside the camp; just as Yahweh spoke to Moses, so did the Israelites. 5 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 6 “Speak to the Israelites: ‘When a man or woman commits any of the sins of humankind by acting unfaithfully, it is a sin against Yahweh, and that person will be guilty; 7 they will confess their sin that they did and will make restitution for their guilt by adding a fifth to it and giving it to whomever was wronged. 8 But if the man does not have a redeemer to make restitution to him for the reparation, the reparation is to be given to Yahweh for the priest, in addition to the ram of atonement by which atonement is made for him. 9 And every contribution of all the holy objects of the Israelites that they bring to the priest for him will be his. 10 The holy objects of a man will be for him; whatever he gives to the priest will be for him.’ ” 11 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 12 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘If any man’s wife goes astray and acts unfaithfully to him, 13 and a man sleeps with her and ejaculates and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and she is concealed, although she is defiled, and there is no witness against her and she was not caught, 14 if a spirit of jealousy comes over him, and he is jealous of his wife and she is defiled; or if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife but she is not defiled, 15 he will bring his wife to the priest. And he will bring her offering for her, one-tenth of an ephah of flour. He will not pour oil on it, and he will not put frankincense on it because it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of remembering, a reminding of guilt. 16 “ ‘Then the priest will bring her near and present her before Yahweh; 17 the priest will take holy waters in a clay vessel, and from the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle, and the priest will put it into the waters. 18 And the priest will present the woman before Yahweh, and he will uncover the head of the woman; he will then put in her hands the grain offering of the remembering—which is the grain offering of jealousy—and in the hand of the priest will be the waters of bitterness that brings a curse. 19 Then the priest will make her swear an oath, and he will say to the woman, “If a man has not slept with you, and if you have not had an impurity affair under your husband, go unpunished from the waters of bitterness that brings this curse. 20 But if you have had an affair under your husband, and if you are defiled and a man other than your husband had intercourse with you,” 21 the priest will make the woman swear an oath of the sworn oath of the curse, the priest will say to the woman, “May Yahweh give you a curse and a sworn oath in the midst of your people with Yahweh making your hip fall away and your stomach swollen; 22 and these waters that bring a curse will go into your intestines to cause your womb to swell and to make your hip fall away.” And the women will say, “Amen. Amen.” 23 “ ‘And the priests will write these curses on the scroll, and he will wipe them off into the waters of the bitterness. 24 He will make the woman drink the waters of the bitterness that brings a curse, and the waters of bitterness that bring a curse will go into her. 25 The priest will take the grain offering of jealousy from the hand of the woman, and he will wave the grain offering before Yahweh, and he will present it to the altar; 26 the priest will grasp her memorial offering from the grain offering, and he will turn it into smoke on the altar, and afterward he will make the woman drink the waters. 27 When he has made her drink the waters, it will come about, if she has defiled herself and acted unfaithfully to her husband and the waters of bitterness that bring a curse go into her and her stomach swells and her hip falls away, the woman will be as a curse in the midst of her people. 28 And if the woman is not defiled, and she is pure, she will go unpunished and be able to conceive children. 29 “ ‘This is the regulation of jealousy, when a woman has an affair under her husband and she is defiled, 30 or when a spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife, he will present the woman before Yahweh,and the priest will do to her all of this law. 31 The man will go unpunished from guilt, and the woman, she will bear her guilt.’ ” 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘When a man or a woman takes a special vow, a vow of a Nazirite, to keep separate for Yahweh, 3 he will abstain from wine and fermented drink; he will not drink wine vinegar or vinegar of fermented drink; he will not drink the fruit juice of grapes or eat fresh or dry grapes. 4 All the days of his separation you will not eat from anything that is made from the grapevine, from sour grapes to the skin of grapes. 5 “ ‘All the days of the vow of his separation a razor will not pass over his head. Until fulfilling the days that he separated himself to Yahweh he will be holy and grow long the locks of the hair of his head. 6 “ ‘All the days of keeping himself separated for Yahweh he will not go to a person who is dead; 7 for even his father, mother, brother, or sister he will not make himself unclean by their death, because the separation to his God is on his head.

Numbers,"8 He will be holy for Yahweh all the days of his separation. 9 “ ‘If someone dies suddenly and makes the head of his separation unclean, he will shave off the hair of his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he will shave it off. 10 On the eighth day he will bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest by the doorway of the tent of assembly, 11 and the priest will offer one for a sin offering and one for a burnt offering, and he will make atonement for him because he sinned concerning the corpse. He will consecrate his head on that day. 12 He will rededicate to Yahweh the days of his separation and bring a ram-lamb in its first year as a guilt offering. The former days of his vow will fall away because his separation was defiled. 13 “ ‘This is the regulation of the Nazirite for the day of the fulfilling of the days of his separation: one will bring him to the doorway of the tent of the assembly. 14 He will present his offering to Yahweh, one ram-lamb in its first year without defect as a burnt offering, and one ewe-lamb in its first year without defect as a sin offering, and one ram without defect as a fellowship offering; 15 and a basket of unleavened bread, finely milled flour of ring-shaped bread cakes mixed with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread smeared with oil, and their grain offering and their libations. 16 The priest will present before Yahweh and offer his sin offering, his burnt offering; 17 he will offer a ram as a sacrifice of a fellowship offering to Yahweh, in addition to the basket of the unleavened bread; the priest will offer his grain offering and his libation. 18 The Nazirite will shave off the hair of his consecrated head at the doorway of the tent of assembly, and he will take the hair of his consecrated head, and he will put it on the fire that is beneath the sacrifice of the fellowship offering. 19 The priest will take the shoulder from the ram that is boiled, and one ring-shaped bread cake of unleavened bread from the basket, and one wafer of unleavened bread, and he will put them on the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his consecrated head. 20 The priest will wave them as a wave offering before the presence of Yahweh; they are a holy object to the priest, in addition to the breast section of the wave offering, and in addition to the upper thigh of the contribution; and afterward the Nazirite may drink wine. 21 “ ‘This is the regulation of the Nazirite who has made a vow of his offering to Yahweh according to his separation, in addition to what he can afford. In accordance to the word of his vow that he vowed, he will do, concerning the instruction of his separation.’ ” 22 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 23 “Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘You will bless the Israelites: You will say to them: 24 Yahweh will bless you and keep you; 25 Yahweh will make shine his face on you and be gracious to you; 26 Yahweh will lift up his face upon you, and he will give you peace.’ 27 And they will put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.” 1 On the day Moses finished setting up the tabernacle and appointed and consecrated it and all its vessels, and the altar and its vessels, and he appointed them and consecrated them, 2 the leaders of Israel, the heads of the families, presented an offering; they were the leaders of the tribes and were the ones in charge of the counting. 3 They brought their offering before the presence of Yahweh, six covered utility carts and twelve cattle, a utility cart for two of the leaders, and a bull for each; and they presented them before the tabernacle. 4 Yahweh said to Moses, saying, 5 “Take them, and they will be used to do the work of the tent of the assembly; and you will give them to the Levites, each according to his required service.” 6 So Moses took the utility carts and the cattle, and he gave them to the Levites. 7 Two utility carts and four cattle he gave to the descendants of Gershon according to their required service; 8 and four utility carts and eight cattle he gave to the descendants of Merari according to their required service, under the authority of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. 9 But to the descendants of Kohath he did not give anything because the work of the sanctuary they carried upon them on their shoulders. 10 The leaders presented offerings for the dedication of the altar on the day of its anointing, and the leaders presented their offerings before the altar. 11 Yahweh said to Moses, “One leader for each day will present their offering for the dedication of the altar.” 12 And it happened, the one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahshon son of Amminadab from the tribe of Judah. 13 His offering was one plate of silver—its weight was one hundred and thirty shekels—and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels according to the sanctuary shekel, both of them filled with finely milled flour mixed with oil as a grain offering; 14 one golden dish weighing ten shekels filled with incense; 15 one young bull, one ram, one male lamb in its first year as a burnt offering; 16 one he-goat as a sin offering; 17 and as a sacrifice of the fellowship offering, two cattle, five rams, five he-goats, and five male lambs a year old.

These were the dedication of the altar after its anointing. 89 And when Moses came to the tent of assembly to speak with him, he would hear the voice speaking to him from the atonement cover, which is on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim, and he would speak to him.

Numbers,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Speak to Aaron, and say to him: ‘When you are setting up the lamps, the seven lamps will give light in front of the face of the lampstand.’ ” 3 And Aaron did so; he set up the lampstand in front of the face of its lamps, just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 4 And this is how the lampstand was made, a hammered-work of gold; from its base up to its blossom, it was hammered-work according to the pattern that Yahweh showed Moses; so he made the lampstand. 5 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 6 “Take the Levites from the midst of the Israelites and purify them. 7 So you will do to them, to purify them: sprinkle on them waters of purification, and they will shave their whole body and wash their garments. 8 And they will take a young bull and its grain offering of finely milled flour mixed with oil, and you will take a second young bull as a sin offering. 9 You will bring the Levites before the tent of assembly, and you will summon the entire community of the Israelites. 10 And you will bring the Levites before Yahweh, and the Israelites will lay their hands on the Levites, 11 and Aaron will offer the Levites as a wave offering before Yahweh from the Israelites, and they will do the work of Yahweh. 12 And the Levites will lay their hands on the head of the one bull and offer it as a sin offering and the other one as a burnt offering to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites. 13 And you will present the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and he will offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh. 14 “And you will separate the Levites from the midst of the Israelites, and the Levites will be for me. 15 And after this the Levites will come to serve at the tent of assembly, and you will purify them, and you will offer them as a wave offering. 16 For they are given to me exclusively from the midst of the Israelites. I have taken them for myself in place of the firstborn of every womb, every firstborn from the Israelites. 17 For every firstborn among the Israelites is mine, both humankind and animal. On the day I destroyed every firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them to me, 18 and I have taken the Levites in the place of every firstborn among the Israelites. 19 And I have given the Levites; they are given to Aaron and his sons from the midst of the Israelites to do the work of the Israelites in the tent of the assembly and to make atonement for the Israelites, so a plague will not be among the Israelites when the Israelites come near the sanctuary.” 20 And Moses and Aaron and the entire community of the Israelites did to the Levites; everything that Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites, the Israelites did to them. 21 And the Levites purified themselves, and they washed their garments, and Aaron offered them as a wave offering before Yahweh; and Aaron made atonement for them to purify them. 22 After this the Levites came to do their work in the tent of assembly before Aaron and his sons. Just as Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levities, so they did to them. 23 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 24 “This is what is for the Levites: those twenty-five years old and above will come to help with the service in the work of the tent of assembly; 25 and those fifty years old will return from the service of the work and will serve no longer. 26 They can attend their brothers in the tent of assembly to keep their responsibilities, but they will not do work. This is what you will do concerning the Levities and their responsibilities.” 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, in the second year after they came out from the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying, 2 “Let the Israelites observe the Passover at its appointed time. 3 On the fourteenth day of this month at twilight you will perform it at its appointed time according to all its decrees; and according to all its stipulations you will observe it.” 4 So Moses spoke to the Israelites to observe the Passover. 5 And they observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight in the desert of Sinai. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, thus the Israelites did. 6 And it happened, men who were unclean by a dead person were not able to perform the Passover on that day. And they came before Moses and Aaron on that day. 7 And those men said to him, “Although we are unclean by a dead person, why are we hindered from presenting the offering of Yahweh at its appointed time in the midst of the Israelites?” 8 Moses said to them, “Stay. I will hear what Yahweh commands to you.” 9 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 10 “Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘Each man that is unclean by a dead person or is on a far journey, you or your descendants, he will observe the Passover of Yahweh. 11 On the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they will observe it; they will eat it with unleavened bread and bitter plants. 12 They will leave none of it until morning, and they will not break a bone in it; they will observe it according to every decree of the Passover. 13 But the man who is clean and not on a journey, and he fails to observe the Passover, that person will be cut off from the people because he did not present the offering of Yahweh on its appointed time. That man will bear his guilt. 14 If an alien dwells with you he will observe the Passover of Yahweh according to the decree of the Passover and according to its stipulation; thus you will have one decree for you, for the alien and for the native of the land.’ ” 15 And on a day setting up the tabernacle, the cloud covered the tent of the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony; in the evening it was on the tabernacle as an appearance of fire until morning. 16 So it was continually; the cloud would cover it and the appearance of fire by night. 17 Whenever the cloud lifted up from on the tent, after that the Israelites would set out, and in the place where the cloud dwelled, there the Israelites camped. 18 On the command of Yahweh the Israelites would set out, and on the command of Yahweh they encamped; all the days that the cloud dwelled on the tabernacle they encamped. 19 And when the cloud prolonged on the tabernacle many days the Israelites kept the kept requirement of Yahweh and did not set out. 20 When the cloud remained a number of days on the tabernacle, on the command of Yahweh they encamped; and on the command of Yahweh they set out. 21 When the cloud remained from evening until morning, and the cloud lifted up in the morning, they would set out, or if it remained in the daytime and at night, when the cloud lifted up they set out. 22 When it was two days, a month, or a year that the cloud prolonged to dwell on the tabernacle, the Israelites encamped, and they did not set out; when it lifted up they set out. 23 On the command of Yahweh they encamped, and on the command of Yahweh they set out. They kept the requirement of Yahweh, on the command of Yahweh in the hand of Moses.

Numbers,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Make yourself two silver trumpets; make them of hammered-work. You will use them for calling the community and for breaking the camp. 3 You will blow them, and all the community will assemble to the doorway of the tent of assembly. 4 But if they blow only one, the leaders, the heads of the thousands of Israel, will assemble to you. 5 When you will blow a blast, the camps that are camping on the east will set out; 6 when you blow a second blast, the camps that are camping on the south will set out; they will blow a blast for their journeys. 7 But when summoning the assembly, you will blow, but you will not signal with a loud noise. 8 The sons of Aaron, the priests, will blow on the trumpets; this will be an eternal decree for your generations. 9 If you go to war in your land against the enemy who attacks you, you will signal with a loud noise on the trumpets. You will be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you will be rescued from your enemies. 10 “And on the day of your joy and in your appointed times, at the beginning of your months, you will blow on the trumpets in addition to your burnt offerings and in addition to the sacrifices of your fellowship offerings. And they will be as a memorial for you before your God; I am Yahweh your God.” 11 And it happened, in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month the cloud was lifted from upon the tabernacle of the testimony. 12 And the Israelites set out for their journey from the desert of Sinai, and the cloud dwelled in the desert of Paran. 13 They set out for the first time on the command of Yahweh in the hand of Moses. 14 The standard of the camp of the descendants of Judah set out for the first time according to their divisions, with Nahshon son of Amminadab over its division. 15 And Nathanel son of Zuar was over the division of the descendants of Issachar; 16 Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of the descendants of Zebulun. 17 The tabernacle was taken down, and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, the bearers of the tabernacle, set out. 18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their divisions; Elizur son of Shedeur was over their division. 19 Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the sons of the tribe of Simeon. 20 Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of the descendants of Gad. 21 The Kohathites, the bearers of the sanctuary, set out, and they set up the tabernacle before they arrived. 22 And the stand of the camp of the descendants of Ephraim set out according to their divisions; Elishama son of Ammihud was over its division. 23 Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of the descendants of Manasseh. 24 Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of the descendants of Benjamin. 25 Then the standard of the camp of the descendants of Dan, who formed a rear guard for all the camps, set out according to their divisions; Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was over its division. 26 Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of the descendants of Asher. 27 Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of the descendants of Naphtali. 28 These were the departures of the Israelites according to their divisions; and so they set out. 29 Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses, “We are setting out to the place that Yahweh said, ‘I will give it to you’; go with us, and we will treat you well because Yahweh promised good concerning Israel.” 30 But he said to him, “I will not go. I will only go to my land and to my family.” 31 He said, “Please, do not abandon us because you know our encampment in the desert, and you should be our guide. 32 Moreover, if you go with us, the good that Yahweh will do to us we will do to you.” 33 And so they set out from the mountain of Yahweh a journey of three days, with the ark of the covenant of Yahweh setting out ahead of them three days’ journey to search out a resting place for them; 34 and the cloud of Yahweh was over them by day when they set out from the camp. 35 And whenever the ark was setting out Moses would say, “Rise up, Yahweh! May your enemies be scattered; may the ones that hate you flee from your presence.” 36 And when it rested he would say, “Return, Yahweh, to the countless thousands of Israel.” 1 And it happened, the people were like those who complain of hardship in the hearing of Yahweh, and Yahweh became angry, and the fire of Yahweh burned among them, and it consumed the edge of the camp. 2 Then the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire died down. 3 And he called the name of that place Taberah because the fire of Yahweh burned among them. 4 The riff-raff that were in their midst had a strong desire; and the Israelites turned back and also wept, and they said, “Who will feed us meat? 5 We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumber, melon, leek, the onions, and the garlic.

Numbers,"5 We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumber, melon, leek, the onions, and the garlic. 6 But now our strength is dried up; there is nothing whatsoever except for the manna before us.” 7 Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its outward appearance was like that of bdellium-gum. 8 The people went about and gathered it, and they ground it with mills or crushed it with mortar. Then they boiled it in a pot and made it into bread-cakes; and it tasted like olive oil cakes. 9 When the dew came down on the camp at night, the manna came down with it. 10 Moses heard the people weeping according to their clans, each at the doorway of their tents. Then Yahweh became very angry, and in the eyes of Moses it was bad. 11 And Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have you brought trouble to your servant? Why have I not found favor in your eyes, that the burdens of all these people have been placed on me? 12 Did I conceive all these people? If I have fathered them, that you could say to me, ‘Carry them in your lap, just as a foster-father carries the suckling on the land that you swore an oath to their ancestors?’ 13 From where do I have meat to give all these people? They weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat and let us eat!’ 14 I am not able to carry all these people along alone; they are too heavy for me. 15 If this is how you are going to treat me, please kill me immediately if I find favor in your eyes, and do not let me see my misery.” 16 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather for me seventy men from the elders of Israel whom you know are elders of the people and their officials; take them to the tent of assembly, and they will stand there with you. 17 I will come down and speak with you there; I will take away from the spirit that is on you, and I will place it on them; and they will bear the burdens of the people with you; you will not bear it alone. 18 And you will say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves tomorrow, for you will eat meat because you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, “Who will feed us good meat? It was good for us in Egypt.” Yahweh will give to you meat, and you will eat. 19 You will eat, not one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, 20 but for a whole month, until it comes out from your nose and becomes as nausea to you; because you have rejected Yahweh, who is in your midst, and you wept before his presence, saying, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?” ’ ” 21 But Moses said, “There are six hundred thousand on foot, among whom I am in the midst, and you yourself said, ‘I will give meat to them, and they will eat for a whole month.’ 22 Should flocks and cattle be slaughtered for them? Should all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be enough for them?” 23 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Is Yahweh’s power limited? Now you will see if my word will happen or not.” 24 So Moses went out, and he spoke the words of Yahweh to the people, and he gathered together seventy men from the elders of the people, and he made them stand all around the tent. 25 Then Yahweh went down in the cloud and spoke to him, and he took away the spirit that was on him, and he put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the spirit was resting on them they prophesied, but they did not do it again. 26 But two men were left in the camp; the name of one was Eldad, and the name of the second was Medad, and the spirit rested on them; they were among those who were written down, but they did not go out to the tent, so they prophesied in the camp. 27 So a boy ran and told Moses and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.” 28 And Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from time of his youth, answered, “Moses, my lord, stop them.” 29 But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Would that he give all Yahweh’s people prophets, that Yahweh put his spirit on them!” 30 Then Moses and the elders of Israel were gathered to the camp. 31 Then a wind set out from Yahweh, and it drove quails from the west, and he spread them out on the camp about a day’s journey on one side and about a day’s journey on the other, all around the camp, about two cubits on the surface of the land. 32 And so the people worked all day and all night and all the next day, and they gathered the quail (the least of the ones collecting gathered ten homers). 33 While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was consumed, Yahweh was angry with the people, and Yahweh struck a very great plague among the people. 34 And he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah because they buried the people that were greedy. 35 From Kibroth Hattaavah the people set out to Hazeroth; and they stayed in Hazeroth. 1 And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he took (because he took a Cushite wife); 2 and they said, “Has Yahweh spoken only through Moses? Has not Yahweh also spoken through us?” And Yahweh heard it. 3 Now the man, Moses, was more humble than any other person on the face of the earth, 4 and Yahweh said suddenly to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “Go out, you three, to the tent of assembly.” So the three of them when out. 5 And Yahweh went down in a column of cloud and stood at the doorway of the tent, and he called Aaron and Miriam, and the two of them went, 6 and he said, “Please hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh, will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak to him in a dream. 7 Not so with my servant Moses; in all my house he is faithful. 8 I will speak to him mouth to mouth, in clearness, not in riddles; and he will look at the form of Yahweh. Why were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?” 9 And Yahweh became very angry with them, and he went away. 10 And the cloud departed from on the tent, and behold, Miriam was infected with a skin disease white like snow; when Aaron turned toward Miriam, behold, she was afflicted with a skin disease. 11 So Aaron said to Moses, “Please, my lord, please do not put on us this sin in which we were foolish and in which we have sinned. 12 Please do not let her be like the dead, whose flesh is half consumed when coming out from the womb of its mother.” 13 And Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “God, please heal her!” 14 But Yahweh said to Moses, “If her father had surely spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be confined for seven days to an outside place of the camp, and afterward she may be gathered.” 15 So Miriam was confined to the outside place of the camp seven days, and the people did not set out until Miriam was gathered. 16 And afterward the people set out from Hazeroth, and they encamped in the desert of Paran.

Numbers,"1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Send for yourself men, and let them explore the land of Canaan, which I am about to give to the Israelites; from each tribe of his father send one man, everyone a leader among them.” 3 So Moses sent them from the desert of Paran on the command of Yahweh; all of the men were leaders of the Israelites. 4 And these are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur; 5 from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori; 6 from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; 7 from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph; 8 from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun; 9 from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu; 10 from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi; 11 from the tribe of Joseph, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi son of Susi; 12 from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli; 13 from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael; 14 from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi; 15 from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki. 16 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore the land. And Moses called Hoshea son of Nun Joshua. 17 Moses sent them to explore the land of Canaan, and he said to them, “Go up like this to the Negev, and go up into the hill country, 18 and you will see what the land is like and if the people who inhabit it are strong or weak, or whether they are few or many, 19 and whether the land that they are inhabiting is good or bad, and whether the cities they are inhabiting are camps or fortifications, 20 and whether the land is fertile or lean, and whether there are trees on it or not. You will show yourself courageous, and you will take some of the fruit of the land.” It was the time of first ripe grapes. 21 So they went up and explored the land from the desert of Zin until Rehob, at Lebo Hamath. 22 They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai the descendants of the Anakites were. (Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 23 And they came up to the valley of Eshcol, and they cut off a vine branch and one cluster of grapes from there; they carried it on a pole between two men, with pomegranates and figs. 24 That place he called the valley of Eshcol on account of the cluster of grapes that the Israelites cut off from there. 25 They returned from exploring the land at the end of forty days. 26 And they came to Moses and Aaron and to the entire community of the Israelites in the desert of Paran at Kadesh; they brought back word to them and to all the community, and they showed them the fruit of the land. 27 And they told him, “We came to the land that you sent us, and it is flowing of milk and honey; this is its fruit. 28 Yet the people who are inhabiting it are strong and the cities are fortified and very large; moreover, we saw the descendants of the Anakites there. 29 The Amalekites are living in the land of the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and the Amorites are living in the hill country; and the Canaanites are living at the sea and on the banks of the Jordan.” 30 And Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, “Surely, let us go up and let us take possession of it because surely we will be able to prevail over it.” 31 And the men who went up with him said, “We are not able to go up to the people because they are stronger than us.” 32 And they presented the report of the land that they explored to the Israelites, saying, “The land that we went through to explore is a land that eats its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in its midst are men of great size. 33 There we saw the Nephilim (the descendants of Anak came from the Nephilim), and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their eyes.” 1 Then all the community lifted up their voices, and the people wept during that night. 2 And all the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and all the community said to them, “If only we had died in the land of Egypt or in this desert! 3 Why did Yahweh bring us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little children will become plunder; would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?” 4 They said to each other, “Let us appoint a leader, and we will return to Egypt.” 5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the assembly of the community of the Israelites. 6 Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, from the explorers of the land, tore their garments. 7 And they said to all the community of the Israelites, “The land that we went through to explore is an exceptionally good land. 8 If Yahweh delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and he will give it to us, a land that is flowing with milk and honey. 9 Only do not rebel against Yahweh, and you will not fear the people of the land, because they will be our food. Their protection has been turned from them; Yahweh is with us. You should not fear them.” 10 And all the community said to stone them with stones, but the glory of Yahweh appeared in the tent of assembly among the Israelites. 11 And Yahweh said to Moses, “How long until this people will despise me, and how long until they will not believe in me, and in all the signs that I have done in their midst? 12 I will strike them with disease, and I will dispossess them; I will make you into a greater and stronger nation than them.” 13 And Moses said to Yahweh, “Then the Egyptians will hear that you brought up this people from their midst in your power, 14 and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They heard that you, Yahweh, are in the midst of this people, that you are seen eye to eye, and your cloud is standing over them, and in a column of cloud you go before them by day and in a column of fire at night. 15 But if you destroy this people all at once, the nations that will have heard your message will say, 16 ‘Yahweh was unable to bring this people in the land that he swore by an oath, and he slaughtered them in the desert.’ 17 But now, please, let the power of my Lord be great, just has you spoke, 18 ‘Yahweh is slow to anger and great of loyal love, forgiving sin and rebellion; but surely he leaves nothing unpunished, visiting the sin of the fathers on the sons to the third and fourth generations.’ 19 Please forgive the sin of this people according to the greatness of your loyal love, just as you forgave this people, from Egypt until now.” 20 Yahweh said, “I have forgiven them according to your word; 21 but as I am alive, the glory of Yahweh will fill all the earth. 22 But because all the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I did in Egypt and in the desert yet tested me these ten times and did not listen to my voice, 23 they will not see the land that I swore by oath to their ancestors, and all those who despised me will not see it. 24 But my servant Caleb, because another spirit was with him, he remained true after me, and I will bring him into the land that he entered, and his offspring will take possession of it. 25 And the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys; tomorrow turn and set out for the desert by way of the Red Sea.” 26 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 27 “How long will I bear this evil community who are grumbling against me? I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites which they are making against me. 28 Say to them, ‘Surely as I live,’ declares Yahweh, ‘just as you spoke in my hearing, so I will do to you; 29 in this desert your corpses will fall, and all your counted ones, according to all your number, from twenty years old and above who grumbled against me. 30 You yourselves will not come into the land that I swore by oath to make you to dwell in it, but Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. 31 But your little children, whom you said would be plunder, I will bring them, and they will know the land that you rejected. 32 But for you, all your corpses will fall in this desert. 33 And your children will be shepherds in the desert forty years, and you will bear your unfaithfulness until all your corpses have fallen in the desert. 34 According to the number of the days that you explored the land, forty days, a day for each year, you will bear your sins forty years, and you will know my opposition.’ 35 I, Yahweh, have spoken; I will surely do this to all this evil community who has banded together against me. In this desert they will come to an end, and there they will die.” 36 As for the men whom Moses sent to explore the land, who returned and made the community grumble against him by spreading a report over the land, 37 the men who spread the evil report of the land died by the plague before Yahweh. 38 But Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh lived from among the men who went to explore the land. 39 And Moses spoke words to all the Israelites, and the people mourned greatly. 40 They rose early in the morning and went to the top of the mount, saying, “Here we are. We will go up to the place that Yahweh said, because we have sinned.” 41 But Moses said, “Why are you going against the command of Yahweh? It will not succeed. 42 You should not go up because Yahweh is not in your midst; do not let yourselves be defeated in the presence of your enemies, 43 because the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you will fall by the sword; because you have turned back from Yahweh, and Yahweh will not be with you.” 44 But they dared to go to the top of the mountain, and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and Moses did not depart from the midst of the camp. 45 So the Amalekites and the Canaanites who were living on the mountain descended, and they beat them down, up to Hormah.

Numbers,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘When you come into the land of your dwellings that I am about to give to you, 3 you will make an offering by fire for Yahweh from the cattle or from the flock, a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, or as a freewill offering or at your feasts, to make a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh. 4 And the one who presents an offering for Yahweh, he will present a grain offering of finely milled flour; a tenth will be mixed with a fourth of the liquid measure of oil; 5 and you will add a fourth of wine for the libation upon the burnt offering, or to the sacrifice for each ram-lamb. 6 Or for the ram you will make a grain offering of two-tenths of finely milled flour mixed into a third of a liquid measure of oil. 7 You will present a third of the liquid measure of wine for the libation, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh. 8 When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a vow or a fellowship offering for Yahweh, 9 you will present with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of finely milled flour mixed with half a liquid measure of oil, 10 and you will present half a liquid measure of wine as a libation, as an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh. 11 “ ‘This is how it should be done for each bull, or for the each ram, or for the small four-footed mammal, or ram-lambs, or goats. 12 According to the number that you prepare, so should you do to each according to their number. 13 Every native must do these things to present an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh. 14 If an alien dwells among you, or whoever is in your midst throughout your generations, and prepares an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh, he should do as you do. 15 For the assembly, there will be one decree for you and for the alien who dwells among you; it is an eternal decree for all your generations. You as well as the alien will be before Yahweh. 16 There will be one law and one stipulation for you and for the alien dwelling among you.’ ” 17 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 18 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘When you come into the land to which I am about to bring you, 19 whenever you eat from the food of the land, you will lift up a contribution to Yahweh. 20 You must lift up a contribution of the first batch of your ring-shaped dough bread; you must lift it up as a contribution of the threshing floor. 21 You will give to Yahweh a contribution from the first of your dough throughout your generations. 22 “ ‘But if you go astray and you do not follow all these commandments that Yahweh commanded to Moses, 23 all that Yahweh commanded you by the hand of Moses from the day that Yahweh commanded and beyond, throughout your generations, 24 and if it was done unintentionally without the knowledge of the community, then the entire community must prepare one young bull as a burnt offering, as a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh, and its grain offering and its libation, according to the stipulation, and one male goat as a sin offering. 25 The priest will make atonement for all of the community of the Israelites, and they will be forgiven because it was unintentional; they will bring their offering, an offering made by fire for Yahweh, their sin offering before Yahweh for their unintentional sin. 26 All of the community of the Israelites will be forgiven, as well as the alien that dwells in their midst, because the whole community was involved in the unintentional wrong. 27 “ ‘If one person sins unintentionally, that person will present a female goat in its first year as a sin offering. 28 And the priest will make atonement for the person who sinned unintentionally before Yahweh, to make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven. 29 For the native among the Israelites and the alien that dwells in their midst, there will be one law for anyone who commits an unintentional wrong. 30 But the one who acts presumptuously from among the native or alien blasphemes against Yahweh, and that person must be cut off from the midst of the people. 31 Because he despised the word of Yahweh and broke his command, that person will be surely cut off and bear the guilt.’ ” 32 When the Israelites were in the desert, they found a man who was gathering wood on the day of the Sabbath. 33 The ones who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and to all the community. 34 And they put him under watch because it was not made clear what should be done to him. 35 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Surely the man must be put to death by stoning him; all the community must stone him with stones from outside the camp.” 36 So the entire community brought him out to a place outside the camp, and they stoned him to death just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 37 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 38 “Speak to the Israelites, and tell them to make for themselves tassels on the hems of their garments throughout their generations and to put a blue cord on the tassel of the hem. 39 You will have a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commands of Yahweh and do them, and not follow after the unfaithfulness of your own heart and eyes, 40 so that you will remember and do all my commandments, and you will be holy for your God. 41 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God; I am Yahweh your God.” 1 Now Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, the descendants of Reuben, 2 took two hundred and fifty men from the Israelites, leaders of the community summoned from the assembly, renowned men, and they confronted Moses. 3 They were assembled in front of Moses and Aaron, and they said to them, “You take too much upon yourselves! All of the community is holy, every one of them, and Yahweh is in their midst, so why do you raise yourselves over the assembly of Yahweh?” ",Numbers 15:1-16:3,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/numbers-151163-256075/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-02-15_numbers-151163_20120125135304.mp3
Numbers,"4 When Moses heard this, he fell on his face. 5 And he said to Korah and to his entire company, saying, “Tomorrow morning Yahweh will make known who is his and who is holy, and he will bring him near to him, whomever he chooses he will bring near to him. 6 Do this: take for yourselves censers, Korah and all of your company; 7 tomorrow put fire in them and place incense on them before Yahweh; the man whom Yahweh chooses will be the holy one. You take too much upon yourselves, sons of Levi!” 8 And Moses said to Korah, “Please listen, sons of Levi! 9 Is it too little for you that the God of Israel set you apart from the community of Israel to allow you to approach him to do the work of the tabernacle of Yahweh, to stand before the community to serve them? 10 He has allowed you to approach him, you with all your brothers, the descendants of Levi, but yet you also seek the priesthood. 11 Therefore you and your company that has banded together against Yahweh. What is Aaron that you grumble against him?” 12 Moses sent to call for Dathan and Abiram son of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come! 13 Is it too little that you have brought us from a land that flows with milk and honey to kill us in the desert, and that you also appoint yourself as a ruler over us? 14 Surely, you have not brought us to a land that flows with milk and honey, and you have not given us the inheritance of fields and a vineyard. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come!” 15 Then Moses became angry, and he said to Yahweh, “Do not notice their grain offering. I have not offered one donkey from them, and I have not mistreated one of them.” 16 And Moses said to Korah, “You and your entire company will be before Yahweh tomorrow, you and they and Aaron. 17 Each one take his censer, and put incense on it and you will present it before Yahweh, and each of you bring his censer, two hundred and fifty censers, you and Aaron, each his censer.” 18 So each of them took his censer, and they put fire on them, and they placed incense on them; they stood at the doorway of the tent of the assembly of Moses and Aaron. 19 And Korah summoned them, the entire community, by the doorway of the tent of assembly, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the community. 20 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 21 “Separate yourselves from the midst of this community, that I can destroy them in a moment.” 22 And they fell on their faces, and they said, “God, God of the spirits of all flesh, will one man sin and you become angry toward the entire community?” 23 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 24 “Speak to the community, saying, ‘Move away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’ ” 25 So Moses stood up and went to Dathan and Abiram; the elders of Israel followed after him. 26 He said to the community, saying, “Please turn away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything that belongs to them, or you will be destroyed with all their sins.” 27 And so they moved away from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out standing at the doorway of their tents, with their wives, sons, and little children. 28 And Moses said, “In this you will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; it is not from my heart. 29 If they die a natural death or if a natural fate is visited upon them, Yahweh has not sent me. 30 But if Yahweh creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up and all that belongs to them, and they go down alive to Sheol, and you will know that these men have despised Yahweh.” 31 And it happened, as soon as he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split open. 32 The land opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their houses and every person that belonged to Korah and all the property. 33 They went down alive to Sheol, they and all that belonged to them, and the land covered over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly. 34 All Israel who were around them fled at their cry, because they said, “Lest the land swallow us up!” 35 And fire went out from Yahweh, and it consumed the two hundred and fifty men presenting the incense. 36 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 37 “Say to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, ‘Take out the censers from among the place of burning because they are sacred, and scatter the fire outside. 38 The censers of these who have sinned at the cost of their lives, let them be made into gilded leafing plating for the altar; because they presented them before Yahweh, they are holy; and they will be a sign for the Israelites.’ ” 39 Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that the ones who were burned presented, and they hammered them out thinly as plating for the altar; 40 it was a memorial for the Israelites, so that no strange man who is not from the offspring of Aaron should approach the presence of Yahweh to burn a smoke offering; he will not be like Korah and his company, just as Yahweh had spoken to him by the hand of Moses. 41 The next day all the community of the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of Yahweh!” 42 Then, when the community had gathered against Moses and Aaron, they turned to the tent of assembly, and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared. 43 And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of assembly, 44 and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 45 “Get away from the midst of this community, and I will finish them in an instant,” but they fell on their faces. 46 And Moses and Aaron said, “Take the censer, and put fire on it from the altar. Place incense on it, and bring it quickly to the community, and make atonement for them, because wrath went out from the presence of Yahweh, and a plague has begun.” 47 And so Aaron took it just as Moses had spoken, and he ran into the midst of the assembly, for behold, the plague had begun among the people; so he gave the incense and made atonement for the people. 48 He stood between the dead and between the living, and the plague was stopped. 49 Those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died on account of Korah. 50 Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the tent of assembly, and the plague was stopped. 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Speak to the Israelites, and take from among them twelve staffs, a staff from each family from among all their leaders according to their families’ households. Write the name of each man on his staff, 3 and the name of Aaron on the staff of Levi, because one staff is for the head of each of their families. 4 You must then put them in the tent of assembly before the testimony where I meet with you. 5 And it will happen, the man whom I will choose, his staff will blossom, and so I will rid from upon myself the grumblings of the Israelites, who are grumbling against you.” 6 Moses spoke to the Israelites, and all their leaders gave him a staff for each leader, one from each of their families, twelve staffs, and the staff of Aaron was in the midst of their tribes. 7 And Moses put the staffs before Yahweh in the tent of testimony. 8 Then the next day, Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and behold the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi blossomed and put forth a flower and produced blossoms, and it produced almonds. 9 Then Moses brought out to all the Israelites all the staffs before the presence of Yahweh, and they saw, and each man took his staff. 10 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Bring back the staff of Aaron before the testimony as a guard and sign for the children of rebellion, and let them finish their grumblings before me and not die.” 11 So Moses did; just as Yahweh commanded him, so he did. 12 And the Israelites said to Moses, saying, “Look! We will die! We will be destroyed! All of us will perish! 13 Anyone who approaches the tabernacle of Yahweh will die. Will we all die?” ",Numbers 16:4-17:13,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/numbers-1641713-256076/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-02-16_numbers-1641713_20120125135458.mp3
Numbers,"1 Yahweh said to Aaron, “You, your sons, and your family with you will bear the guilt of the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you will bear the guilt of your priesthood. 2 Moreover, bring your brothers with you, the tribe of Levi the tribe of your father, that they may be joined to you and minister to you, you and your sons with you before the tent of testimony. 3 They will keep your responsibility and the responsibility of all the tent, only they may not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, so both you and they will not die. 4 They will be joined to you, and they will keep the responsibility of the tent of assembly for the entire service of the tent; a stranger may not come near you. 5 You will keep the responsibility of the sanctuary and the responsibility of the altar, and there will no longer be wrath on the Israelites. 6 Look, I myself have chosen your brothers the Levites from the midst of the children. They are a gift to you given from Yahweh to perform the work of the tent of assembly. 7 But you with your sons will keep your priesthood to perform your priestly duties for everything at the altar and for the area behind the curtain. I give you the priesthood as a gift, but the stranger who approaches will be put to death.” 8 Yahweh spoke to Aaron, “Behold, I myself have given to you the responsibility of my contributions for all the holy objects of the Israelites; I have given them as a portion to you and your sons as an eternal decree. 9 This will be for you from the sanctuary of the holy things from the fire; all of their offerings, from every grain offering, from every sin offering, and from every guilt offering which they will bring to me is a most holy thing for you and your sons. 10 You will eat it in the most holy place; every male will eat it. It will be a holy object to you. 11 This is also for you: the contribution of their gift of the wave offerings of the children Israel. I have given them to you and your sons and your daughters with you as an eternal decree; whoever is clean in your house may eat it. 12 All the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and their best grain that they have given to Yahweh, I have given them to you. 13 The firstfruits of all that is in their land that they present to Yahweh will be for you; whoever is clean in your house may eat it. 14 All consecrated possessions in Israel will be for you. 15 All the first offspring of a womb of any creature that they offer to Yahweh, whether human or animal, will be yours; you will surely redeem the firstborn of the human and the unclean firstborn of the animal. 16 As to their price of redemption, from a one-month-old you will redeem them according to your proper value, five shekels of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerah. 17 Only the firstborn of an ox or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat you will not redeem; they are holy. Their blood you will sprinkle over the altar, and their fat you will turn into smoke as an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh. 18 But their flesh will be for you like the breast section of the wave offering, and it will be for you like the right upper thigh. 19 All the contributions of holiness that the Israelites offer to Yahweh I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you as an eternal decree; it is an eternal covenant of salt before Yahweh to you and your offspring with you.” 20 Then Yahweh said to Aaron, “You will not receive an inheritance in their land, and there will not be a plot of ground for you in the midst of the Israelites. 21 “Behold, I have given to the descendants of Levi every tithe in Israel as an inheritance in return for their service, which they are doing, the work of the tent of assembly. 22 The Israelites will not come near again to the tent of assembly, or they will bear sin and die. 23 The Levites will perform the service of the tent of assembly, and they will bear their guilt, an eternal decree for all your generations. But they will not receive an inheritance in the midst of the Israelites 24 because the tithes of the Israelites that are offered to Yahweh as a contribution, I have given to the Levites as an inheritance; therefore I said to them, ‘They will not receive an inheritance in the midst of the Israelites.’ ” 25 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 26 “You will speak to the Levites and say to them, ‘When you receive the tithe from the Israelites that I have given to you from them for your inheritance, you will present a contribution from it to Yahweh, a tithe from a tithe. 27 Your contribution will be credited to you like the grain from the threshing floor and like the produce from the press. 28 So you will present your own contribution to Yahweh from all your tithes that you receive from the Israelites; from it you will give the contribution of Yahweh to Aaron the priest. 29 From all your gifts you will present every contribution of Yahweh, from all its fat, the part that is sacred.’ 30 You will say to them, ‘When you are presenting its fat, the rest will be credited to the Levites like a yield of the threshing floor and like a yield from the press. 31 You may eat it anywhere, you and your household, because it is a wage in return for your service in the tent of assembly. 32 You will not bear any sin because you have presented its fat; you will not defile the holy objects of the Israelites, or you will die.’ ” 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 2 “This is the decree of the law that Yahweh has commanded, saying, ‘Speak to the Israelites and let them take to you a red heifer without a physical defect, on which a yoke has not been placed. 3 And you will give it to Eleazar the priest, and it will be brought out to a place outside the camp, and it will be slaughtered in his presence. 4 Then Eleazar the priest will take some of its blood on his finger and spatter it toward the mouth of the tent of assembly seven times. 5 The heifer will be burned in his sight; its skin, its meat, and its blood, in addition to its offal, will burn. 6 The priest will take cedar wood, hyssop, and crimson thread, and he will throw them in the midst of the burning heifer. 7 The priest will wash his garments and his body in the water, and afterward he will come to the camp; the priest will be unclean until the evening. 8 The one who burns it will wash his garments and his body in water; he will be unclean until the evening. 9 A clean man will gather the ashes of the heifer, and he will put them in a clean place outside the camp; it will be for the community of the Israelites as a requirement for waters of impurity; it is a purification offering. 10 The one who gathers the ashes of the heifer will wash his garments; he will be unclean until evening. It will be an eternal decree for the Israelites and for one who dwells as an alien in their midst. 11 “ ‘The one who touches a corpse of any person will be unclean for seven days. 12 He will purify himself on the third day, and on the seventh day he will be clean. If he does not purify himself on the third day, he will not be clean on the seventh day. 13 Anyone who touches a corpse, the person of a human being who died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of Yahweh, and that person will be cut off from Israel because the waters of impurity were not sprinkled on him. He will still be unclean, and uncleanness is on him. 14 “ ‘This is the law of a person who dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and all who are in the tent will be unclean seven days. 15 Every container that is opened that does not have a lid cord on it is unclean. 16 Anyone in the open field who touches one who has been slain, or a corpse, or a bone of a person, or a burial site, he will be unclean for seven days. 17 For the unclean person they will take from the powder of the burnt purification offering, and they will put running water into a container. 18 A clean person will take hyssop and dip it into the water and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the objects and persons who were there, and on one who touched the bone, or the one slain, or the dead, or the burial site. 19 The clean person will spatter the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he will purify him, and he will wash his garments; he will bathe in the waters, and in the evening he will be clean. 20 But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person will be cut off from the midst of the assembly because he defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh; the water of impurity was not sprinkled on him; he is unclean. 21 “ ‘It will be an eternal decree for them. The one who spatters the waters of impurity will wash his garments, and the one who touches the waters of impurity will be unclean until the evening. 22 Anything that the unclean person touches will be unclean, and the person who touches it will be unclean until the evening.’ ” ","Numbers 18, 19",http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/numbers-18-19-256077/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-02-17_numbers-18-19_20120125135505.mp3
Numbers,"1 Then the entire community of the Israelites came to the desert of Zin on the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh; Miriam died and was buried there. 2 There was no water for the community, and they were gathered before Moses and Aaron. 3 And the people quarreled with Moses and spoke, saying, “If only we died when our brothers were dying before Yahweh! 4 Why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh, us and our livestock, into this desert to die here? 5 Why have you brought us from Egypt to bring us to this bad place? It is not a place of seed or figs or vines or pomegranate trees, and there is not water to drink.” 6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of assembly. They fell on their faces, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them. 7 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 8 “Take the staff and summon the community, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will give water. Bring out for them water from the rock, and let the community and their livestock drink.” 9 So Moses took the staff from before Yahweh just as he command him, 10 and Moses and Aaron summoned the assembly to the presence of the rock, and he said to them, “Please listen, you rebels; can we bring out water for you from this rock?” 11 Then Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice. And abundant water went out, and the community and their livestock drank. 12 But Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you have not trusted in me, to regard me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this assembly into the land that I have given to them.” 13 Those were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with Yahweh, and he showed himself holy among them. 14 From Kadesh Moses sent messengers to the king of Edom: “Thus your brother Israel has said, ‘You know all the hardship that has found us; 15 our ancestors went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors. 16 Then we cried to Yahweh, and he heard our voice; he sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt. And look, we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory. 17 Please let us go through your land. We will not go through a field or vineyard, and we will not drink water from a well. We will go along the road of the king; we will not turn aside right or left until we have gone through your territory.’ ” 18 Then Edom said to him, “You will not pass through us lest we will go out to meet you with the sword.” 19 The Israelites said to him, “We will go up on the main road, and if we and our livestock drink your water, we will pay for it. It is only a small matter; let us pass through on our feet.” 20 But he said, “You will not go through.” And Edom went out to meet them with a large army and a strong hand. 21 So Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory, and Israel turned aside from him. 22 And they set out from Kadesh. The Israelites, the whole community, came to Mount Hor. 23 Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron on Mount Hor, on the boundary of the land of Edom, saying, 24 “Let Aaron be gathered to his people; he will not come into the land that I have given to the Israelites because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah. 25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and take them up Mount Hor. 26 Strip off Aaron’s garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; Aaron will be gathered to his people, and he will die there.” 27 So Moses did just as Yahweh commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor before the eyes of all the community. 28 And Moses stripped off Aaron’s garments and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there on the top of the mountain; and Moses and Eleazar went down from the mountain. 29 All the community saw that Aaron died; so all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.

Numbers,"1 The Canaanite king of Arad, who was dwelling in the Negev, heard that Israel came along the way of Atharim; he fought against Israel and took some of them captive. 2 Israel made a vow to Yahweh, and they said, “If you will surely give this people into our hand, then we will destroy their cities.” 3 Yahweh heard the voice of Israel; he gave to them the Canaanites, and they destroyed them and their cities. They called the name of the place Hormah. 4 They set out from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom; but the people became impatient along the way. 5 The people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us from Egypt to die in the desert? There is no food and no water, and our hearts detest this miserable food.” 6 And Yahweh sent among the people poisonous snakes; they bit the people, and many people from Israel died. 7 The people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned because we have spoken against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh and let him remove the snakes from among us.” So Moses prayed for the people. 8 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Make for yourself a snake and place it on a pole. When anyone is bitten and looks at it, that person will live.” 9 So Moses made a snake of bronze, and he placed it on the pole; whenever a snake bit someone, and that person looked at the snake of bronze, he lived. 10 The Israelites set out and encamped at Oboth. 11 They set out from Oboth and encamped at Iye Abarim in the desert, which was in front of Moab toward the sunrise. 12 From there they set out and encamped at the valley of Zered. 13 From there they set out and encamped beyond Arnon, which is in the desert that goes out from the boundary of the Amorites, because Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 14 Therefore thus it is said in the scroll of the Wars of Yahweh, “Waheb in Suphah, and the wadis of Arnon, 15 and the slope of the wadis that spreads out to the dwelling of Ar and lies at the boundary of Moab.” 16 From there they went to Beer, which is the water well where Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Gather the people, that I may give them water.” 17 Then Israel sang this song, “Arise, well water! Sing to it! 18 Well water that the princes dug, that the leaders of the people dug, with a staff and with their rods.” And from the desert they continued to Mattanah, 19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; 20 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the territory of Moab, by the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the surface of the wasteland. 21 Israel sent messengers to Sihon, the king of the Amorites, saying, 22 “Let us go through your land; we will not turn aside into a field or vineyard; we will not drink well water along the way of the king until we have gone through your territory.” 23 But Sihon did not allow Israel to go through his territory. Sihon gathered all his people and went out to meet Israel; he came to the desert, to Jahaz, and he fought against Israel. 24 But Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and they took possession of his land from Arnon to Jabbok, until the Ammonites, because the boundary of the Ammonites was strong. 25 Israel took all these cities, and Israel inhabited all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its environs. 26 Because Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land from his hand until Arnon. 27 Thus the ones who quote proverbs say, “Come to Heshbon! Let it be built! And let the city of Sihon be established. 28 Because fire went out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of Arnon. 29 Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, people of Chemosh. He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to the king of the Amorites, Sihon. 30 We destroyed them; Heshbon has perished up to Dibon; we laid waste up to Nophah, which reaches Medeba.” 31 Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. 32 Moses sent to explore Jaazer; they captured its environs and dispossessed the Amorites who were there. 33 Then they turned and went up by the way of the Bashan, and Og king of the Bashan and all his people went out to meet them for battle at Edrei. 34 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Do not fear him because I will give him and all his people and all his land into your hand. You will do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who was living in Heshbon.” 35 And so they destroyed him and his sons, and all his people until they had not spared a survivor; and they took possession of his land. 1 The Israelites set out, and they encamped on the desert-plateau of Moab, across from Jericho beyond the Jordan. 2 Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel did to the Amorites, 3 and Moab was very terrified in the presence of the people because they were numerous; and Moab dreaded the presence of the Israelites. 4 And Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now the crowd will lick up all around us, like a bull devours the grass of the field.” And Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 5 He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the river, in the land of the children of his people, to summon him, saying, “Look! A people went out from Egypt. Look! They cover the surface of the land; they are about to dwell opposite me.

Numbers,"6 Now, please go, curse this people for me because they are stronger than me; perhaps I will be able to strike them and drive them out from the land because I know whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you cursed is cursed.” 7 So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went with a fee for divination in their hand; they came to Balaam and spoke the words of Balak to him. 8 He said to them, “Spend the night here, and I will return, and I will return word to you, just as Yahweh speaks to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. 9 And God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?” 10 And Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent word to me, 11 ‘Look! A people went out from Egypt. Look! They cover the surface of the land. Now, go, curse them for me. Perhaps I will be able to attack them and drive them out.” 12 God said to Balaam, “You will not go with them; you will not curse the people, because they are blessed.” 13 Balaam got up in the morning, and he said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land, because Yahweh refused to allow me to go with you.” 14 The princes of Moab got up and went to Balak, and they said, “Balaam refused to come with us.” 15 Balak again sent many princes, who were more honored than the former. 16 They came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak son of Zippor, ‘Please, let nothing keep you from coming to me 17 because I will surely honor you greatly, and all that you say to me I will do. Please, come; curse this people for me.’ ” 18 Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, “Even though Balak gives to me his house full of silver and gold, I am not able to go beyond the command of Yahweh my God to do a little or a lot. 19 And now please, you also stay here the night, and let me find out again what Yahweh will say with me.” 20 And God came to Balaam at night, and he said to him, “If the men have come to call you, get up and go with them; but only the word that I will speak to you, you will do.” 21 So Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey, and he went with the princes of Moab. 22 But God became angry because he was going, and the angel of Yahweh stood in the road as an adversary to him; he was riding on his donkey, and two servants were with him. 23 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, and the donkey turned aside from the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back to the road. 24 The angel of Yahweh stood in the narrow path of the vineyards, with a wall on either side. 25 When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she pressed herself into the wall, and she pressed the foot of Balaam into the wall, so he struck her again. 26 Then the angel of Yahweh went further ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was not a way to turn aside to the right or left. 27 When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she lay down under Balaam, so Balaam became angry, and he struck the donkey with his staff. 28 Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What did I do to you that you struck me these three times?” 29 Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you made a mockery of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now!” 30 The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life until this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?” He said, “No.” 31 Then Yahweh exposed the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, and he bowed down and worshiped to his face. 32 The angel of Yahweh said to him, “Why have you struck this donkey three times? Look, I have come out as an adversary because your conduct is perverse before me. 33 The donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times. If she had not turned aside from my face, then I would have killed you and kept her alive.” 34 Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, “I have sinned because I did not know that you were standing to meet me in the road. Now, if it is displeasing to you, I will turn back.” 35 The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only the word that I will speak to you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 36 When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him by the city of Moab, which was on the boundary of Aaron at the end of the territory. 37 And Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not urgently send to meet with you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really not able to honor you?” 38 Balaam said to Balak, “Look, I came to you now. Am I really able to speak anything at all? I speak the word that God puts in my mouth.” 39 Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-Huzoth. 40 And Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and he sent them to Balaam and to the princes who were with him. 41 And it happened, in the morning Balak took Balaam and took him up to Bamoth-Baal, and he saw from there the end of the nation. 1 Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me this: seven altars. And prepare for me this: seven bulls and seven rams.” 2 And Balak did just as Balaam spoke, and Balak offered Balaam a bull and a ram on the altar. 3 And Balaam said to Balak, “Station yourself at your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell to you.” So he went to a barren height. 4 And God met with Balaam, and he said to him, “I have arranged seven altars, and I have offered a bull and a ram on the altar.” 5 Yahweh put a word in the mouth of Balaam and said, “Return to Balak, and you must speak thus.” 6 So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab. 7 And he lifted up his oracle and said, “From Aram Balak lead me, from the mountains of the east the king of Moab, ‘Go for me, curse Jacob, and go, denounce Israel.’ 8 How can I curse whom God has not cursed, and how can I denounce whom Yahweh has not denounced? 9 Because from the top of the rocks I see him, from hilltops I watch him. Behold, a people who dwell alone, they do not consider themselves among the nations. 10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, or as a number the fourth part of Israel? Let my life die the death of an upright person, and let my end be like his!” 11 And Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have surely blessed them!” 12 He answered and said, “Should I not speak what Yahweh puts in my mouth?” 13 Then Balak said, “Please walk with me to another place where you will see them, but you will only see part of them and will not see all of them; and curse them for me from there.” 14 So he took him to the field of Zophim to the top of Pisgah, and he built seven altars, and he offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 15 Balaam said to Balak, “Station yourself here at the burnt offering while I myself meet with Yahweh there.” 16 Then Yahweh met with Balaam, and he put a word in his mouth, and he said, “Return to Balak, and you must speak thus.” 17 He came to him, and behold, he was standing at his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, “What has Yahweh spoken?” 18 Then he uttered his oracle, and said, “Stand up, Balak, and hear; listen to me, son of Zippor! 19 God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of humankind, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? And has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it? 20 Behold, I have received a command to bless; when he has blessed, I cannot cause it to return. 21 He has no regard for evil in Jacob, and he does not see trouble in Israel; Yahweh his God is with him, and a shout of a king is among them. 22 God, who brings them out from Egypt, is like the strength of a wild ox for them. 23 Because there is no sorcery against Jacob, and there is no divination against Israel. Now it will be said to Jacob and Israel, what God has done! 24 Look! the people will rise like the lion; he raises himself and will not lie down until he eats the prey and drinks the blood of the slain.” 25 Then Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them at all, nor bless them at all!” 26 But Balaam answered and said to Balak, “Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘Whatever Yahweh speaks I will do’?” 27 Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please, come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will be acceptable to God, and you will curse for me from there.” 28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which looks down on the face of the Jeshimon. 29 And Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me these seven altars, and prepare for me these seven bulls and seven rams.” 30 Balak did just as Balaam said, and he offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 1 And Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel, and he did not go as other times to seek out sorcery; instead, he set his face toward the desert. 2 Balaam lift up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to its tribes, and the spirit of God was upon it. 3 He uttered his oracle and said, “The declaration of Balaam son Beor, the declaration of the man whose eyes are closed, 4 the declaration of the hearer of God’s words, who sees the revelation of Shaddai, falling down but whose eyes are uncovered. 5 How good are your tents, O Jacob, your dwellings, O Israel! 6 They are spread out like valleys, like gardens on a river, like aloes planted by Yahweh, like cedars at the waters. 7 He will pour water from his buckets, and his offspring will be like many waters; his king will be higher than Agag, and his kingdom will be exalted. 8 God, who brings him out from Egypt, is like the strength of a wild ox for him. He will devour the nations who are his enemies; he will break their bones; he will pierce them with his arrows. 9 He crouches, he lies down like a lion, and like a lioness, who will rouse him? They who bless you will be blessed, and they who curse you will be cursed.” 10 Then Balak became angry with Balaam, and he clapped his hands and said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, but look, you have surely blessed them these three times. 11 Flee to your place now. I said I would richly honor you, but look, Yahweh has withheld honor from you.” 12 Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, 13 ‘If Balak gave to me the fullness of his house full of silver and gold, I am not able to go beyond the command of Yahweh to do good or evil, from my heart; what Yahweh speaks, I will speak’? 14 And now, look, I am about to go to my people; I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the following days.” ",Numbers 22:6-24:14,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/numbers-2262414-256080/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-02-22_numbers-2262414_20120125165658.mp3
Numbers,"15 And he uttered his oracle and said, “The declaration of Balaam son of Beor, and the declaration of the man whose eye is closed, 16 the declaration of the hearer of God’s words, and the knower of the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of Shaddai, who is falling, and his eyes are revealed. 17 I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; a star will go out from Jacob, and a scepter will rise from Israel; it will crush the foreheads of Moab and destroy all the children of Seth. 18 Edom will be a captive; Seir, its enemies, will be a captive, and Israel will be acting courageously. 19 Someone from Jacob will rule and will destroy a remnant from the city.” 20 And he looked at Amalek, uttered his oracle, and said, “Amalek is first of the nations, but his future will be forever ruin.” 21 And he looked at the Kenites, uttered his oracle, and said, “Steady is your dwelling place; in the rock is your nest. 22 Nevertheless, the Kenite will be burned; how long will Asshur keep you captive?” 23 Again he uttered his oracle and said, “Woe, who will live when God establishes this? 24 The ships will come from the hand of the Kittim, and they will afflict Asshur and will afflict Eber; also he will be forever ruin.” 25 Then Balaam got up and went and returned to his place, and Balak also went on his way. 1 When Israel dwelled in Shittim, the people began to prostitute themselves with the daughters of Moab. 2 And they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and worshiped their gods. 3 So Israel was joined together to Baal Peor, and Yahweh became angry with Israel. 4 Yahweh said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of the people and kill them before the sun, so the fierce anger of Yahweh will turn from Israel.” 5 So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you kill his men who are joined together with Baal Peor.” 6 And behold, a man from the Israelites came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman before the eyes of Moses and before the eyes of all of the community of the Israelites, and they were weeping at the doorway of the tent of assembly. 7 When Phinehas son of Eleazar son of Aaron the priest saw, he got up from the midst of the community and took a spear in his hand. 8 He went after the man of Israel into the woman’s section of the tent, and he drove the two of them, the man of Israel and the woman, into her belly. And the plague among the Israelites stopped. 9 The ones who died in the plague were twenty-four thousand. 10 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 11 “Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, turned away my anger from among the Israelites when he was jealous with my jealousy in their midst, and I did not destroy the Israelites with my jealousy. 12 Therefore say, ‘Behold, I am giving to him my covenant of peace, 13 and it will be for him and his offspring after him a covenant of an eternal priesthood because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the Israelites.’ ” 14 The name of the man of Israel who was struck with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, a leader of the family of the Simeonites. 15 The name of the Midianite woman who was struck was Cozbi daughter of Zur, a leader of a tribe of the family in Midian. 16 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 17 “Attack the Midianites and strike them 18 because they were attacking you with their deception, with which they have deceived you on the matter of Peor and on the matter of Cozbi the daughter of the leader of Midian, their sister who was struck on the day of the plague because of the matter of Peor.” 1 And it happened after the plague, Yahweh said to Moses and to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, saying, 2 “Take a census of the community of the Israelites from those twenty years old and above, according to their families, all who are able to go out to war in Israel.” 3 So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them on the desert-plateau of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, saying, 4 “Take a census of the community from those twenty years old and above, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.” The Israelites who went out from the land of Egypt were: 5 Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, the descendants of Reuben: of Hanoch, the clan of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the clan of the Palluites; 6 of Hezron, the clan of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the clan of the Carmites. 7 These are the clans of the Reubenites, and the ones counted of them were forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty. 8 The children of Pallu: Eliab. 9 The children of Eliab: Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the same Dathan and Abiram who were appointed of the community, who rebelled against Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah, when they rebelled against Yahweh, 10 and the land opened its mouth and swallowed them with Korah, when that company died, when the fire consumed two hundred and fifty men, and they were a sign. 11 The children of Korah, however, did not die. 12 The descendants of Simeon, according to their clans: of Nemuel, the clan of the Nemuelites; of Jamin, the clan of the Jaminites; of Jakin, the clan of the Jakinites; 13 of Zerah, the clan of the Zerahites; of Shaul, the clan of the Shaulites. 14 These were the clans of the Simeonites, twenty-two thousand two hundred. 15 The descendants of Gad according to their clans: of Zephon, the clan of the Zephonites; of Haggi, the clan of the Haggites; of Shuni, the clan of the Shunites; 16 of Ozni, the clan of the Oznites; of Eri, the clan of the Erites; 17 of Arod, the clan of the Arodites; of Areli, the clan of the Arelites; 18 These were the clans of the descendants of Gad according to the ones counted of them, forty thousand five hundred. 19 The sons of Judah: Er and Onan; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. 20 The descendants of Judah according to their clans were: of Shelah, the clan of the Shelanites; of Perez, the clan of the Perezites; of Zerah, the clan of the Zerahites. 21 The children of Perez were: of Hezron, the clan of the Hezronites; of Hamul, the clan of the Hamulites. 22 These were the clans of Judah according to the ones counted of them, seventy-six thousand five hundred. 23 The descendants of Issachar according to their clans: of Tola, the clan of the Tolaites; of Puvah, the clan of the Punites; 24 of Jashub, the clans of the Jashubites; of Shimron, the clan of the Shimronites. 25 These were the clans of Issachar according to the ones counted of them, sixty-four thousand three hundred. 26 The descendants of Zebulun according to their clans: of Sered, the clan of the Seredites; of Elon, the clan of the Elonites; of Jahleel, the clan of the Jahleelites. 27 These were the clans of the Zebulunites according to the ones counted of them, sixty thousand five hundred. 28 The descendants of Joseph according to their clans: Manasseh and Ephraim. 29 The descendants of Manasseh: of Makir, the clan of the Makirites. And Makir fathered Gilead; of Gilead, the clan of the Gileadites. 30 These were the descendants of Gilead: of Iezer, the clan of the Iezerites; of Helek, the clan of the Helekites; 31 and of Asriel, the clan of the Asrielites; and of Shechem, the clan of the Shechemites; 32 and of Shemida, the clan of the Shemidaites; and of Hepher, the clan of the Hepherites. 33 Zelophehad son of Hepher did not have sons, but only daughters; and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 34 These were the clans of Manasseh, and the ones counted of them were fifty-two thousand seven hundred. 35 These were the descendants of Ephraim according to their clans: of Shuthelah, the clan of the Shuthelahites; of Beker, the clan of the Bekerites; of Tahan, the clan of the Tahanites. 36 And these were the descendants of Shuthelah: of Eran, the family of the Eranites. 37 These were the clans of the descendants of Ephraim according to the ones counted of them, thirty-two thousand five hundred. These were the descendants of Joseph according to their clans. 38 The descendants of Benjamin according to their clans: of Bela, the clan of the Belaites; of Ashbel, the clan of the Ashbelites; of Ahiram, the clan of the Ahiramites; 39 of Shephupham, the clan of the Shuphamites; of Hupham, the clan of the Huphamites. 40 The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: of Ard, the clan of the Ardites; of Naaman, the clan of the Naamites. 41 These were the descendants of Benjamin according to their clans. And the ones counted of them were forty-five thousand six hundred. 42 These were the descendants of Dan according to their clans: of Shuham, the clan of the Shuhamites. These were the clans of Dan according to their clans. 43 All the clans of the Shuhamites, according to the ones counted of them, were sixty-four thousand four hundred. 44 The descendants of Asher according to their clans: of Imnah, the clan of the Imnahites; of Ishvi, the clan of the Ishvites; of Beriah, the clan of the Beriahites. 45 The descendants of Beriah: of Heber, the clan of the Heberites; of Malkiel, the clan of the Malkielites. 46 The name of the daughter of Asher was Serah. 47 These were the clans of the descendants of Asher according to the ones counted of them, fifty-three thousand four hundred. 48 The descendants of Naphtali according to their clans: of Jahzeel, the clan of the Jahzeelites; of Guni, the clan of the Gunites; 49 of Jezer, the clan of the Jezerites; of Shillem, the clan of the Shillemites. 50 These were the clans of Naphtali according to their clans, the ones counted of them, forty-five thousand four hundred. 51 These were the ones counted of the Israelites, six hundred and one thousand seven hundred and thirty. 52 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 53 “For these the land must be divided as an inheritance according to the number of names. 54 For the larger group you must increase their inheritance, and for the smaller group you must make smaller their inheritance; each must be given their inheritance according to the number of the ones counted of them. 55 Surely the land will be divided by lot. They will inherit according to the names of the tribes of their ancestors. 56 Their inheritance must be divided according to the lot between the larger and smaller groups.” 57 These are the ones counted of the Levites according to their clans: of Gershon, the clan of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the clan of the Kohathites; of Merari, the clan of the Merarites. 58 These are the clans of Levi: the clan of the Libnites, the clan of the Hebronites, the clan of the Mahlites, the clan of the Mushites, the clan of the Korahites. Kohath fathered Amram. 59 The name of the wife of Amram was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whose mother bore her for Levi in Egypt; she bore to Amram: Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam. 60 To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 61 But Nadab and Abihu died when they presented strange fire before Yahweh. 62 The ones counted were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and above, because they were not counted in the midst of the Israelites since no inheritance was given to them in the midst of the Israelites. 63 These were the ones counted by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who counted the Israelites on the desert-plateau of Moab on the Jordan across Jericho. 64 And among these there was not a man of those counted by Moses and Aaron the priest, who counted the Israelites in the desert of Sinai. 65 For Yahweh said to them, “They will surely die in the desert.” And not a man was left over from them, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.

Numbers,"1 Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, of the clan of Manasseh the son of Joseph, came near; and these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, and Tirzah. 2 They stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the leaders of the entire community at the doorway of the tent of assembly, saying, 3 “Our father died in the desert; he was not in the midst of the company of those who banded together against Yahweh in the company of Korah, but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons. 4 Why should the name of our father disappear from the midst of his clan because he does not have a son? Give us property in the midst of the brothers of our father.” 5 So Moses brought their case before Yahweh. 6 And Yahweh said to Moses, saying, 7 “The statements of the daughters of Zelophehad are right. You must surely give them the property of an inheritance in the midst of their father’s brothers, and you must transfer the inheritance of their father to them. 8 And you must speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘If a man dies and has no son, you must transfer his inheritance to his daughter. 9 And if he has no daughter, you must give his inheritance to his brothers. 10 If he has no brothers, then you must give his inheritance to his father’s brothers. 11 If his father has no brothers, then you must give his inheritance to his nearest relative from his own clan, and he will take possession of it. It will be as a decree of stipulation for the Israelites, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.’ ” 12 Yahweh said to Moses, “Go up to this mountain of Abarim, and see the land that I have given to the Israelites. 13 When you see it, you will be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother was gathered, 14 because you rebelled against my word in the desert of Zin when the community quarreled regarding my holiness at the waters.” (These are the waters of Meribah-Kadesh in the desert of Zin.) 15 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 16 “Let Yahweh, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the community 17 who will go out before them and will come in before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in, so the community of Yahweh will not be like a flock that does not have a shepherd.” 18 Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and place your hand on him. 19 Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before the entire community, and commission him in their sight. 20 You will give to him from your authority so that the entire community of Israel will obey him. 21 He will stand before Eleazar the priest, who will ask for him by the decision of the Urim before Yahweh. On his command they will go out, and at his command they will come in, both he and all of the Israelites with him, the entire community.” 22 Moses did just as Yahweh commanded him, and he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before the entire community. 23 And he placed his hands on him and commissioned him just as Yahweh spoke by the hand of Moses. 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Command the Israelites and say to them, ‘You will be careful to present my offering, my food of my offerings made by fire, of a fragrance of appeasement to me, at its appointed time.’ ",Numbers 27:1-28:2,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/numbers-271282-256082/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-02-24_numbers-271282_20120125170058.mp3
Numbers,"3 You will say to them, ‘This is the offering made by fire that you will offer to Yahweh: two male lambs without defect in their first year as a continual burnt offering each day. 4 You will offer one male lamb in the morning, and the second male lamb you will offer at twilight, 5 and a tenth of an ephah of finely milled flour as a grain offering, mixed with a fourth of a measure of beaten oil. 6 It is a continual burnt offering that was ordained on Mount Sinai as a fragrance of appeasement, an offering made by fire for Yahweh. 7 The libation with it will be a fourth of a liquid measure for each male lamb; in the sanctuary you will pour out the libation of fermented drink for Yahweh. 8 And the second male lamb you will offer at twilight; as the grain offering of the morning and as its libation you will offer it, an offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh. 9 “ ‘On the day of the Sabbath, two male lambs without defect in their first year, and two-tenths of finely milled flour mixed with oil for a grain offering and its libation. 10 This is the burnt offering every Sabbath in addition to the continual burnt offering and its libation. 11 “ ‘And at the beginning of each of your months, you will present a burnt offering for Yahweh: two bulls and one ram, seven male lambs without defect in their first year; 12 and three-tenths of finely milled flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, for each bull; and two-tenths of finely milled flour mixed with oil for a grain offering for the one ram; 13 and a tenth of finely milled flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each male lamb, for a burnt offering of a fragrance of appeasement, an offering of fire for Yahweh. 14 Their libations will be half a liquid measure of wine for the bull and a third of a liquid measure of wine for the ram and a fourth of a liquid measure of wine for the male lamb; this is the burnt offering for every month for the months of the year. 15 And one male goat as a sin offering for Yahweh; it will be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering and its libation. 16 “ ‘On the fourteenth day of the first month is the Passover for Yahweh. 17 On the fifteenth day of this month is a religious feast, unleavened bread must be eaten for seven days. 18 On the first day there will be a holy convocation; you will not do any regular work. 19 You will present an offering by fire, a burnt offering for Yahweh: two bulls and one ram and seven male lambs in their first year; they will be for you without defect. 20 For their grain offering, you will offer finely milled flour mixed with oil: three-tenths for the bull and two-tenths for the ram. 21 You will offer a tenth for each of the seven male lambs; 22 and a goat for one sin offering to make atonement for you. 23 You will offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for the continual burnt offering. 24 Like this you will offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh; it will be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering and its libation. 25 On the seventh day you will have a holy convocation; you will not do any regular work. 26 “ ‘And on the day of firstfruits, when you are presenting a new offering for Yahweh during your Festival of Weeks, you will have a holy convocation; you will not do any regular work. 27 You will present a burnt offering for a fragrance of appeasement for Yahweh: two bulls, one ram, seven male lambs in their first year; 28 and their grain offering will be finely milled flour mixed with oil: three-tenths for each bull, two-tenths for one ram, 29 a tenth for each of the male lambs; 30 and one male goat to make atonement for you. 31 In addition to the continual burnt offering and its grain offering, you will offer them without defect with their libation. 1 “ ‘On the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you will have a holy convocation; you will not do any regular work.

4 and one-tenth for each of the seven male lambs; 5 with one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you, 6 in addition to the burnt offering of the new moon and its grain offering, the continual burnt offering and its grain offering, and their libations, according to their stipulations, as a fragrance of appeasement by fire for Yahweh. 7 “ ‘And on the tenth of this seventh month you will have a holy convocation, and you will afflict yourselves;

he must do all that went out from his mouth. 3 “If a woman makes a vow to Yahweh, and she binds a pledge on herself in her father’s house in your childhood, 4 but if her father hears her vow or her pledge that she bound on herself and says nothing to her, then all her vows will stand, and every pledge that she binds on her life will stand. 5 If her father forbids her on the day he hears of it, all her vows or her pledges that she bound on herself will not stand, and Yahweh will forgive her because her father has forgiven her. 6 “If she has a husband while bound by her vows or a rash promise of her lips, 7 and her husband hears of it and is silent on the day he hears it, her vows will stand, and her pledge that she bound upon herself will stand. 8 But if on the day her husband hears of it, he forbids her, then he will nullify her vow that she is under, and the rash promise of her lips that she bound on herself; and Yahweh will forgive her. 9 “But the vow of a widow or a woman who is divorced, all that she binds on herself will stand on her. 10 But if she made a vow in her husband’s house, or bound herself on a pledge with a sworn oath, 11 and her husband heard it but was silent to her, and he did not forbid her, all her vows will stand and every pledge that she bound on herself will stand. 12 But if her husband nullified them on the day he hears them, all her vows going out of her lips concerning her vows or the pledge on herself will not stand; her husband has nullified them, and Yahweh will forgive her. 13 “Any vow and any sworn oath of a pledge to inflict on herself, her husband can confirm it or her husband can nullify it. 14 But if her husband is completely silent from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or all her pledges that are on her; he confirms them because he was silent to her on the day he heard them. 15 But if he indeed nullifies them after he hears them, then he will bear her guilt.” 16 These are the decrees that Yahweh commanded Moses, as between a husband and his wife, and between a father and his daughter, while her childhood is in her father’s house.

Numbers,"1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Seek vengeance for the Israelites on the Midianites; afterward you will be gathered to your people.” 3 Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm yourself from among your men for the battle, so that they will go against Midian to mete out the vengeance of Yahweh on Midian. 4 A thousand from each tribe of every tribe of Israel you will send to battle.” 5 So theywere assigned from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand equipped for battle. 6 Moses sent them, a thousand from each tribe, to the battle, and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the battle with them, and the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets of the blast were in his hand. 7 And they fought against Midian just as Yahweh commanded Moses, and they killed every male. 8 They killed the kings of Midian in addition to the ones they had slain: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; they also killed Balaam son of Beor by the sword. 9 The Israelites took captive the women of Midian and their children, and they plundered all their domestic animals and all their livestock and all their wealth. 10 They burned all their cities where they dwelled and all their camps with fire. 11 They took all the plunder and all the war-booty with the humans and domestic animals. 12 They brought the captives, the war-booty, and the plunder to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the community of the Israelites, to the camp to the desert-plateau of Moab, which was on the Jordan across Jericho. 13 And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went out to meet them outside the camp. 14 But Moses was angry toward the leaders of the troops, the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, who came from the battle of the war. 15 And Moses said to them, “You have kept alive every female? 16 Behold, these women caused the Israelites, by the word of Balaam, to be in apostasy against Yahweh in the matter of Peor, so that the plague was among the community of Yahweh. 17 Now kill every male among the little children, and kill every woman who has had sexual intercourse with a man. 18 But all the females who have not had sexual intercourse with a man, keep alive for yourselves. 19 And you, camp outside the camp seven days; all who killed a person and all who touched the slain purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives. 20 You will purify yourselves and every garment and every object of hide and all the work of goats’ hair, and every object of wood.” 21 Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of the battle who came from the war, “This is the decree of the law that Yahweh commanded Moses. 22 Only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead—23 everything that will go through the fire—you will pass through the fire, and it will be clean, and only in waters of impurity will it be purified. Whatever does not go into the fire you will pass through the waters. 24 And you will wash your garments on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you will come into the camp.” 25 Yahweh said to Moses, saying, 26 “You and Eleazar the priest and the leaders of the families of the community, take count of the war-booty that was captured, both humans and the domestic animals; 27 divide the war-booty between those who engaged in the war, who went out to the battle, and all the community. 28 Exact a tribute for Yahweh from the men of the war, those who went out to the battle, one from five hundred persons, and from the cattle and from the male donkeys and from the flock; 29 take from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a contribution to Yahweh. 30 From half of the Israelites, take one share drawn by lot from the fifty from the humans, from the cattle, from the male donkeys, from the flock, from all the domestic animals, and give them to the Levities who keep the responsibilities of the tabernacle of Yahweh.” 31 Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 32 Thus the war-booty that remained of the plunder that the people of the battle plundered was six hundred and seventy-five thousand flocks of sheep, 33 seventy-two thousand cattle, 34 sixty-one thousand male donkeys, 35 and the life of humankind, from the women who did not have sexual intercourse with a man, all the persons were thirty-two thousand. 36 The half of the share that was going out to the battle: the number of the flock of sheep was thee hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred; 37 the tribute to Yahweh from the flock was six hundred and seventy-five; 38 and the cattle were thirty-six thousand; and the tribute to Yahweh was seventy-two. 39 Of the male donkeys there were thirty thousand five hundred, and the tribute to Yahweh was sixty-one; 40 the humans were sixteen thousand, and the tribute to Yahweh was thirty-two persons. 41 And Moses gave away the tribute of the contribution of Yahweh to Eleazar the priest, just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 42 From the half of the Israelites, which Moses divided from the men who were fighting, 43 the half that belonged to the community was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred from the flock, 44 and thirty-six thousand cattle, 45 and thirty thousand five hundred male donkeys, 46 and sixteen thousand humans. 47 From the half that belonged to the Israelites, Moses took one share drawn by lot out of every fifty humans and domestic animals, and he gave them to the Levites, who keep the responsibility of the tabernacle of Yahweh, just as Yahweh commanded Moses. 48 Then the leaders of the thousands of the army, the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, approached Moses, 49 and they said to Moses, “Your servants have taken count of the men of war who were in our charge, and no man is missing from us. 50 So we brought the offering of Yahweh, what each man found, objects of gold, bangles, bracelets, rings, earrings, and female ornaments, to make atonement for ourselves before Yahweh.” 51 Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all objects of work. 52 All the gold of the contribution that they raised up to Yahweh, from the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. 53 The men of battle plundered each for himself. 54 So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the commanders of the thousands and hundreds, and they brought it to the tent of the assembly as a memorial for the Israelites before Yahweh. 1 The descendants of Reuben and the descendants of Gad had a very large number of livestock. And they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold it was a place for livestock. 2 The descendants of Gad and the descendants of Reuben came, and they said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, saying, 3 “Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, 4 the land that Yahweh struck before the community of Israel, is a land of livestock, and your servants have livestock.” 5 They said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as property; do not lead us across the Jordan.” 6 But Moses said to the descendants of Gad and to the descendants of Reuben, “Will your brothers go to war while you yourselves live here? 7 Why are you discouraging the hearts of the Israelites from crossing into the land that Yahweh gave to them? 8 This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land. 9 When they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the Israelites so that they did not come to the land that Yahweh gave to them. 10 So Yahweh’s anger burned on that day, and he swore an oath, saying, 11 ‘The men who went up from Egypt, from those twenty years old and above, will not see the land that I swore with an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob because they have not wholly followed me, 12 except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, because they followed Yahweh wholly.’ 13 And Yahweh became angry, and he made them wander in the desert forty years until the entire generation who did evil in the sight of Yahweh had died. 14 Behold, you stand in the place of your fathers, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more Yahweh’s fierce anger against Israel. 15 If you turn from following him, he will again abandon them in the wilderness, and you would have destroyed all these people.” 16 They came near to him and said, “We will build sheep pens here for the flock of our livestock and cities for our little children; 17 but we ourselves will become armed and ready before the Israelites until we have brought them to their place, and our little children will live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 18 We will not return to our houses until the Israelites each obtain their inheritance for themselves. 19 For we will not take possession with them from across the Jordan and beyond because our inheritance has come to us from across the Jordan to the east.” 20 So Moses said to them, “If you do this thing, if you arm yourselves before Yahweh for the war, 21 and everyone of you armed cross the Jordan before Yahweh until he has driven out his enemies from before him, 22 and the land is subdued before Yahweh, then afterward you will return and be free of obligation from Yahweh and from Israel, and this land will be your property before Yahweh. 23 But if you do not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh, and know that your sin will find you. 24 Build for yourselves cities for your little children and sheep pens for your flocks; what has gone out from your mouth you will do.” 25 So the descendants of Gad and the descendants of Reuben said to Moses, saying, “Your servants will do just as my lord commands. 26 Our little children, our wives, our livestock, and all of our animals will remain in the cities of Gilead, 27 but your servants, everyone who is armed for battle, will cross over before Yahweh to the war, just as my lord says.” 28 So Moses commanded them, Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the tribes of the Israelites. 29 Moses said to them, “If the descendants of Gad and the descendants of Reuben, everyone who is armed for the war, cross over the Jordan before Yahweh, and the land is subdued before you, you will give them the land of Gilead as property. 30 But if they will not cross over with you armed, they will acquire land in your midst in Canaan.” 31 The descendants of Gad and the descendants of Reuben answered and said, “What Yahweh has commanded your servants, we will do. 32 We ourselves will cross over armed before Yahweh to the land of Canaan, and the property of our inheritance will remain with us beyond the Jordan.” 33 So Moses gave to them, to the descendants of Gad and the descendants of Reuben, and to half of the tribe of Joseph’s son Manasseh, the kingdom of Sihon the king of Amorites and the kingdom of Og the king of the Bashan, the land with its cities and their territories, the cities of the surrounding land. 34 The descendants of Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, and Aroer, 35 and Atroth Shophan, Jazer, and Jogbehah, 36 and Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran, the cities of Mibzar, and the sheep pens for flocks. 37 The descendants of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, and Kiriathaim, 38 and Nebo, Baal Meon (their names were changed), and Sibmah, and they renamed the cities that they rebuilt. 39 The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and they captured it and drove out the Amorites who were in it. 40 So Moses gave Gilead to Makir son of Manasseh, and he lived in it. 41 And Jair son of Manasseh went and captured their unwalled villages, and he called them Havvoth Jair. 42 Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and he called it Nobah after his own name. 1 These were the journeys of the Israelites, who went out from the land of Egypt according to their divisions, by the hand of Moses and Aaron. 2 Moses wrote down their movements according to their journeys on the command of Yahweh, and these are their journeys according to their movements. 3 They set out from Rameses on the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover the Israelites went out boldly in the sight of all the Egyptians 4 while the Egyptians were burying all the firstborn among them whom Yahweh struck. Yahweh also executed punishments among their gods. 5 Then the Israelites set out from Rameses, and they camped in Succoth. 6 They journeyed from Succoth and camped in Etham, which is on the edge of the desert. 7 Then they set out from Etham and returned to Pi-Hahiroth, which faces Baal Zephon, and they camped before Migdol. 8 They set out from Pi-Hahiroth and went through the midst of the sea into the desert; and they went a journey of three days into the desert of Etham and camped at Marah. 9 They set out from Marah and came to Elim, and in Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there. 10 They set out from Elim, and they camped at the Red Sea. 11 They set out from the Red Sea and camped at the desert of Sin. 12 They set out from the desert of Sin and camped at Dophkah. 13 They set out from Dophkah and camped at Alush. 14 They set out from Alush and encamped at Rephidim; and it was there that the people had no water to drink. 15 They set out from Rephidim and camped in the desert of Sinai. 16 The set out from the desert of Sinai and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah. 17 They set out from Kibroth Hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth. 18 They set out from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah. 19 They set out from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon Perez. 20 They set out from Rimmon Perez and camped at Libnah. 21 They set out from Libnah and camped at Rissah. 22 They set out from Rissah and camped at Kehelathah. 23 They set out from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shapher. 24 They set out from Mount Shapher and camped at Haradah. 25 They set out from Haradah and camped at Makheloth. 26 They set out from Makheloth and camped at Tahath. 27 They set out from Tahath and camped at Terah. 28 They set out from Terah and camped at Mithcah. 29 They set out from Mithcah and camped at Hashmonah. 30 They set out from Hashmonah and camped at Moserah. 31 They set out from Moserah and camped at Bene-Jaakan. 32 They set out from Bene-Jaakan and camped at Hor Haggidgad. 33 They set out from Hor Haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah. 34 They set out from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah. 35 They set out from Abronah and camped at Ezion Geber. 36 They set out from Ezion Geber and camped in the desert of Zin, that is, Kadesh. 37 They set out from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, at the edge of the land of Edom. 38 Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the command of Yahweh, and he died there in the fortieth year after the Israelites had gone out from the land of Egypt, in the fifth month on the first day of the month. 39 Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor. 40 Now the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who was living in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the Israelites. 41 Then they set out from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah. 42 They set out from Zalmonah and camped at Punon. 43 They set out from Punon and camped at Oboth. 44 They set out from Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim, the boundary of Moab. 45 They set out from Iyim and camped at Dibon Gad. 46 They set out from Dibon Gad and camped at Almon-Diblatayim. 47 They set out from Almon-Diblatayim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo. 48 They set out from the mountains of Abarim and camped on the desert-plateau of Moab by the Jordan across Jericho. 49 They camped by the Jordan, from Beth-Jeshimoth up to Abel Shittim, on the desert-plateau of Moab. 50 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses on the desert-plateau of Moab by the Jordan across Jericho, saying, 51 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 52 you will drive out the inhabitants of the land from your presence, and you will destroy all their idols and all the images of their molten idols, and you will demolish all their high places; 53 you will dispossess the land and live in it because I have given the land to you to possess it. 54 You will distribute the land by lot according to your clans; to the larger group you will give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller group you will give less inheritance. However the lot falls for him, there the lot will be. You will distribute it according to the tribes of your ancestors. 55 But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from your presence, then it will happen that whomever you let remain of them will be like irritants in your eyes and like thorns in your sides; they will be your enemies in the land in which you live. 56 And just as I planned to do to them, I will do to you.’ ” 1 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Command the Israelites and say to them, ‘When you come into the land of Canaan, this is the land that was allotted to you as an inheritance, the land of Canaan according to its boundaries. 3 Your southern edge will be from the desert of Zin toward the side of Edom, and your southern border will be from the end of the Salt Sea to the east; 4 your boundary will turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim and will pass over to Zin, and its limits will be from the south of Kadesh Barnea; it will continue to Hazar Addar and pass over to Azmon. 5 The boundary will turn from Azmon to the valley of Egypt, and its limits will be to the sea. 6 “ ‘Your western boundary will be the Great Sea; this will be your western boundary. 7 Your northern border will be from the Great Sea; you will make a boundary from the Great Sea to Mount Hor. 8 From Mount Hor you will make a boundary to reach Hamath; the limits of the territory will be at Zedad. 9 The boundary will go out to Ziphron, and its limits will be at Hazar Enan. This will be your boundary to the north. 10 “ ‘You will mark out your eastern boundary from Hazar Enan to Shepham; 11 the boundary will go down from Shepham to Riblah from the east side of Ain, and the boundary will go down and border on the eastern side of the Sea of Kinnereth. 12 The boundary will go down to the Jordan, and its limits will be at the Salt Sea. This will be your land according to its boundaries all around.’ ” 13 So Moses commanded the Israelites, saying, “This is the land that you will obtain as an inheritance for yourself by lot, which Yahweh commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes. 14 For the tribe of the children of the Reubenites, the children of the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh took their inheritance according to the house of their families. 15 The two and a half tribes have taken their inheritance from beyond the Jordan across Jericho, east toward the sunrise.” 16 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 17 “These are the names of the men who divide up the land for your inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun. 18 You will take one leader from every tribe to divide up the land for inheritance. 19 These are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; 20 of the tribe of the descendants of Simeon, Samuel son of Ammihud; 21 of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon; 22 of the tribe of the descendants of Dan, the leader Bukki son of Jogli; 23 of the descendants of Joseph, the tribe of the descendants of Manasseh, the leader Hanniel son of Ephod. 24 Of the tribe of the descendants of Ephraim, the leader Kemuel son of Shiphtan; 25 of the tribe of the descendants of Zebulum, the leader Elizaphan son of Parnach; 26 of the tribe of the descendants of Issachar, the leader Paltiel son of Azzan; 27 of the tribe of the descendants of Asher, the leader Ahihud son of Shelomi; 28 of the tribe of the descendants of Naphtali, the leader Pedahel son of Ammihud.” 29 These are those whom Yahweh commanded to allot to the Israelites the land of Canaan. 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses on the desert plains of Moab beyond the Jordan across Jericho, saying, 2 “Command the Israelites that they give to the Levites from the inheritance of their property cities to live in; and you will give to the Levites pastureland all around the cities. 3 The cities will be theirs to live in, and their pasturelands will be for their domestic animals, for their possessions, and their animals. 4 “The pasturelands of the cities that you will give to the Levites will extend from the wall of the city to a distance of a thousand cubits all around. 5 You will measure outside the city the eastern edge two thousand cubits, for the southern edge two thousand cubits, for the western edge two thousand cubits, and for the northern edge two thousand cubits, with the city in the middle; this will be for them the pasturelands of the cities. 6 “All the cities that you will give the Levites will be six cities of refuge, to which the killer can flee; in addition to them you will give forty-two cities. 7 All the cities that you will give to the Levites will be forty-eight cities, them with their pasturelands. 8 And the cities that you will give from the property of the Israelites, you will take more from the larger group and less from the smaller group; each of them will give according to the portion of their inheritance according to the portion that he inherits.” 9 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 10 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 11 you will select for yourselves cities for your cities of refuge, that a killer who has killed a person unintentionally can flee there. 12 The cities will be to you a refuge from a redeemer, so that the killer will not die until he stands before the community for judgment. 13 The cities that you are to give will be your six cities of refuge. 14 You will give three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan; they will be cities of refuge. 15 To the Israelites, to the alien, and to the temporary resident in their midst there will be these six cities as a refuge to which anyone who unintentionally kills a person may flee. 16 “ ‘But if he hit him with an object of iron, so that he dies, the killer must surely be put to death. 17 And if he hit him with a stone in the hand, by which he will die, and he does die, he is a killer; the killer must surely be put to death. 18 Or if he hit him with a wooden object, by which he will die, and he does die, he is a killer; the killer must surely be put to death. 19 The blood avenger himself will put the killer to death; he must put him to death when meeting him. 20 If he shoves him in hatred, or he throws something at him with intention, and he dies, 21 or if he hits him in hostility with his hand, and he dies, the one that struck him will put to death the killer when meeting him. 22 “ ‘Or if in an instant he shoved him, not in hostility, or threw something at him without intention, 23 or with any stone, without seeing it dropped on him so that he dies, while he was not seeking his injury, 24 then the community will judge between the striker and between the blood avenger according to these ordinances. 25 The community will deliver the killer from the hand of the blood avenger, and the community will restore him to the city of his refuge to which he fled; and he will live there in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with holy oil. 26 But if the killer surely goes out of the territory of the city of his refuge to which he fled, 27 and the blood avenger finds him outside the territory of the city of his refuge, and the blood avenger kills the killer, he will not be guilty of blood 28 because he must live in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the killer will return to the land of his property. 29 These things will be as a decree of justice for you for your generations in all your dwellings. 30 “ ‘If anyone kills a person, the killer will be put to death according to the testimony of witnesses, but someone cannot die on testimony of one person. 31 Also, you will not take a ransom payment for the life of a killer who is guilty of death; indeed, he must surely be put to death. 32 You will not take a ransom payment for the one that flees to the city of his refuge, so that he may return to live in the land before the death of the priest. 33 So you will not pollute the land in which you are; because blood pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is poured out on it except with the blood of the one who poured it out. 34 You will not defile the land on which you are living because I am living in the midst of it; I am Yahweh; I am living in the midst of the Israelites.’ ” 1 The leaders of the families of the clans of descendants of Gilead the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, of the clans of the descendants of Joseph came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders of the families of the Israelites. 2 And they said, “Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land by lot as an inheritance to the Israelites, and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters. 3 But if they become wives to one of the sons from another tribe of the Israelites, their inheritance will disappear from the inheritance of our ancestors, and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; the lot of our inheritance would disappear. 4 When the Jubilee of the Israelites comes, it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; and their inheritance will disappear from the tribe of our father.” 5 Then Moses commanded the Israelites by the command of Yahweh, saying, “The tribe of the descendants of Joseph is right regarding what they are speaking. 6 This is the word that Yahweh commanded the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘Let them marry whomever they like; only they must marry from within the clan of the tribe of their father. 7 Thus an inheritance of the Israelites will not go around from tribe to tribe. Rather, the inheritance of each tribe of his father will remain with the Israelites. 8 Every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the tribes of the Israelites will marry one of the clan of the tribe of her father, so that the Israelites will possess the inheritance of his ancestors. 9 Therefore an inheritance will not go around from one tribe to another tribe because the tribes of the Israelites will each hold to their own inheritance.’ ” 10 Just as Yahweh commanded to Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did: 11 Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married the sons of their uncles. 12 They married those from the sons of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained among the tribe of the clan of their ancestors. 13 These were the commands and the stipulations that Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses to the Israelites on the desert-plateaus of Moab by the Jordan across Jericho.

Luke,"5 It happened that in the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest, Zechariah by name, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. 6 And they were both righteous in the sight of God, living blamelessly in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord. 7 And they did not have a child, because Elizabeth was barren. And they were both advanced in years. 8 And it happened that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division, 9 according to the custom of the priesthood he was chosen by lot to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense. 10 And the whole crowd of the people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering. 11 And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 12 And Zechariah was terrified when he saw the angel, and fear fell upon him. 13 But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will call his name John. 14 And you will experience joy and exultation, and many will rejoice at his birth. 15 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he must never drink wine or beer, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit while he is still in his mother’s womb. 16 And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God. 17 And he will go on before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to prepare for the Lord a people made ready.” 18 And Zechariah said to the angel, “By what will I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years!” 19 And the angel answered and said to him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to announce to you this good news. 20 And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.” 21 And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and began to wonder when he was delayed in the temple. 22 And when he came out he was not able to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them, and remained unable to speak. 23 And it happened that when the days of his service came to an end, he went away to his home. 24 Now after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying, 25 “Thus the Lord has done for me in the days in which he has concerned himself with me, to take away my disgrace among people.” 26 Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee named Nazareth, 27 to a virgin legally promised in marriage to a man named Joseph of the house of David. And the name of the virgin was Mary. 28 And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” 29 But she was greatly perplexed at the statement, and was pondering what sort of greeting this might be. 30 And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 And behold, you will conceive in the womb and will give birth to a son, and you will call his name Jesus. 32 This one will be great, and he will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David. 33 And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end. 34 And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?” 35 And the angel answered and said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the one to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.

Luke,"36 And behold, your relative Elizabeth—she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren. 37 For nothing will be impossible with God.” 38 So Mary said, “Behold, the Lord’s female slave! May it happen to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her. 39 Now in those days Mary set out and traveled with haste into the hill country, to a town of Judah, 40 and entered into the house of Zechariah, and greeted Elizabeth. 41 And it happened that when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby in her womb leaped and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 42 And she cried out with a loud shout and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! 43 And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 44 For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy! 45 And blessed is she who believed that there will be a fulfillment to what was spoken to her from the Lord!” 46 And Mary said, “My soul exalts the Lord, 47 and my spirit has rejoiced greatly in God my Savior, 48 because he has looked upon the humble state of his female slave, for behold, from now on all generations will consider me blessed, 49 because the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name. 50 And his mercy is for generation after generation to those who fear him. 51 He has done a mighty deed with his arm; he has dispersed the proud in the thoughts of their hearts. 52 He has brought down rulers from their thrones, and has exalted the lowly. 53 He has filled those who are hungry with good things, and those who are rich he has sent away empty-handed. 54 He has helped Israel his servant, remembering his mercy, 55 just as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.” 56 And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her home. 57 Now the time came for Elizabeth that she should give birth, and she gave birth to a son. 58 And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. 59 And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were wanting to name him after his father Zechariah. 60 And his mother answered and said, “No, but he will be named John.” 61 And they said to her, “There is no one of your relatives who is called by this name.” 62 So they made signs to his father asking what he wanted him to be named, 63 and he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, saying, “John is his name.” And they were all astonished. 64 And his mouth and his tongue were opened immediately, and he began to speak, praising God. 65 And fear came on all those who lived near them, and in all the hill country of Judea all these events were discussed. 66 And all those who heard kept these things in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be? For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him!” 67 And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying, 68 “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited to help and has redeemed his people, 69 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, 70 just as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times— 71 salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those who hate us, 72 to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant, 73 the oath that he swore to Abraham our father, to grant us 74 that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, could serve him without fear 75 in holiness and righteousness before him all our days. 76 And so you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High, for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways, 77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins, 78 because of the merciful compassion of our God by which the dawn will visit to help us from on high, 79 to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace.” 80 And the child kept growing and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.

Luke,"1 Now it happened that in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the empire. 2 (This first registration took place when Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 3 And everyone went to be registered, each one to his own town. 4 So Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David, 5 to be registered together with Mary, who was legally promised in marriage to him and was pregnant. 6 And it happened that while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. 7 And she gave birth to her firstborn son, and wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn. 8 And there were shepherds in the same region, living out of doors and keeping watch, guarding over their flock by night. 9 And an angel of the Lord stood near them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terribly frightened. 10 And the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring good news to you of great joy which will be for all the people: 11 that today a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, was born for you in the city of David. 12 And this will be the sign for you: you will find the baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.” 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying, 14 “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among people with whom he is pleased!” 15 And it happened that when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds began to say to one another, “Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has revealed to us!” 16 And they went hurrying and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby who was lying in the manger. 17 And when they saw it, they made known the statement that had been told to them about this child. 18 And all who heard it were astonished concerning what had been said to them by the shepherds. 19 But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering them in her heart. 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them. 21 And when eight days were completed so that he could be circumcised, he was named Jesus, his name that he was called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. 22 And when the days of their purification were completed according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord 23 (just as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male that opens the womb will be called holy to the Lord”) 24 and to offer a sacrifice according to what was stated in the law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.” 25 And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. 26 And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he would see the Lord’s Christ. 27 And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus so that they could do for him according to what was customary under the law, 28 he took him in his arms and praised God and said, 29 “Now dismiss your slave in peace, Lord, according to your word. 30 For my eyes have seen your salvation ",Luke 2:1-30,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-21-30-242322/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2011-12-28_luke-21-30_20111129145906.mp3
Luke,"31 that you have prepared in the presence of all the peoples, 32 a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory to your people Israel.” 33 And his father and mother were astonished at what was said about him. 34 And Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, “Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed—35 and a sword will pierce your own soul also, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed!” 36 And there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher (she was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, 37 and herself as a widow up to eighty-four years) who did not depart from the temple with fastings and prayers, serving night and day. 38 And at that same hour she approached and began to give thanks to God, and to speak about him to all those who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem. 39 And when they had completed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. 40 And the child was growing and becoming strong, filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him. 41 And his parents went every year to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover. 42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the feast. 43 And after the days were completed, while they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. And his parents did not know it, 44 but believing him to be in the group of travelers, they went a day’s journey. And they began searching for him among their relatives and their acquaintances, 45 and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him. 46 And it happened that after three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them and asking them questions. 47 And all who heard him were amazed at his insight and his answers. 48 And when they saw him, they were astounded and his mother said to him, “Child, why have you done this to us? Look, your father and I have been searching for you anxiously!” 49 And he said to them, “Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that it was necessary for me to be in the house of my Father?” 50 And they did not understand the statement that he spoke to them. 51 And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was submitting to them. And his mother treasured all these things in her heart. 52 And Jesus was advancing in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and with people. 1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene, 2 in the time of the high priest Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness. 3 And he went into all the surrounding region of the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, 4 as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, “The voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight! 5 Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be leveled, and the crooked will become straight, and the rough road will become smooth, 6 and all flesh will see the salvation of God.’ ” 7 Therefore he was saying to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, “Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8 Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance! And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones!

Luke,"9 And even now the ax is positioned at the root of the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.” 10 And the crowds were asking him, saying, “What then should we do?” 11 And he answered and said to them, “The one who has two tunics must share with the one who does not have one, and the one who has food must do likewise.” 12 And tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?” 13 And he said to them, “Collect no more than what you are ordered to.” 14 And those who served in the army were also asking him, saying, “What should we also do?” And he said to them, “Extort from no one, and do not blackmail anyone, and be content with your pay.” 15 And while the people were waiting expectantly and all were pondering in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he might be the Christ, 16 John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but the one who is more powerful than I am is coming, of whom I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 17 His winnowing shovel is in his hand, to clean out his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” 18 So with many other exhortations also he proclaimed good news to the people. 19 But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him concerning Herodias, his brother’s wife, and concerning all the evil deeds that Herod had done, 20 added this also to them all: he also locked up John in prison. 21 Now it happened that when all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized, and while he was praying, heaven was opened, 22 and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.” 23 And Jesus, when he began his ministry, was himself about thirty years old, being the son (as it was believed) of Joseph the son of Eli, 24 the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, 25 the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, 26 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, 27 the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, 28 the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, 29 the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, 30 the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, 31 the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, 32 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Sala, the son of Nahshon, 33 the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, 34 the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, 35 the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, 36 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, 37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, 38 the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God. 1 And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness 2 forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days, and when they were completed, he was hungry. 3 So the devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, order this stone that it become bread!” 4 And Jesus replied to him, “It is written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone.’ ” 5 And he led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 6 And the devil said to him, “I will give you all this domain and their glory, because it has been handed over to me, and I can give it to whomever I want. 7 So if you will worship before me, all this will be yours.” 8 And Jesus answered and said to him, “It is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.’ ” 9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and had him stand on the highest point of the temple and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, 10 for it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you, to protect you,’ 11 and ‘on their hands they will lift you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’ ” 12 And Jesus answered and said to him, “It is said, ‘You are not to put to the test the Lord your God.’ ” 13 And when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until a favorable time.

Luke,"14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news about him went out throughout all the surrounding region. 15 And he began to teach in their synagogues, and was praised by all. 16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and according to his custom he entered into the synagogue on the day of the Sabbath and stood up to read. 17 And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him, and unrolling the scroll he found the place where it was written, 18 “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because of which he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send out in freedom those who are oppressed, 19 to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord.” 20 And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were looking intently at him. 21 And he began to say to them, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” 22 And they were all speaking well of him, and were astonished at the gracious words that were coming out of his mouth. And they were saying, “Is this man not the son of Joseph?” 23 And he said to them, “Doubtless you will tell me this parable: ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ Whatever we have heard that took place in Capernaum, do here in your hometown also!” 24 And he said, “Truly I say to you that no prophet is acceptable in his own hometown. 25 But in truth I say to you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut for three years and six months while a great famine took place over all the land. 26 And Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath in the region of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. 27 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was made clean except Naaman the Syrian.” 28 And all those in the synagogue were filled with anger when they heard these things. 29 And they stood up and forced him out of the town and brought him up to the edge of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff. 30 But he passed through their midst and went on his way. 31 And he came down to Capernaum, a town of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbath. 32 And they were astounded at his teaching, because he spoke with authority. 33 And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, 34 “Ha! Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” 35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!” And after throwing him down in their midst, the demon came out of him without hurting him at all. 36 And amazement came upon them all, and they began to talk with one another, saying, “What word is this? For he commands the unclean spirits with authority and power, and they come out!” 37 And news about him went out into every place of the surrounding region. 38 And after he set out from the synagogue, he went into Simon’s house. And Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a high fever, and they asked him on behalf of her. 39 And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she got up and began to serve them. 40 Now as the sun was setting, all who had those who were sick with various diseases brought them to him, and placing his hands on every one of them, he healed them. 41 And demons also were coming out of many, crying out and saying, “You are the Son of God!” And he rebuked them and did not permit them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. 42 And when it was day, he departed and went to an isolated place. And the crowds were seeking him, and came to him and were trying to prevent him from departing from them. 43 But he said to them, “It is necessary for me to proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because I was sent for this purpose.

Luke,"1 Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around him and hearing the word of God, he was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret, 2 and he saw two boats there beside the lake, but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets. 3 And he got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out from the land a little. And he sat down and began to teach the crowds from the boat. 4 And when he stopped speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.” 5 And Simon answered and said, “Master, although we worked hard through the whole night, we caught nothing. But at your word I will let down the nets.” 6 And when they did this, they caught a very large number of fish, and their nets began to tear. 7 And they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink. 8 And when he saw it, Simon Peter fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, Lord, because I am a sinful man!” 9 For amazement had seized him and all those who were with him at the catch of fish that they had caught, 10 and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were business partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid! From now on you will be catching people!” 11 And after they brought their boats to the land, they left everything and followed him. 12 And it happened that while he was in one of the towns, there was a man covered with leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, he fell down on his face and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you are able to make me clean.” 13 And extending his hand he touched him, saying, “I am willing; be clean.” And immediately the leprosy went away from him. 14 And he ordered him, “Tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest and bring the offering for your cleansing just as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. 15 But the report about him spread even more, and large crowds were gathering to hear him and to be healed of their illnesses. 16 But he himself was withdrawing in the wilderness and praying. 17 And it happened that on one of the days as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was there in order for him to heal. 18 And behold, men came carrying on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and place him before him. 19 And when they did not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the roof tiles with the stretcher into the midst of them, in front of Jesus. 20 And when he saw their faith, he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven you.” 21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?” 22 But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered and said to them, “Why are you reasoning in your hearts? 23 Which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’ 24 But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” he said to the one who was paralyzed, “I say to you, ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and go to your home.’ ” 25 And immediately he stood up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, and went away to his home, glorifying God. 26 And amazement seized them all, and they began to glorify God. And they were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen wonderful things today!” 27 And after these things, he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me!” 28 And leaving everything behind, he got up and began to follow him. 29 And Levi gave a great banquet for him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining for the meal with them. 30 And the Pharisees and their scribes began to complain to his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?” 31 And Jesus answered and said to them, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those who are sick. 32 I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.” 33 And they said to him, “The disciples of John fast often and make prayers—likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees—but yours are eating and drinking!” 34 So he said to them, “You are not able to make the bridegroom’s attendants fast as long as the bridegroom is with them, are you? 35 But days will come, and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.” 36 And he also told a parable to them: “No one tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. Otherwise, he will have torn the new also, and the old will not match the patch that is from the new. 37 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled and the wineskins will be destroyed. 38 But new wine must be put into new wineskins. 39 And no one after drinking old wine wants new, because he says, ‘The old is just fine!’ ” ",Luke 5,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-5-245603/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-03_luke-5_20111214130703.mp3
Luke,"1 Now it happened that on a Sabbath he went through the grain fields, and his disciples were picking and eating the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands. 2 But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath? 3 And Jesus answered and said to them, “Have you not read this, what David did when he and those who were with him were hungry—4 how he entered into the house of God and took the bread of the presentation, which it is not permitted to eat (except the priests alone), and ate it and gave it to those with him?” 5 And he said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” 6 Now it happened that on another Sabbath he entered into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there, and his right hand was withered. 7 So the scribes and the Pharisees were watching closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, in order that they could find a reason to accuse him. 8 But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand, “Get up and stand in the middle,” and he got up and stood there. 9 And Jesus said to them, “I ask you whether it is permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save a life or to destroy it?” 10 And after looking around at them all, he said to him, “Stretch out your hand,” and he did, and his hand was restored. 11 But they were filled with fury, and began discussing with one another what they might do to Jesus. 12 Now it happened that in these days he went away to the mountain to pray, and was spending the whole night in prayer to God. 13 And when day came, he summoned his disciples and chose from them twelve, whom he also named apostles: 14 Simon (whom he also named Peter) and his brother Andrew, and James, and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew, 15 and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, 16 and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. 17 And he came down with them and stood on a level place, and a large crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all of Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast district of Tyre and Sidon, 18 who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases, and those who were troubled by unclean spirits were cured. 19 And the whole crowd was seeking to touch him, because power was going out from him and healing them all. 20 And he lifted up his eyes to his disciples and said, “Blessed are the poor, because yours is the kingdom of God. 21 Blessed are those who are hungry now, because you will be satisfied. Blessed are those who weep now, Because you will laugh. 22 Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil on account of the Son of Man. 23 Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For their fathers used to do the same things to the prophets. 24 “But woe to you who are rich, because you have received your comfort. 25 Woe to you who are satisfied now, because you will be hungry. Woe, you who laugh now, because you will mourn and weep. 26 Woe whenever all people speak well of you, for their fathers used to do the same things to the false prophets. 27 “But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 28 bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. 29 To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also, and from the one who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic also. 30 Give to everyone who asks you, and from the one who takes away your things, do not ask for them back. 31 And just as you want people to do to you, do the same to them. 32 “And if you love those who love you, what kind of credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them! 33 And if you do good to those who do good to you, what kind of credit is that to you? Even the sinners do the same! 34 And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive back, what kind of credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, so that they may get back an equal amount! 35 But love your enemies, and do good, and lend expecting back nothing, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. 36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful! 37 “And do not judge, and you will never be judged. And do not condemn, and you will never be condemned. Pardon, and you will be pardoned. 38 Give, and it will be given to you, a good measure—pressed down, shaken, overflowing—they will pour out into your lap. For with the measure by which you measure out, it will be measured out to you in return.” 39 And he also told them a parable: “Surely a blind person cannot lead the blind, can he? Will they not both fall into a pit? 40 A disciple is not superior to his teacher, but everyone, when he is fully trained, will be like his teacher. 41 And why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the beam of wood that is in your own eye? 42 How are you able to say to your brother, “Brother, allow me to remove the speck that is in your eye,” while you yourself do not see the beam of wood in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the beam of wood from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brother’s eye! 43 “For there is no good tree that produces bad fruit, nor on the other hand a bad tree that produces good fruit, 44 for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorn plants, nor are grapes harvested from thorn bushes. 45 The good person out of the good treasury of his heart brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasury brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks. 46 “And why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I tell you? 47 “Everyone who comes to me and listens to my words and does them—I will show you what he is like: 48 he is like a man building a house, who dug and went down deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood came, the river burst against that house and was not able to shake it, because it had been built well. 49 But the one who hears my words and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation, which the river burst against, and immediately it collapsed—and the collapse of that house was great!” ",Luke 6,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-6-245604/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-04_luke-6_20111214130859.mp3
Luke,"1 After he had finished all his statements in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. 2 Now a certain centurion’s slave, who was esteemed by him, was sick and was about to die. 3 So when he heard about Jesus, he sent Jewish elders to him, asking him that he would come and cure his slave. 4 And when they came to Jesus, they began imploring him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy that you grant this for him, 5 because he loves our nation and he himself built the synagogue for us.” 6 So Jesus went with them. Now by this time he was not far away from the house, and the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy that you should come in under my roof. 7 For this reason neither did I consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and my slave must be healed. 8 For I also am a man placed under authority, who has soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another one, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.” 9 And when Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning around to the crowd that was following him, he said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith!” 10 And when they returned to the house, those who had been sent found the slave healthy. 11 And it happened that on the next day he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him. 12 And as he approached the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, his mother’s only son, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. 13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, “Do not weep!” 14 And he came up and touched the bier, and those who were carrying it stopped. And he said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!” 15 And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and he gave him to his mother. 16 And fear seized them all, and they began to glorify God, saying, “A great prophet has appeared among us!” and “God has visited to help his people!” 17 And this report about him went out in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region. 18 And his disciples reported to John about all these things. And summoning a certain two of his disciples, John 19 sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?” 20 And when the men came to him, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?’ ” 21 In that hour he healed many people of diseases and suffering and evil spirits, and he granted sight to many blind people. 22 And he answered and said to them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear; the dead are raised, the poor have good news announced to them. 23 And whoever is not offended by me is blessed.” 24 And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 25 But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are in splendid clothing and luxury are in the royal palaces. 26 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet! 27 It is this man about whom it is written: ‘Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’ 28 I tell you, there is no one greater among those born of women than John, but the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. 29 (And all the people, when they heard this—even the tax collectors—affirmed the righteousness of God, because they had been baptized with the baptism of John, 30 but the Pharisees and the legal experts rejected the purpose of God for themselves, because they had not been baptized by him.) 31 “To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like? 32 They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another, who say, ‘We played the flute for you and you did not dance; we sang a lament and you did not weep.’ 33 For John the Baptist has come not eating bread or drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’ 34 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a man who is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ 35 And wisdom is vindicated by all her children.” ",Luke 7:1-35,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-71-35-245605/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-05_luke-71-35_20111214130906.mp3
Luke,"36 Now one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he entered into the house of the Pharisee and reclined at the table. 37 And behold, a woman in the town who was a sinner, when she learned that he was dining in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of perfumed oil, 38 and standing behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and was wiping them with the hair of her head and was kissing his feet and anointing them with the perfumed oil. 39 Now when the Pharisee who invited him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.” 40 And Jesus answered and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he said, “Teacher, say it.” 41 “There were two debtors who owed a certain creditor. One owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty. 42 When they were not able to repay him, he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?” 43 Simon answered and said, “I suppose that it is the one to whom he forgave more.” And he said to him, “You have judged correctly.” 44 And turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house. You did not give me water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. 45 You did not give me a kiss, but from the time I entered, she has not stopped kissing my feet. 46 You did not anoint my head with olive oil, but she anointed my feet with perfumed oil. 47 For this reason I tell you, her sins—which were many—have been forgiven, for she loved much. But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little.” 48 And he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” 49 And those who were reclining at the table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” 50 And he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.” 1 And it happened that afterward also he was going about from one town and village to another preaching and proclaiming the good news concerning the kingdom of God, and the twelve were with him, 2 and some women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (who was called Magdalene), from whom seven demons had gone out, 3 and Joanna the wife of Chuza (Herod’s household manager), and Susanna, and many others who were helping to support them from their possessions. 4 And while a large crowd was gathering and they were going to him from town after town, he spoke by means of a parable: 5 “The sower went out to sow his seed, and while he was sowing, some seed fell on the side of the path and was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it. 6 And other seed fell on the rock, and when it came up, it withered, because it did not have moisture. 7 And other seed fell in the midst of the thorn plants, and the thorn plants grew up with it and choked it. 8 And other seed fell on the good soil, and when it came up, it produced a hundred times as much grain.” As he said these things, he called out, “The one who has ears to hear, let him hear!” 9 And his disciples asked him what this parable meant. 10 And he said, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest they are in parables, so that ‘Seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’ 11 Now the parable means this: the seed is the word of God, 12 and those beside the path are the ones who have heard. Then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved. 13 And those on the rock are those who receive the word with joy when they hear it, and these do not have enough root, who believe for a time and in a time of testing fall away. 14 And the seed that fell into the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear and as they go along are choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life, and they do not bear fruit to maturity. 15 But the seed on the good soil—these are the ones who, after hearing the word, hold fast to it with a noble and good heart, and bear fruit with patient endurance. 16 “And no one, after lighting a lamp, covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, so that those who come in can see the light. 17 For nothing is secret that will not become evident, and nothing hidden that will never be known and come to light. 18 Therefore consider how you listen, for whoever has, to him more will be given, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away from him.” 19 Now his mother and brothers came to him, and they were not able to meet with him because of the crowd. 20 And it was reported to him, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you.” 21 But he answered and said to them, “These are my mother and my brothers—the ones who hear the word of God and do it. 22 Now it happened that on one of the days both he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.” And they set sail, 23 and as they were sailing, he fell asleep. And a storm of wind came down on the lake, and they were being swamped and were in danger. 24 And they came and woke him up, saying, “Master, master! We are perishing!” So he got up and rebuked the wind and the billowing waves of water and they ceased, and it became calm. 25 And he said to them, “Where is your faith?” But they were afraid and were astonished, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him?” 26 And they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. 27 And as he got out on the land, a certain man from the town met him who had demons and for a considerable time had not worn clothes and did not live in a house, but among the tombs. 28 And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me!” 29 For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For it had seized him many times, and he was bound with chains and shackles and was guarded, and breaking the bonds he would be driven by the demon into the deserted places.) 30 So Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion,” because many demons had entered into him. 31 And they began imploring him that he would not order them to depart into the abyss. 32 Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding there on the hill, and they implored him that he would permit them to enter into those pigs. And he permitted them. 33 So the demons came out of the man and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed headlong down the steep slope into the lake and were drowned. 34 And when the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the town and in the countryside. 35 So they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting there clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus, and they were afraid. 36 And those who had seen it reported to them how the man who had been demon-possessed had been healed. 37 And all the people of the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, because they had been seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned. 38 And the man from who the demons had gone out was begging him to stay with him, but he sent him away, saying, 39 “Return to your home and tell all that God has done for you.” And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole town all that Jesus had done for him. 40 Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, because they were all waiting for him. 41 And behold, a man who was named Jairus came, and this man was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at the feet of Jesus and began imploring him to come to his house, 42 because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. Now as he was going, the crowds were pressing against him. 43 And a woman who was suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years (who, although she had spent all her assets on physicians, was not able to be healed by anyone) 44 came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her hemorrhaging stopped. 45 And Jesus said, “Who is the one who touched me?” And when they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds are pressing you hard and crowding you!” 46 But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, because I know power has gone out from me.” 47 And when the woman saw that she did not escape notice, she came trembling and falling down before him. In the presence of all the people, she told for what reason she had touched him, and that she was healed immediately. 48 And he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace.” 49 While he was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue ruler’s house, saying, “Your daughter is dead! Trouble the Teacher no longer!” 50 But Jesus, when he heard this, replied to him, “Do not be afraid! Only believe, and she will be healed.” 51 Now when he came to the house, he did not allow anyone to enter with him except Peter and John and James and the father and mother of the child. 52 And they were all weeping and mourning for her, but he said, “Do not weep! For she is not dead, but is sleeping.” 53 And they began laughing at him, because they knew that she was dead. 54 But he took her hand and called, saying, “Child, get up.” 55 And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately, and he ordered something to be given to her to eat. 56 And her parents were astonished, but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened.

Luke,"1 And summoning the twelve, he gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases, 2 and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. 3 And he said to them, “Take along nothing for the journey—neither a staff, nor a traveler’s bag, nor bread, nor money, nor to have two tunics apiece. 4 And into whatever house you enter, stay there and depart from there. 5 And as for all those who do not welcome you—when you depart from that town, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.” 6 So they departed and went throughout the villages, proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere. 7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John has been raised from the dead, 8 and by some that Elijah had appeared, and others that some prophet of ancient times had risen. 9 And Herod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” And he was wanting to see him. 10 And when they returned, the apostles described to him all that they had done. And he took them along and withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida. 11 But when the crowds found out, they followed him, and welcoming them, he began to speak to them about the kingdom of God, and he cured those who had need of healing. 12 Now the day began to be far spent, and the twelve came up and said to him, “Send away the crowd so that they can go into the surrounding villages and farms to obtain lodging and find provisions, because we are here in a desolate place. 13 But he said to them, “You give them something to eat!” And they said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and purchase food for all these people.” 14 (For there were about five thousand men.) So he said to his disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.” 15 And they did so, and had them all sit down. 16 And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them and began giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd. 17 And they all ate and were satisfied, and what was left over was picked up by them—twelve baskets of broken pieces. 18 And it happened that while he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, saying, “Who do the crowds say that I am?” 19 And they answered and said, “John the Baptist, but others, Elijah, and others, that one of the ancient prophets has risen.” 20 And he said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” And Peter answered and said, “The Christ of God.” 21 But he warned and commanded them to tell this to no one, 22 saying, “It is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day. 23 And he said to them all, “If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross every day and follow me. 24 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me, this person will save it. 25 For what is a person benefited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself? 26 For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of this person when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. 27 But I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the kingdom of God.” 28 Now it happened that about eight days after these words, he took along Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray. 29 And as he was praying, the appearance of his face became different, and his clothing became white, gleaming like lightning. 30 And behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah, 31 who appeared in glory and were speaking about his departure which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem. 32 Now Peter and those with him were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him. 33 And it happened that as they were going away from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he was saying. 34 And while he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud. 35 And a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One. Listen to him!” 36 And after the voice had occurred, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen. 37 Now it happened that on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. 38 And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look with concern on my son, because he is my only son! 39 And behold, a spirit seizes him and suddenly he screams, and it convulses him with foam and rarely withdraws from him, battering him severely. 40 And I begged your disciples that they would expel it, and they were not able to do so.” 41 So Jesus answered and said, “O unbelieving and perverted generation! How long will I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!” 42 And while he was still approaching, the demon threw him down and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. 43 And they were all astounded at the impressiveness of God. But while they were all marveling at all the things that he was doing, he said to his disciples, 44 “You take these words to heart, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.” 45 But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they could not understand it. And they were afraid to ask him about this statement. 46 And an argument developed among them as to who of them might be greatest. 47 But Jesus, because he knew the thoughts of their hearts, took hold of a child and had him stand beside him 48 and said to them, “Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For the one who is least among you all—this one is great.” 49 And John answered and said, “Master, we saw someone expelling demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow in company with us.” 50 But Jesus said to him, “Do not prevent him, because whoever is not against you is for you.” 51 Now it happened that when the days were approaching for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. 52 And he sent messengers before him, and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans in order to prepare for him. 53 And they did not welcome him because he was determined to go to Jerusalem. 54 Now when the disciples James and John saw it, they said, “Lord, do you want us to call fire to come down from heaven and consume them?” 55 But he turned around and rebuked them, 56 and they proceeded to another village. 57 And as they were traveling on the road, someone said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go!” 58 And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.” 59 And he said to another, “Follow me!” But he said, “Lord, first allow me to go and bury my father.” 60 But he said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead! But you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” 61 And another person also said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say farewell to those in my house.” 62 But Jesus said, “No one who puts his hand on the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God!” 1 And after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy-two others and sent them out two by two before him into every town and place where he was about to go. 2 And he said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest that he send out workers into his harvest. 3 Go! Behold, I am sending you out like lambs in the midst of wolves! 4 Do not carry a money bag or a traveler’s bag or sandals, and greet no one along the road. 5 And into whatever house you enter, first say, “Peace be to this household!” 6 And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him. But if not, it will return to you. 7 And remain in the same house, eating and drinking whatever they provide, for the worker is worthy of his pay. Do not move from house to house. 8 And into whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat whatever is set before you, 9 and heal the sick in it, and say to them, “The kingdom of God has come near to you.” 10 But into whatever town you enter and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say, 11 “Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you! Nevertheless know this: that the kingdom of God has come near!” 12 I tell you that it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town! 13 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes! 14 But it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon in the judgment than for you! 15 And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to Hades! 16 The one who listens to you listens to me, and the one who rejects you rejects me. But the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.” 17 And the seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!” 18 So he said to them, “I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven. 19 Behold, I have given you the authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will ever harm you. 20 Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are inscribed in heaven.” 21 At that same time he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to young children. Yes, Father, for this was pleasing before you. 22 All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wants to reveal him.” 23 And turning to the disciples, he said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see the things which you see! 24 For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and did not hear them.” ",Luke 9:1-10:24,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-911024-245607/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-09_luke-911024_20111214131103.mp3
Luke,"25 And behold, a certain legal expert stood up to test him, saying, “Teacher, what must I do so that I will inherit eternal life?” 26 And he said to him, “What is written in the law? How do you read it?” 27 And he answered and said, “You shall love the Lord your God from all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” 28 And he said to him, “You have answered correctly. Do this and you will live.” 29 But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” 30 And Jesus replied and said, “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who both stripped him and beat him. After inflicting blows on him, they went away, leaving him half dead. 31 Now by coincidence a certain priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side. 32 And in the same way also a Levite, when he came down to the place and saw him, passed by on the opposite side. 33 But a certain Samaritan who was traveling came up to him and, when he saw him, had compassion. 34 And he came up and bandaged his wounds, pouring on olive oil and wine, and he put him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. 35 And on the next day, he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, and said, “Take care of him, and whatever you spend in addition, I will repay to you when I return. 36 Which of these three do you suppose became a neighbor of the man who fell among the robbers?” 37 So he said, “The one who showed mercy to him.” And Jesus said to him, “You go and do likewise.” 38 Now as they traveled along, he entered into a certain village. And a certain woman named Martha welcomed him. 39 And she had a sister named Mary, who also sat at the feet of Jesus and was listening to his teaching. 40 But Martha was distracted with much preparation, so she approached and said, “Lord, is it not a concern to you that my sister has left me alone to make preparations? Then tell her that she should help me!” 41 But the Lord answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things! 42 But few things are necessary, or only one thing, for Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her.” ",Luke 10:25-42,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-1025-42-245608/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-10_luke-1025-42_20111214131258.mp3
Luke,"1 And it happened that while he was in a certain place praying, when he stopped a certain one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.” 2 And he said to them, “When you pray, say, “Father, may your name be treated as holy. May your kingdom come. 3 Give us each day our daily bread. 4 And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into temptation.” 5 And he said to them, “Who of you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves, 6 because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey, and I do not have anything to set before him.’ 7 And that one will answer from inside and say, ‘Do not cause me trouble! The door has already been shut and my children are with me in bed! I am not able to get up to give you anything.’ 8 I tell you, even if he does not give him anything after he gets up because he is his friend, at any rate because of his impudence he will get up and give him whatever he needs. 9 And I tell you, ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened for you. 10 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. 11 But what father from among you, if his son will ask for a fish, instead of a fish will give him a snake? 12 Or also, if he will ask for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 13 Therefore if you, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?” 14 And he was expelling a mute demon. Now it happened that when the demon came out, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowds were astonished. 15 But some of them said, “By Beelzebul the ruler of demons he expels demons!” 16 And others, in order to test him, were demanding from him a sign from heaven. 17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls. 18 So if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I expel demons by Beelzebul. 19 But if I expel demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons expel them? For this reason they will be your judges! 20 But if I expel demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you! 21 When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his possessions are safe. 22 But when a stronger man attacks him and conquers him, he takes away his full armor in which he trusted and distributes his plunder. 23 The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters. 24 “Whenever an unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it travels through waterless places searching for rest, and does not find it. It says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came out.’ 25 And when it arrives it finds the house swept and put in order. 26 Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there. And the last state of that person becomes worse than the first!” 27 Now it happened that as he said these things, a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts at which you nursed!” 28 But he said, “On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and follow it!” 29 And as the crowds were increasing, he began to say, “This generation is an evil generation! It demands a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah! 30 For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation. 31 The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here! 32 The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here! 33 “No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a bushel basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who come in can see the light. 34 Your eye is the lamp of the body. When your eye is sincere, your whole body is full of light also. But when it is evil, your body is dark also. 35 Therefore pay careful attention that the light in you is not darkness! 36 If therefore your whole body is full of light, not having any part dark, it will be completely full of light, as when the lamp with its light gives light to you.” 37 And as he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to have a meal with him, and he went in and reclined at table. 38 And the Pharisee, when he saw it, was astonished that he did not first wash before the meal. 39 But the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but your inside is full of greediness and wickedness. 40 Fools! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also? 41 But give as charitable giving the things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you. 42 “But woe to you, Pharisees, because you pay a tenth of mint and rue and every garden herb, and neglect justice and love for God! But it was necessary to do these things without neglecting those things also. 43 Woe to you, Pharisees, because you love the best seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces! 44 Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, and the people who walk over them do not know it! 45 And one of the legal experts answered and said to him, “Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also!” 46 So he said, “Woe to you also, legal experts, because you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers! 47 Woe to you, because you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them! 48 As a result you are witnesses, and you approve of the deeds of your fathers, because they killed them and you build their tombs! 49 For this reason also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute,’ 50 so that the blood of all the prophets that has been shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation, 51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the temple building. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation! 52 Woe to you, legal experts, because you have taken away the key to knowledge! You did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering!” 53 And when he departed from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly hostile, and to question him closely about many things, 54 plotting to catch him with reference to something he might say.

Luke,"1 During this time when a crowd of many thousands had gathered together, so that they were trampling one another, he began to say to his disciples first, “Beware for yourselves of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 2 But nothing is concealed that will not be revealed, and secret that will not be made known. 3 Therefore everything that you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops. 4 “And I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after these things do not have anything more to do. 5 But I will show you whom you should fear: fear the one who has authority, after the killing, to throw you into hell! Yes, I tell you, fear this one! 6 Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God. 7 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered! Do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. 8 “And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before people, the Son of Man also will acknowledge him before the angels of God, 9 but the one who denies me before people will be denied before the angels of God. 10 And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him, but to the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven. 11 But when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious how or what you should speak in your own defense or what you should say, 12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what it is necessary to say.” 13 Now someone from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me!” 14 But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?” 15 And he said to them, “Watch out and guard yourselves from all greediness, because not even when someone has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.” 16 And he told a parable to them, saying, “The land of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. 17 And he reasoned to himself, saying, ‘What should I do? For I do not have anywhere I can gather in my crops.’ 18 And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and I will gather in there all my grain and possessions. 19 And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have many possessions stored up for many years. Relax, eat, drink, celebrate!” ’ 20 But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your life is demanded from you, and the things which you have prepared—whose will they be?’ 21 So is the one who stores up treasure for himself, and who is not rich toward God!” 22 And he said to his disciples, “For this reason I tell you, do not be anxious for your life, what you will eat, or for your body, what you will wear. 23 For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. 24 Consider the ravens, that they neither sow nor reap; to them there is neither storeroom nor barn, and God feeds them. How much more are you worth than the birds? 25 And which of you by being anxious is able to add an hour to his life span? 26 If then you are not even able to do a very little thing, why are you anxious about the rest? 27 Consider the lilies, how they grow: they do not toil or spin, but I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these. 28 But if God clothes the grass in the field in this way, although it is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he do so for you, you of little faith? 29 And you, do not consider what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not be anxious. 30 For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need these things. 31 But seek his kingdom and these things will be added to you. 32 “Do not be afraid, little flock, because your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom. 33 Sell your possessions and give charitable gifts. Make for yourselves money bags that do not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven where thief does not approach or moth destroy. 34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 35 “You must be prepared for action and your lamps burning. 36 And you, be like people who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that when he comes back and knocks, they can open the door for him immediately. 37 Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he returns! Truly I say to you that he will dress himself for service and have them recline at the table and will come by and serve them. 38 Even if he should come back in the second or in the third watch of the night and find them like this, blessed are they! 39 But understand this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into. 40 You also must be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think he will come.” 41 And Peter said, “Lord, are you telling this parable for us, or also for everyone?” 42 And the Lord said, “Who then is the faithful wise manager whom the master will put in charge over his servants to give them their food allowance at the right time? 43 Blessed is that slave whom his master will find so doing when he comes back. 44 Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions. 45 But if that slave should say to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time to return,’ and he begins to beat the male slaves and the female slaves and to eat and drink and get drunk, 46 the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know, and will cut him in two and assign his place with the unbelievers. 47 And that slave who knew the will of his master and did not prepare or do according to his will will be given a severe beating. 48 But the one who did not know and did things deserving blows will be given a light beating. And from everyone to whom much has been given, much will be demanded, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will ask him for even more. 49 “I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish that it had been kindled already! 50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am distressed until it is accomplished! 51 Do you think that I have come to grant peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division! 52 For from now on there will be five in one household, divided three against two and two against three. 53 They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.” 54 And he also said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud coming up in the west, you say at once, ‘A rainstorm is coming,’ and so it happens. 55 And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be burning heat,’ and it happens. 56 Hypocrites! You know how to evaluate the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it you do not know how to evaluate this present time? 57 And why do you not also judge for yourselves what is right? 58 For as you are going with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to come to a settlement with him on the way, so that he will not drag you to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the bailiff, and the bailiff will throw you into prison. 59 I tell you, you will never get out of there until you have paid back even the last cent!” ",Luke 12,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-12-245610/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-12_luke-12_20111214131501.mp3
Luke,"1 Now at the same time some had come to tell him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 2 And he answered and said to them, “Do you think that these Galileans were sinners worse than all the Galileans, because they suffered these things? 3 No, I tell you, but unless you repent you will all perish as well! 4 Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them—do you think that they were sinners worse than all the people who live in Jerusalem? 5 No, I tell you, but unless you repent, you will all perish as well!” 6 And he told this parable: “A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any. 7 So he said to the gardener, ‘Behold, for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and did not find any. Cut it down! Why should it even exhaust the soil?’ 8 But he answered and said to him, ‘Sir, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put manure on it. 9 And if indeed it produces fruit in the coming year, so much the better, but if not, you can cut it down.’ ” 10 Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. 11 And behold, a woman was there who had a spirit that had disabled her for eighteen years, and she was bent over and not able to straighten herself up completely. 12 And when he saw her, Jesus summoned her and said to her, “Woman, you are freed from your disability!” 13 And he placed his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and glorified God. 14 But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, answered and said to the crowd, “There are six days on which it is necessary to work. Therefore come and be healed on them, and not on the day of the Sabbath!” 15 But the Lord answered and said to him, “Hypocrites! Does not each one of you untie his ox or his donkey from the feeding trough on the Sabbath and lead it away to water it? 16 And this woman, who is a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound eighteen long years—is it not necessary that she be released from this bond on the day of the Sabbath?” 17 And when he said these things, all those who opposed him were humiliated, and the whole crowd was rejoicing at all the splendid things that were being done by him. 18 Therefore he said, “What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it? 19 It is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his own garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the sky nested in its branches.” 20 And again he said, “To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? 21 It is like yeast that a woman took and hid in three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened.” 22 And he was going throughout towns and villages, teaching and making his journey toward Jerusalem. 23 And someone said to him, “Lord, are there only a few who are saved?” And he said to them, 24 “Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able to, 25 when once the master of the house has gotten up and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, ‘Lord, open the door for us!’ And he will answer and say to you, ‘I do not know where you are from!’ 26 Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets!’ 27 And he will reply, saying to you, ‘I do not know where you are from! Go away from me, all you evildoers!’ 28 In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves thrown outside! 29 And they will come from east and west, and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God. 30 And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.” 31 At that same hour some Pharisees came up and said to him, “Go out and depart from here, because Herod wants to kill you!” 32 And he said to them, “Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I am expelling demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will complete my work.’ 33 Nevertheless, it is necessary for me to be on the way today and tomorrow and on the next day, because it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside Jerusalem. 34 “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How many times I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you were not willing! 35 Behold, your house has been left to you! And I tell you, you will never see me until the time will come when you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’ ” 1 And it happened that when he came to the house of a certain one of the leaders of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat a meal, they were watching him closely. 2 And behold, a certain man was in front of him, suffering from edema. 3 And Jesus answered and said to the legal experts and Pharisees, saying, “Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath, or not?” 4 But they remained silent. And he took hold of him and healed him, and sent him away. 5 And he said to them, “Who among you, if your son or your ox falls into a well on the day of the Sabbath, will not immediately pull him out?” 6 And they were not able to make a reply to these things. 7 Now he told a parable to those who had been invited when he noticed how they were choosing for themselves the places of honor, saying to them, ",Luke 13:1-14:7,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-131147-245611/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-13_luke-131147_20111214131506.mp3
Luke,"7 Now he told a parable to those who had been invited when he noticed how they were choosing for themselves the places of honor, saying to them, 8 “When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not recline at the table in the place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you has been invited by him, 9 and the one who invited you both will come and say to you, ‘Give the place to this person,’ and then with shame you will begin to take the last place. 10 But when you are invited, go and recline at the table in the last place, so that when the one who invited you comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then it will be an honor to you in the presence of all those who are reclining at the table with you. 11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” 12 And he also said to the one who had invited him, “When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or wealthy neighbors, lest they also invite you in return, and repayment come to you. 13 But whenever you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, 14 and you will be blessed, because they are not able to repay you. For it will be paid back to you at the resurrection of the righteous.” 15 Now when one of those reclining at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, “Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!” 16 But he said to him, “A certain man was giving a large banquet and invited many. 17 And he sent his slave at the hour of the banquet to say to those who have been invited, ‘Come, because now it is ready!’ 18 And they all alike began to excuse themselves. The first said to him, ‘I have purchased a field, and I must go out to look at it. I ask you, consider me excused.’ 19 And another said, ‘I have purchased five yoke of oxen, and I am going to examine them. I ask you, consider me excused.’ 20 And another said, ‘I have married a wife, and for this reason I am not able to come.’ 21 And the slave came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his slave, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame!’ 22 And the slave said, ‘Sir, what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.’ 23 And the master said to the slave, ‘Go out into the highways and hedges and press them to come in, so that my house will be filled! 24 For I say to you that none of those persons who were invited will taste my banquet!’ ” 25 Now large crowds were going along with him, and he turned around and said to them, 26 “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and furthermore, even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. 27 Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. 28 For which of you, wanting to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it? 29 Otherwise after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish it, all who see it will begin to ridicule him, 30 saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish!’ 31 Or what king, going out to engage another king in battle, does not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand. 32 But if not, while the other is still far away, he sends an ambassador and asks for terms of peace. 33 In the same way, therefore, every one of you who does not renounce all his own possessions cannot be my disciple. 34 “Now salt is good, but if salt becomes tasteless, with what will it be made salty? 35 It is usable neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; they throw it out. The one who has ears to hear, let him hear!” 1 Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were drawing near to hear him. 2 And both the Pharisees and the scribes were complaining, saying, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them!” 3 So he told them this parable, saying, ",Luke 14:7-15:3,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-147153-247067/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-16_luke-147153_20111220160059.mp3
Luke,"3 So he told them this parable, saying, 4 “What man of you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the grassland and go after the one that was lost until he finds it? 5 And when he has found it, he places it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 6 And when he returns to his home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!’ 7 I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance. 8 Or what woman who has ten drachmas, if she loses one drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? 9 And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found the drachma that I had lost!’ 10 In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” 11 And he said, “A certain man had two sons. 12 And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the property that is coming to me.’ So he divided his assets between them. 13 And after not many days, the younger son gathered everything and went on a journey to a distant country, and there he squandered his wealth by living wastefully. 14 And after he had spent everything, there was a severe famine throughout that country, and he began to be in need. 15 And he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to tend pigs. 16 And he was longing to fill his stomach with the carob pods that the pigs were eating, and no one was giving anything to him. 17 “But when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired workers have an abundance of food, and I am dying here from hunger! 18 I will set out and go to my father and will say to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight! 19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son! Make me like one of your hired workers.’ 20 And he set out and came to his own father. But while he was still a long way away, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. 21 And his son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight! I am no longer worthy to be called your son!’ 22 But his father said to his slaves, ‘Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet! 23 And bring the fattened calf—kill it and let us eat and celebrate, 24 because this son of mine was dead, and is alive again! He was lost and is found!’ And they began to celebrate. 25 “Now his older son was in the field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing. 26 And he summoned one of the slaves and asked what these things meant. 27 And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has gotten him back healthy.’ 28 But he became angry and did not want to go in. So his father came out and began to implore him. 29 But he answered and said to his father, ‘Behold, so many years I have served you, and have never disobeyed your command! And you never gave me a young goat so that I could celebrate with my friends! 30 But when this son of yours returned—who has consumed your assets with prostitutes—you killed the fattened calf for him!’ 31 But he said to him, ‘Child, you are always with me, and everything I have belongs to you. 32 But it was necessary to celebrate and to rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead, and is alive, and was lost, and is found!’ ” ",Luke 15:3-32,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-153-32-247068/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-17_luke-153-32_20111220160103.mp3
Luke,"1 And he also said to the disciples, “A certain man was rich, who had a manager. And charges were brought to him that this person was squandering his possessions. 2 And he summoned him and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give the account of your management, because you can no longer manage.’ 3 And the manager said to himself, ‘What should I do, because my master is taking away the management from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg. 4 I know what I should do, so that when I am removed from the management they will welcome me into their homes!’ 5 And he summoned each one of his own master’s debtors and said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ 6 And he said, ‘A hundred measures of olive oil.’ So he said to him, ‘Take your promissory note and sit down quickly and write fifty.’ 7 Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ And he said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your promissory note and write eighty.’ 8 And the master praised the dishonest manager, because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this age are shrewder than the sons of light with regard to their own generation. 9 And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it runs out they will welcome you into the eternal dwellings. 10 “The one who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much, and the one who is dishonest in very little is also dishonest in much. 11 If then you have not been faithful with unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? 12 And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you your own? 13 No domestic slave is able to serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and will despise the other. You are not able to serve God and money.” 14 Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him. 15 And he said to them, “You are the ones who justify themselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts! For what is considered exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. 16 “The law and the prophets were until John; from that time on the kingdom of God has been proclaimed, and everyone is urgently pressed into it. 17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the law to become invalid. 18 “Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and the one who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.

Luke,"19 “Now a certain man was rich, and dressed in purple cloth and fine linen, feasting sumptuously every day. 20 And a certain poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, lay at his gate, 21 and was longing to be filled with what fell from the table of the rich man. But even the dogs came and licked his sores. 22 Now it happened that the poor man died, and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s side. And the rich man also died and was buried. 23 And in Hades he lifted up his eyes as he was in torment and saw Abraham from a distance, and Lazarus at his side. 24 And he called out and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he could dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am suffering pain in this flame!’ 25 But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you received your good things during your life, and Lazarus likewise bad things. But now he is comforted here, but you are suffering pain. 26 And in addition to all these things, a great chasm has been established between us and you, so that those who want to cross over from here to you are not able to do so, nor can they cross over from there to us.’ 27 So he said, ‘Then I ask you, father, that you send him to my father’s house, 28 for I have five brothers, so that he could warn them, in order that they also should not come to this place of torment!’ 29 But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; they must listen to them.’ 30 And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent!’ 31 But he said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone rises from the dead.’ ” 1 And he said to his disciples, “It is impossible for causes for stumbling not to come, but woe to him through whom they come! 2 It would be better for him if a millstone is placed around his neck and he is thrown into the sea than that he causes one of these little ones to sin. 3 “Be concerned about yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. 4 And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times he returns to you saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.” 5 And the apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” 6 So the Lord said, “If you have faith like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. 7 “And which of you who has a slave plowing or shepherding sheep who comes in from the field will say to him, ‘Come here at once and recline at the table’? 8 Will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare something that I may eat, and dress yourself to serve me while I eat and drink, and after these things you will eat and drink.’ 9 He will not be grateful to the slave because he did what was ordered, will he? 10 Thus you also, when you have done all the things you were ordered to do, say, ‘We are unworthy slaves; we have done what we were obligated to do.’ ” 11 And it happened that while traveling toward Jerusalem, he was passing through the region between Samaria and Galilee. 12 And as he was entering into a certain village, ten men met him—lepers, who stood at a distance. 13 And they raised their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” 14 And when he saw them he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And it happened that as they were going, they were cleansed. 15 But one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice. 16 And he fell on his face at his feet, giving thanks to him. And he was a Samaritan. 17 So Jesus answered and said, “Were not ten cleansed? And where are the nine? 18 Was no one found to turn back and give praise to God except this foreigner?” 19 And he said to him, “Get up and go your way. Your faith has saved you.” 20 Now when he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them and said, “The kingdom of God does not come with things that can be observed, 21 nor will they say, ‘Behold, here it is!’ or ‘There!’ For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.” 22 And he said to the disciples, “Days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. 23 And they will say to you, ‘Behold, there!’ ‘Behold, here!’ Do not go out or run after them! 24 For just as the lightning shines forth, flashing from one place under heaven to another place under heaven, so the Son of Man will be in his day. 25 But first it is necessary for him to suffer many things, and to be rejected by this generation. 26 And just as it was in the days of Noah, so also it will be in the days of the Son of Man—27 they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 28 Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot—they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building. 29 But on the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all. 30 It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed. 31 On that day, whoever is on the housetop and his goods are in the house must not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field must not turn back 32 Remember Lot’s wife! 33 Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses it will keep it. 34 I tell you that in that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left. 35 There will be two women grinding at the same place; one will be taken and the other will be left.” 37 And they answered and said to him, “Where, Lord?” So he said to them, “Where the dead body is, there also the vultures will be gathered.” ",Luke 16:19-17:37,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-16191737-247070/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-19_luke-16191737_20111220160303.mp3
Luke,"1 And he told them a parable to show that they must always pray and not be discouraged, 2 saying, “There was a certain judge in a certain town who did not fear God and did not respect people. 3 And there was a widow in that town, and she kept coming to him, saying, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary!’ 4 And he was not willing for a time, but after these things he said to himself, ‘Even if I do not fear God or respect people, 5 yet because this widow is causing trouble for me, I will grant her justice, so that she does not wear me down in the end by her coming back!’ ” 6 And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge is saying! 7 And will not God surely see to it that justice is done to his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night, and will he delay toward them? 8 I tell you that he will see to it that justice is done for them soon! Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, then will he find faith on earth?” 9 And he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and looked down on everyone else: 10 “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed these things with reference to himself: ‘God, I give thanks to you that I am not like other people—swindlers, unrighteous people, adulterers, or even like this tax collector! 12 I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all that I get.’ 13 But the tax collector, standing far away, did not want even to raise his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ 14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than that one! For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” 15 Now they were bringing even their babies to him so that he could touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 16 But Jesus called them to himself, saying, “Allow the children to come to me, and do not forbid them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 17 Truly I say to you, whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it.” 18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, by doing what will I inherit eternal life?” 19 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. 20 You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’ ” 21 And he said, “All these I have observed from my youth.” 22 And when he heard this, Jesus said to him, “You still lack one thing: Sell all that you have, and distribute the proceeds to the poor—and you will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me.” 23 But when he heard these things he became very sad, because he was extremely wealthy. 24 And Jesus took notice of him and said, “How difficult it is for those who possess wealth to enter into the kingdom of God! 25 For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God. 26 So those who heard this said, “And who can be saved?” 27 But he said, “What is impossible with men is possible with God.” 28 And Peter said, “Behold, we have left all that is ours and followed you.” 29 And he said to them, “Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children on account of the kingdom of God, 30 who will not receive many times more in this time and in the age to come, eternal life.” 31 And taking aside the twelve, he said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written by the prophets with reference to the Son of Man will be accomplished. 32 For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and mistreated and spit on, 33 and after flogging him they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.” 34 And they understood none of these things, and this saying was concealed from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said. 35 Now it happened that as he drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting on the side of the road begging. 36 And when he heard a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant. 37 And they told him, “Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.” 38 And he called out, saying, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 39 And those who were in front rebuked him, that he should be silent, but he cried out even more loudly, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 40 So Jesus stopped and ordered him to be brought to him. And when he approached, he asked him, 41 “What do you want me to do for you?” And he said, “Lord, that I may regain my sight. 42 And Jesus said to him, “Regain your sight! Your faith has saved you.” 43 And immediately he regained his sight and began to follow him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.

Luke,"1 And he entered and traveled through Jericho. 2 And there was a man named Zacchaeus, and he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. 3 And he was seeking to see Jesus—who he was—and he was not able to as a result of the crowd, because he was short in stature. 4 And he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree so that he could see him, because he was going to go through that way. 5 And when he came to the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down quickly, because it is necessary for me to stay at your house today!” 6 And he came down quickly and welcomed him joyfully. 7 And when they saw it, they all began to complain, saying, “He has gone in to find lodging with a man who is a sinner!” 8 And Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, “Behold, half of my possessions, Lord, I am giving to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone, I am paying it back four times as much!” 9 And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save those who are lost.” 11 Now while they were listening to these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately. 12 Therefore he said, “A certain nobleman traveled to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return. 13 And summoning ten of his own slaves, he gave them ten minas and said to them, ‘Do business until I come back.’ 14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to be king over us!’ 15 And it happened that when he returned after receiving the kingdom, he ordered these slaves to whom he had given the money to be summoned to him, so that he could know what they had gained by trading. 16 So the first arrived, saying, ‘Sir, your mina has made ten minas more!’ 17 And he said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because you have been faithful in a very small thing, have authority over ten cities.’ 18 And the second came, saying, ‘Sir, your mina has made five minas.’ 19 So he said to this one also, ‘And you be over five cities.’ 20 And another came, saying, ‘Sir, behold your mina, which I had put away for safekeeping in a piece of cloth. 21 For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man—you withdraw what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow!’ 22 He said to him, ‘By your own words I will judge you, wicked slave! You knew that I am a severe man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow. 23 And why did you not give my money to the bank, and I, when I returned, would have collected it with interest?’ 24 And to the bystanders he said, ‘Take away from him the mina and give it to the one who has the ten minas!’ 25 And they said to him, ‘Sir, he has ten minas.’ 26 ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. 27 But these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here and slaughter them in my presence!’ ” 28 And after he had said these things, he traveled on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. 29 And it happened that when he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples, 30 saying, ‘Go into the village in front of you, in which as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no person has ever sat, and untie it and bring it. 31 And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you will say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’ ” 32 So those who were sent went and found it just as he had told them. 33 And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, ‘Why are you untying the colt?’ 34 So they said, ‘The Lord has need of it.’ 35 And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they put Jesus on it. 36 And as he was going along, they were spreading out their cloaks on the road. 37 Now as he was drawing near by this time to the descent from the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles that they had seen, 38 saying, “Blessed is the king, the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!” 39 And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!” 40 And he answered and said, “I tell you that if these keep silent, the stones will cry out!” 41 And when he approached and saw the city, he wept over it, 42 saying, “If you had known on this day—even you—the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. 43 For days will come upon you and your enemies will put up an embankment against you, and will surround you and press you hard from all directions. 44 And they will raze you to the ground, you and your children within you, and will not leave a stone upon a stone within you, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.” 45 And he entered into the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling, 46 saying to them, “It is written, ‘And my house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a cave of robbers!” 47 And he was teaching every day in the temple courts, and the chief priests and the scribes and the most prominent men of the people were seeking to destroy him. 48 And they did not find anything they could do, because all the people were paying close attention to what they were hearing from him.

Luke,"1 And it happened that on one of the days while he was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes approached together with the elders 2 and said, saying to him, “Tell us, by what authority you are doing these things, or who is the one who gave you this authority? 3 And he answered and said to them, “I also will ask you a question, and you tell me: 4 The baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men? 5 And they discussed this with one another, saying, “If we say ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’ 6 But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us to death, because they are convinced that John was a prophet.” 7 And they replied that they did not know where it was from. 8 And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.” 9 And he began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey for a long time. 10 And at the proper time he sent a slave to the tenant farmers, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenant farmers sent him away empty-handed after beating him. 11 And he proceeded to send another slave, but they beat and dishonored that one also, and sent him away empty-handed. 12 And he proceeded to send a third, but they wounded and threw out this one also. 13 So the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’ 14 But when the tenant farmers saw him, they began to reason with one another, saying, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance will become ours!’ 15 And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? 16 He will come and destroy those tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others.” And when they heard this, they said, “May this never happen!” 17 But he looked intently at them and said, “What then is this that is written: ‘The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the cornerstone.’ 18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls—it will crush him!” 19 And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay their hands on him at that same hour, and they were afraid of the people, for they knew that he had told this parable with reference to them. 20 And they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended they were upright, in order that they could catch him in a statement, so that they could hand him over to the authority and the jurisdiction of the governor. 21 And they asked him, saying, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and do not show partiality, but teach the way of God in truth. 22 Is it permitted for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” 23 But seeing through their craftiness, he said to them, 24 “Show me a denarius! Whose image and inscription does it have?” And they answered and said, “Caesar’s.” 25 So he said to them, “Well then, give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!” 26 And they were not able to catch him in a statement in the sight of the people, and astonished at his answer, they became silent. 27 Now some of the Sadducees—who deny that there is a resurrection—came up and asked him, 28 saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us if someone’s brother dies having a wife, and this man is childless, that his brother should take the wife and father descendants for his brother. 29 Now there were seven brothers, and the first took a wife and died childless, 30 and the second, 31 and the third took her, and likewise also the seven did not leave children and died. 32 Finally the woman also died. 33 Therefore in the resurrection, the woman—whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.” 34 And Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, 35 but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, 36 for they are not even able to die any longer, because they are like the angels and are sons of God, because they are sons of the resurrection. 37 But that the dead are raised, even Moses revealed in the passage about the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. 38 Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him!” 39 And some of the scribes answered and said, “Teacher, you have spoken well.” 40 For they no longer dared to ask him anything. 41 But he said to them, “In what sense do they say that the Christ is David’s son? 42 For David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, 43 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.” ’ 44 David therefore calls him ‘Lord,’ and how is he his son?” 45 And while all the people were listening, he said to the disciples, 46 “Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets, 47 who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy prayers for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!” ",Luke 20,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-20-247073/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-24_luke-20_20111220160658.mp3
Luke,"1 And he looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the contribution box, 2 and he saw a certain poor widow putting in there two small copper coins. 3 And he said, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all of them. 4 For these all put gifts into the offering out of their abundance, but this woman out of her poverty put in all the means of subsistence that she had.” 5 And while some were speaking about the temple, that it was adorned with precious stones and votive offerings, he said, 6 “As for these things that you see—days will come in which not one stone will be left on another stone that will not be thrown down!” 7 And they asked him, saying, “Teacher, when therefore will these things happen, and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?” 8 And he said, Watch out that you are not deceived! For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and ‘The time is near!’ Do not go after them! 9 And when you hear about wars and insurrections, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not be at once.” 10 Then he said to them, “nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom. 11 There will be great earthquakes and famines and plagues in various places. There will be terrible sights and great signs from heaven. 12 “But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, handing you over to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and governors because of my name. 13 This will turn out to you for a time of witness. 14 Therefore make up your minds not to prepare in advance to speak in your own defense, 15 for I will give you a mouth and wisdom that all your opponents will not be able to resist or contradict. 16 And you will be handed over even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put to death some of you. 17 And you will be hated by all because of my name. 18 Even a hair of your head will never perish! 19 By your patient endurance you will gain your lives. 20 “But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. 21 Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those inside it must depart, and those in the fields must not enter into it, 22 because these are days of vengeance, so that all the things that are written can be fulfilled. 23 Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days! For there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people, 24 and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. 25 “And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity from the noise of the sea and its surging, 26 people fainting from fear and expectation of what is coming on the inhabited earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 27 And then they will see the Son of Man arriving in a cloud with power and great glory. 28 But when these things begin to happen, stand up straight and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near!” 29 And he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees. 30 When they put out foliage, now you see for yourselves and know that by this time the summer is near. 31 So also you, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. 32 Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all things take place! 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 34 “But take care for yourselves, lest your hearts are weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of daily life, and that day come upon you suddenly 35 like a trap. For it will come upon all who reside on the face of the whole earth. 36 But be alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.” 37 So throughout the days he was teaching in the temple courts, and throughout the nights he was going out and spending the night on the hill that is called the Mount of Olives. 38 And all the people were getting up very early in the morning to come to him in the temple courts to listen to him.

Luke,"1 Now the feast of Unleavened Bread (which is called Passover) was drawing near. 2 And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they could destroy him, because they were afraid of the people. 3 And Satan entered into Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve. 4 And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers of the temple guard how he could betray him to them. 5 And they were delighted, and came to an agreement with him to give him money. 6 And he agreed, and began looking for a favorable opportunity to betray him to them apart from the crowd. 7 And the day of the feast of Unleavened Bread came, on which it was necessary for the Passover lamb to be sacrificed. 8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it. 9 So they said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?” 10 And he said to them, “Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters. 11 And you will say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’ 12 And he will show you a large furnished upstairs room. Make preparations there.” 13 So they went and found everything just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover. 14 And when the hour came, he reclined at the table, and the apostles with him. 15 And he said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. 16 For I tell you that I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” 17 And he took in hand a cup, and after giving thanks he said, “Take this and share it among yourselves. 18 For I tell you, from now on I will not drink of the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.” 19 And he took bread, and after giving thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” 20 And in the same way the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood which is poured out for you. 21 “But behold, the hand of the one who is betraying me is with me on the table! 22 For the Son of Man is going according to what has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!” 23 And they began to debate with one another who then of them it could be who was going to do this. 24 And a dispute also occurred among them as to which of them was recognized as being greatest. 25 So he said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors. 26 But you are not to be like this! But the one who is greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves. 27 For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am in your midst as the one who serves. 28 “And you are the ones who have remained with me in my trials, 29 and I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred on me, 30 that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 31 “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to sift you like wheat, 32 but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. And you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” 33 But he said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!” 34 And he said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know me!” ",Luke 22:1-34,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-221-34-247075/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-26_luke-221-34_20111220160702.mp3
Luke,"35 And he said to them, “When I sent you out without a money bag and a traveler’s bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?” And they said, “Nothing.” 36 And he said to them, “But now the one who has a money bag must take it, and likewise a traveler’s bag. And the one who does not have a sword must sell his cloak and buy one. 37 For I tell you that this that is written must be fulfilled in me: ‘And he was counted with the criminals.’ For indeed, what is written about me is being fulfilled.” 38 So they said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords!” And he said to them, “It is adequate.” 39 And he went away and proceeded, according to his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him. 40 And when he came to the place, he said to them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.” 41 And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw and knelt down and began to pray, 42 saying, “Father, if you are willing, take away this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will but yours be done.” ?43 And an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. 44 And being in anguish, he began praying more fervently and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down to the ground.? 45 And when he got up from the prayer and came to the disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow, 46 and he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you will not enter into temptation!” 47 While he was still speaking, behold, there came a crowd, and the one named Judas, one of the twelve, leading them. And he approached Jesus to kiss him. 48 But Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?” 49 And when those around him saw what was about to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with the sword?” 50 And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. 51 But Jesus answered and said, “Stop! No more of this!” And he touched his ear and healed him. 52 And Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come out against him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber? 53 Every day when I was with you in the temple courts, you did not stretch out your hands against me! But this is your hour and the domain of darkness!” 54 And they arrested him and led him away and brought him into the house of the high priest. But Peter was following at a distance. 55 And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. 56 And a certain female slave, seeing him sitting in the light and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him!” 57 But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him!” 58 And after a short time another person saw him and said, “You also are one of them!” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!” 59 And after about one hour had passed, someone else was insisting, saying, “In truth this man also was with him, because he is also a Galilean!” 60 But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about!” And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 61 And the Lord turned around and looked intently at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.” 62 And he went outside and wept bitterly.

Luke,"63 And the men who were guarding him began to mock him while they beat him, 64 and after blindfolding him they repeatedly asked him, saying, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?” 65 And they were saying many other things against him, reviling him. 66 And when day came, the council of elders of the people gathered, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away to their Sanhedrin, 67 saying, “If you are the Christ, tell us!” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you will never believe, 68 and if I ask you, you will never answer! 69 But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.” 70 So they all said, “Are you then the Son of God?” And he said to them, “You say that I am.” 71 And they said, “Why do we have need of further testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his mouth!” 1 And the whole assembly of them rose up and brought him before Pilate. 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, “We have found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying he himself is Christ, a king!” 3 And Pilate asked him, saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And he answered him and said, “You say so.” 4 So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for an accusation against this man.” 5 But they insisted, saying, “He incites the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea and beginning from Galilee as far as here.” 6 Now when Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean. 7 And when he found out that he was from the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him over to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days. 8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see some miracle performed by him. 9 So he questioned him at considerable length, but he answered nothing to him. 10 And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there vehemently accusing him. 11 And Herod with his soldiers also treated him with contempt, and after mocking him and dressing him in glistening clothing, he sent him back to Pilate. 12 And both Herod and Pilate became friends with one another on that same day, for they had previously been enemies of one another. 13 So Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people 14 and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people, and behold, when I examined him before you, I found nothing in this man as basis for the accusation which you are making against him. 15 But neither did Herod, because he sent him back to us. And behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him. 16 Therefore I will punish him and release him.” 18 But they all cried out in unison, saying, “Take this man away, and release for us Barabbas!” 19 (who had been thrown in prison because of a certain insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder). 20 And Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again, 21 but they kept crying out, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!” 22 So he said to them a third time, “Why? What wrong has this man done? I found no basis for an accusation deserving death in him. Therefore I will punish him and release him.” 23 But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he be crucified. And their cries prevailed. 24 And Pilate decided that their demand should be granted. 25 And he released the one who had been thrown into prison because of insurrection and murder, whom they were asking for, but Jesus he handed over to their will. 26 And as they led him away, they seized Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and placed the cross on him, to carry it behind Jesus. 27 And a great crowd of the people were following him, and of women who were mourning and lamenting him. 28 But turning to them, Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children! 29 For behold, days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that did not give birth, and the breasts that did not nurse!’ 30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’ 31 For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?” 32 And two other criminals were also led away to be executed with him. 33 And when they came to the place that is called “The Skull,” there they crucified him, and the criminals, the one on his right and the other on his left. 34 ?But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”? And they cast lots to divide his clothes. 35 And the people stood there watching, but the rulers also ridiculed him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if this man is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!” 36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine 37 and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!” 38 And there was also an inscription over him, “This is the king of the Jews.” 39 And one of the criminals who were hanged there reviled him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself—and us!” 40 But the other answered and rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, because you are undergoing the same condemnation? 41 And we indeed justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we have done. But this man has done nothing wrong!” 42 And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!” 43 And he said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.” ",Luke 22:63-23:43,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/luke-22632343-256061/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-01-30_luke-22632343_20120125134258.mp3
Luke,"44 And by this time it was about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour 45 because the light of the sun failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn apart down the middle. 46 And Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit!” And after he said this, he expired. 47 Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he began to praise God, saying, “Certainly this man was righteous!” 48 And all the crowds that had come together for this spectacle, when they saw the things that had happened, returned home beating their breasts. 49 And all his acquaintances, and the women who had followed him from Galilee who saw these things, stood at a distance. 50 And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man 51 (this man was not consenting to their plan and deed), from Arimathea, a Judean town, who was looking forward to the kingdom of God. 52 This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 53 And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth and placed him in a tomb cut into the rock where no one had ever been placed. 54 And it was the day of preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. 55 And the women who had been accompanying him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was placed. 56 And they returned and prepared fragrant spices and perfumes, and on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment. 1 Now on the first day of the week, at very early dawn, they came back to the tomb bringing the fragrant spices which they had prepared. 2 And they found the stone had been rolled away from the tomb, 3 but when they went in, they did not find the body. 4 And it happened that while they were perplexed about this, behold, two men in gleaming clothing stood near them. 5 And as they were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, “Why are you looking for the living among the dead? 6 He is not here, but has been raised!

Luke,"7 saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of men who are sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise?” 8 And they remembered his words, 9 and when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. 10 Now Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the others with them were telling these things to the apostles. 11 And these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they refused to believe them. 12 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb, and bending over to look, he saw only the strips of linen cloth, and he went away to his home wondering what had happened. 13 And behold, on that same day, two of them were traveling to a village named Emmaus that was sixty stadia distant from Jerusalem, 14 and they were conversing with one another about all these things that had happened. 15 And it happened that while they were conversing, and discussing, Jesus himself also approached and began to go along with them, 16 but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him. 17 And he said to them, “What are these matters that you are discussing with one another as you are walking along?” And they stood still, looking sad. 18 And one of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to him, “Are you the only one living near Jerusalem and not knowing the things that have happened in it in these days?” 19 And he said to them, “What things?” So they said to him, “The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, a man who was a prophet, powerful in deed and word before God and all the people, 20 and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to a sentence of death, and crucified him. 21 But we were hoping that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. But in addition to all these things, this is the third day since these things took place. 22 But also some women from among us astonished us, who were at the tomb early in the morning, 23 and when they did not find his body, they came back saying they had seen even a vision of angels, who said that he was alive! 24 And some of those with us went out to the tomb and found it like this, just as the women had also said, but him they did not see.” 25 And he said to them, “O foolish and slow in heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! 26 Was it not necessary that the Christ suffer these things and enter into his glory?” 27 And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures. 28 And they drew near to the village where they were going, and he acted as though he was going farther. 29 And they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, because it is getting toward evening, and by this time the day is far spent.” And he went in to stay with them. 30 And it happened that when he reclined at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks, and after breaking it, he gave it to them. 31 And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he became invisible to them. 32 And they said to one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was speaking with us on the road, while he was explaining the scriptures to us?” 33 And they got up that same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven and those with them assembled, 34 saying, “The Lord has really been raised, and has appeared to Simon!” 35 And they began describing what happened on the road, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread. 36 And while they were saying these things, he himself stood there among them. 37 But they were startled and became terrified, and thought they had seen a ghost. 38 And he said to them, “Why are you frightened? And for what reason do doubts arise in your hearts? 39 Look at my hands and my feet, that I am I myself! Touch me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.” 40 And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 41 And while they were still disbelieving because of joy and were marveling, he said to them, “Do you have anything to eat here?” 42 So they gave him a piece of broiled fish, 43 and he took it and ate it in front of them. 44 And he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything that is written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.” 45 Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures, 46 and said to them, “Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day, 47 and repentance and the forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. 48 You are witnesses of these things. 49 And behold, I am sending out what was promised by my Father upon you, but you stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.” 50 And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them. 51 And it happened that while he was blessing them, he parted from them and was taken up into heaven. 52 And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. 53 And they were continually in the temple courts praising God.

it belongs to the priest who sprinkles the fellowship offerings’ blood. 15 And the meat of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving fellowship offerings must be eaten on the day of his offering; he must not leave it until morning. 16 “ ‘But if his sacrifice is for a vow or as a freewill offering, it must be eaten on the day of his presenting his sacrifice, and on the next day the remainder from it may be eaten, 17 but the remainder from the sacrifice’s meat must be burned up in the fire on the third day. 18 And if indeed some of the meat of his fellowship offerings’ sacrifice is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted; it will not be considered of benefit for the one who presented it—it shall be unclean meat, and the person who eats it shall bear his guilt. 19 And the meat that touches anything unclean must not be eaten; it must be burned with fire, and as for the clean meat, anyone who is clean may eat the meat. 20 And the person who eats meat from the fellowship offerings’ sacrifice, which is for Yahweh, and whose uncleanness is upon him—that person shall be cut off from his people. 21 And when a person touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness or an unclean animal or any unclean detestable thing, and he eats from the meat of the fellowship offerings’ sacrifice, which is for Yahweh, then that person shall be cut off from his people.’ ” 22 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 23 “Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘You must not eat any fat of ox, or sheep, or goat; 24 and a dead body’s fat or mangled carcass’s fat may be used for any purpose, but you certainly must not eat it. 25 When anyone eats fat from the domestic animal from which he presented an offering made by fire for Yahweh, then that person who ate shall be cut off from his people. 26 And in any of your dwellings, you must not eat any blood belonging to birds or domestic animals. 27 Any person who eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.’ ” 28 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 29 “Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘The one who presents his fellowship offerings’ sacrifice for Yahweh shall bring his offering to Yahweh from his fellowship offerings’ sacrifice. 30 His own hands must bring Yahweh’s offerings made by fire. He must bring the fat in addition to the breast section to wave the breast section as a wave offering before Yahweh, 31 and the priest shall turn the fat into smoke on the altar, and the breast section shall be for Aaron and his sons. 32 And the right upper thigh you must give as a contribution for the priest from your fellowship offerings’ sacrifice. 33 As for the one from Aaron’s sons who presents the blood of the fellowship offerings and the fat, the right upper thigh shall belong to him as his share, 34 because I have taken the wave offering’s breast section and the contribution offering’s upper thigh from the Israelites out of their fellowship offerings’ sacrifices, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons from the Israelites as a lasting rule.’ ” 35 This is Aaron’s allotted portion and his sons’ allotted portion from Yahweh’s offerings made by fire when he brought them forward to serve as priests for Yahweh. 36 This is what Yahweh commanded to give them from the Israelites on the day of his anointing them; it is a lasting statute for their generations. 37 This is the regulation for the burnt offering, for the grain offering and for the sin offering and for the guilt offering and for the consecration offering and for the fellowship offerings’ sacrifice, 38 which Yahweh commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day of his commanding the Israelites to present their offerings to Yahweh in the desert of Sinai.

Leviticus,"1 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of the unleavened bread, 3 and summon all of the community to the entrance to the tent of assembly.” 4 So Moses did just as Yahweh commanded him, and the community gathered by the entrance to the tent of assembly. 5 Then Moses said to the community, “This is the word that Yahweh has commanded to be done.” 6 So Moses brought Aaron and his sons near, and he washed them with water. 7 Then he put the tunic on him and tied the sash around him; then he clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him; then he tied the ephod’s waistband around him and fastened the ephod to him with it. 8 Then he placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and the Thummim into the breastpiece; 9 and he placed the turban on his head, and on the front of the turban he placed the gold rosette, the holy diadem, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 10 Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and he consecrated them. 11 And he spattered part of it on the altar seven times—thus he anointed the altar and all of its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them. 12 Then he poured out part of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head—thus he anointed him in order to consecrate him. 13 Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons near and clothed them with tunics and tied a sash around each one, and he bound headbands on them, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

Leviticus,"14 Then he brought forth the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering, 15 and he slaughtered it, and Moses took the blood and put it with his finger on the altar’s horns all around and purified the altar; then he poured the blood out on the altar’s base—thus he consecrated it in order to make atonement for it. 16 Then he took all the fat that was on the inner parts and the lobe on the liver and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses turned them into smoke on the altar, 17 but he burned the bull and its skin and its meat and its offal in the fire outside the camp, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 18 Then he brought the ram of the burnt offering near, and Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the ram’s head, 19 and he slaughtered it. Then Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar all around. 20 Then he cut the ram into pieces, and Moses turned into smoke the head and the pieces and the suet, 21 but he washed the inner parts and the lower leg bones with water, and Moses turned into smoke all of the ram on the altar; it was a burnt offering as an appeasing fragrance, an offering made by fire for Yahweh, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 22 Then he brought the second ram near, the ram of the consecration, and Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the ram’s head, 23 and he slaughtered it. Then Moses took some of its blood and put it on Aaron’s right ear lobe and on his right hand’s thumb and on his right foot’s big toe. 24 Then he brought Aaron’s sons near, and Moses put some of the blood on their right ear lobe and on their right hand’s thumb and on their right foot’s big toe, and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar all around. 25 Then he took the fat and the fat tail and all of the fat that was on the inner parts and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right upper thigh; 26 and from the basket of the unleavened bread that was before Yahweh he took one ring-shaped unleavened bread and one ring-shaped bread with oil and one wafer, and he placed them on the fat parts and on the right upper thigh. 27 Then he put all of these on Aaron’s palms and on his sons’ palms, and he waved them as a wave offering before Yahweh. 28 Then Moses took them from upon their palms, and he turned them into smoke upon the burnt offering on the altar; they were a consecration offering as an appeasing fragrance—it was an offering made by fire for Yahweh. 29 Then Moses took the breast section, and he waved it as a wave offering before Yahweh from the ram of the consecration offering; it was Moses’ share, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 30 Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar, and he spattered them on Aaron, on his garments, and on Aaron’s sons and on his sons’ garments with him—thus he consecrated Aaron, his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him. 31 Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat in the entrance to the tent of assembly, and there you must eat it and the bread that is in the basket of the consecration offering, just as I have commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons must eat it,’ 32 but the remainder of the meat and the bread you must burn in the fire. 33 And you must not go out from the entrance to the tent of assembly for seven days, until the day of fulfilling the days of your consecration, because it will take seven days to ordain you. 34 Just as was done on this day, Yahweh commanded to be done in order to make atonement for you. 35 And you must stay at the entrance to the tent of assembly day and night for seven days, and you shall keep the obligation from Yahweh, so you might not die, for thus I have been commanded.” 36 So Aaron and his sons did all the things that Yahweh had commanded through Moses. 1 Then on the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and Israel’s elders, 2 and he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a bull calf as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, without defect, and present them before Yahweh. 3 Then you must speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘Take a he-goat as a sin offering and a bull calf and a male sheep, yearlings without defect, as a burnt offering, 4 and an ox and a ram as fellowship offerings to sacrifice before Yahweh, and a grain offering mixed with oil, because today Yahweh will appear to you.” 5 So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of assembly, and the whole community presented themselves, and they stood before Yahweh. 6 Then Moses said, “This is the word that Yahweh commanded you to do so that the glory of Yahweh might appear to you.” 7 Then Moses said to Aaron, “Approach the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. And sacrifice the people’s offering and make atonement for them, just as Yahweh has commanded.” 8 Then Aaron approached the altar, and he slaughtered the bull calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. 9 Then Aaron’s sons presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and he put it on the altar’s horns, and he poured out the blood on the altar’s base. 10 And the fat and the kidneys and the lobe from the sin offering’s liver he turned into smoke on the altar, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses, 11 but the meat and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp. 12 Then he slaughtered the burnt offering, and Aaron’s sons brought the blood to him, and he sprinkled it on the altar all around; 13 and they brought the burnt offering to him by its pieces, as well as the head, and he turned them into smoke on the altar; 14 and he washed the inner parts and the lower leg bones, then he turned them into smoke upon the burnt offering on the altar. 15 Then he presented the people’s offering, and he took the goat of the sin offering, which was for the people, and he slaughtered it and offered it as a sin offering like the first one. 16 Then he presented the burnt offering, and he sacrificed it according to the regulation. 17 Then he presented the grain offering, and he filled his palm with some of it, and he turned it into smoke on the altar besides the morning’s burnt offering. 18 Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the fellowship offerings that are for the people, and Aaron’s sons brought the blood to him, and he sprinkled it on the altar all around. 19 And as for the fat portions from the ox and from the ram (the fat tail and the layer of fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver), 20 they placed the fat portions on the breast sections, and he turned the fat portions into smoke on the altar. 21 Then Aaron waved the breast sections and the right upper thigh as a wave offering before Yahweh, just as Moses had commanded. 22 Then Aaron lifted his hand toward the people, and he blessed them, and he came down after sacrificing the sin offering and the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings. 23 Then Moses and Aaron entered the tent of assembly. When they came out, they blessed the people, and Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the people. 24 Then a fire went out from before Yahweh, and it consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And all the people saw it, so they shouted for joy, and they fell on their faces.

Leviticus,"1 And Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu each took his censer, and they put fire in them and placed incense on it; then they presented before Yahweh illegitimate fire, which he had not commanded them. 2 So fire went out from before Yahweh, and it consumed them so that they died before Yahweh. 3 Therefore Moses said to Aaron, “This is what Yahweh spoke, saying, ‘Among those who are close to me I will show myself holy, and in the presence of all the people I will display my glory.’ ” So Aaron was silent. 4 Then Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan the sons of Uzziel, Aaron’s uncle, and he said to them, “Come forward. Carry your brothers from the front of the sanctuary to outside the camp.” 5 So they came forward, and they carried them outside the camp in their tunics, just as Moses had ordered. 6 Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “You must not let your hair hang loosely, and you must not tear your garments, so that you will not die and he will be angry with all the community. But your brothers, all the house of Israel, may weep because of the burning that Yahweh caused, 7 but you must not go out from the entrance to the tent of assembly lest you die, because Yahweh’s anointing oil is on you.” So they did according to Moses’ word. 8 Then Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying, 9 “You and your sons with you may not drink wine or strong drink when you come to the tent of assembly, so that you will not die—it is a lasting statute for your generations— 10 and to distinguish between the holy and the unholy, as well as between the unclean and the clean, 11 and to teach the Israelites all the rules that Yahweh has spoken to them through Moses.” 12 Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “As for the remaining parts, take the remainder of the grain offering from Yahweh’s offerings made by fire and eat it, the unleavened bread, beside the altar, because it is a most holy thing. 13 And you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your allotted portion and the allotted portion of your sons from Yahweh’s offerings made by fire, for so I have been commanded. 14 And the wave offering’s breast section and the upper thigh of the contribution offering you must eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, because they are given as your allotted portion and your sons’ allotted portion from the sacrifices of the Israelites’ fellowship offerings. 15 They must bring the thigh of the contribution offering and the breast section of the wave offering in addition to the offerings made by fire, consisting of the fat portions, to wave as a wave offering before Yahweh; and it will be for you and for your sons with you as a lasting rule, just as Yahweh had commanded.” 16 Then Moses sought all over for the goat of the sin offering and behold, it was burned up. So he was angry with Aaron’s remaining sons Eleazar and Ithamar, saying, 17 “Why did you not eat the sin offering on the sanctuary’s site, because it is a most holy thing? And he gave it to you to remove the community’s guilt, to make atonement for them before Yahweh. 18 Look, its blood was not brought inside the sanctuary. Certainly you should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.” 19 So Aaron said to Moses, “Look, today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before Yahweh, and things such as these have happened to me, and if I were to eat a sin offering today, would it have been good in Yahweh’s eyes?” 20 When Moses heard, it was good in his eyes.

5 and the coney, because it is a chewer of cud but it does not have a hoof that is divided—it is unclean for you; 6 and the hare, because it is a chewer of cud but it does not have a hoof that is divided—it is unclean for you; 7 and the pig, because it has a divided hoof and has a split cleft in the hoof but it does not chew cud—it is unclean for you. 8 You must not eat from their meat, and you must not touch their dead body—they are unclean for you. 9 “ ‘These you may eat from all that are in the water: any in the water that has a fin and scales, whether in the seas or in the streams—such you may eat. 10 But any that does not have a fin and scales, whether in the seas or in the streams, among all the water’s swarmers among all the living creatures that are in the water—they are a detestable thing to you. 11 And they shall be detestable to you;

it is an infectious skin disease of the head or the beard. 31 But if the priest examines the diseased area of the skin’s infection and if its appearance is not deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall confine the afflicted person with the diseased area of skin for seven days. 32 And the priest shall examine the infection on the seventh day, and if the diseased area of skin has not spread and it does not have bright red hair in it and the diseased area of the skin’s appearance is not deeper than the skin, 33 then he shall shave himself, but he shall not shave the diseased area of skin, and the priest shall confine the person with the diseased area of skin a second time for seven days. 34 And the priest shall examine the diseased area of skin on the seventh day, and if the diseased area has not spread on the skin and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean, and he shall wash his garments, and he shall be clean. 35 But if the diseased area of skin has not spread further on the skin after his cleansing, 36 then the priest shall examine him, and if the diseased area of skin has spread on the skin, the priest shall not inspect for bright red hair—he is unclean. 37 But if, in his eyes, the diseased area of skin has stayed unchanged and black hair has grown in it, the diseased area of skin is healed—he is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean. 38 “And when a man or a woman has spots on their body’s skin, white spots, 39 then the priest shall examine them, and if the spots on their body’s skin are a faded white, it is a skin rash; it has broken out on the skin—it is clean. 40 “And if a man becomes bald, his head is bald, he is clean. 41 And if he becomes bald from his forehead, his head is bald, he is clean. 42 But if a pinkish infection occurs on the bald spot or on the bald forehead, it is an infectious skin disease that sprouts on his bald spot or on his bald forehead. 43 So the priest shall examine him, and if the infection’s swelling is pinkish on his bald spot or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of an infectious skin disease on the body, 44 he is a man afflicted with a skin disease—he is unclean; the priest certainly shall declare him unclean—his infection is on his head. 45 “As for the person who is afflicted with a skin disease, his garments must be torn and his hair must be allowed to hang loosely, and he must cover his upper lip, and he must call out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’ 46 For all the days during which the infection is on him, he shall be unclean; he must live alone; his dwelling must be outside the camp.” 47 “And when the garment has an infectious skin disease on it, on a wool garment or on a linen garment, 48 or on woven material or on a linen fabric, or on wool or on leather or on any work of leather, 49 and if the infection is yellowish green or reddish on the garment or on the leather or on the woven material or on the fabric or on any leather object, it is an infectious skin disease and it shall be shown to the priest. 50 And the priest shall examine the infection, and he shall confine the infected article for seven days. 51 And he shall examine the infection on the seventh day; if the infection has spread on the garment or on the woven material or on the fabric or on the leather, for any work for which the leather is used, the infection is a destructive skin disease—it is unclean. 52 And he shall burn the garment or the woven material or the fabric, whether wool or linen, or any leather object that has the infection, because it is an infectious skin disease, which is destructive—it must be burned in the fire. 53 “But if the priest examines it and if the infection has not spread on the garment or on the woven material or on the fabric or on any leather object, 54 then the priest shall command, and someone shall wash that on which the infection is, and he shall confine it a second time for seven days. 55 And the priest shall examine it after the infection has been washed off, and if the infection has not changed its outward appearance and the infection has not spread, it is unclean; he must burn it in the fire; it is a fungus on its back or on its front. 56 But if the priest examines it and if the infection is faded after it has been washed off, then he shall tear it from the garment or from the leather or from the woven material or from the fabric. 57 And if it appears again on the garment or on the woven material or on the fabric or on any leather object, it is spreading; you must burn in the fire that which has the infection in it. 58 And the garment or the woven material or the fabric or any leather object that he might wash and the infection is removed from them then shall be washed a second time, and it shall be clean.” 59 This is the regulation of the infectious skin disease in the wool garment or the linen or the woven material or the fabric or any leather object to declare it clean or to declare it unclean.

Leviticus,"1 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “This is the regulation of the person afflicted with a skin disease at the time of his cleansing. And he shall be brought to the priest, 3 and the priest shall go outside the camp, and the priest shall examine him, and if the skin disease’s infection is healed on the afflicted person, 4 then the priest shall command, and he shall take two living, clean birds and cedar wood and a crimson thread and hyssop for the one who presents himself for cleansing. 5 Then the priest shall command someone to slaughter one bird over fresh water in a clay vessel. 6 He must take the living bird and the cedar wood and the crimson thread and the hyssop, and he shall dip them and the living bird in the bird’s blood slaughtered over the fresh water. 7 And he shall spatter the blood seven times on the one who presents himself for cleansing from the infectious skin disease, and he shall declare him clean, and he shall send the living bird into the open field. 8 Then the one who presents himself for cleansing shall wash his garments, and he shall shave off all his hair, and he shall wash himself in the water; thus he shall be clean, and afterward he shall enter the camp, but he shall stay outside his tent for seven days. 9 And then on the seventh day he must shave off all his hair—he must shave his head and his beard and his eyebrows and all the rest of his hair—and he shall wash his garments, and he shall wash his body in the water; thus he shall be clean. 10 “And on the eighth day he must take two male lambs without defect and one ewe-lamb in its first year without defect and three-tenths of an ephah of finely milled flour mixed with oil as a grain offering and one log of oil. 11 And the priest who cleanses him shall present the man who presents himself for cleansing and these things before Yahweh at the entrance of the tent of assembly. 12 Then the priest shall take the one male lamb, and he shall present it as a guilt offering, and the log of oil, and he shall wave them as a wave offering before Yahweh. 13 And he shall slaughter the male lamb in the place where he slaughters the sin offering and the burnt offering in the sanctuary’s space, because as the sin offering belongs to the priest, so also the guilt offering—it is a most holy thing. 14 And the priest shall take some of the guilt offering’s blood, and the priest shall put it on the right ear’s lobe of the one who presents himself for cleansing and on his right hand’s thumb and on his right foot’s big toe. 15 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and he shall pour it on his left palm; 16 and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is on his left palm, and he shall spatter some of the oil with his finger seven times before Yahweh. 17 Then the priest shall put some of the remaining oil, which is on his palm, on the right ear’s lobe of the one to be cleansed and on his right hand’s thumb and on his right foot’s big toe, on top of the guilt offering’s blood. 18 And the remaining oil that is on the priest’s palm he shall put on the head of the one who presents himself for cleansing, and the priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh. 19 Thus the priest shall sacrifice the sin offering, and he shall make atonement for the one who presents himself for cleansing from his uncleanness, and afterward he shall slaughter the burnt offering. 20 Then the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar, and the priest shall make atonement for him, and so he shall be clean. 21 “But if he is poor and he cannot afford it, then he shall take one male lamb for a guilt offering as a wave offering to make atonement for himself and one-tenth of an ephah of finely milled flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and a log of oil, 22 and two turtledoves or two young doves that he can afford, and one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering. 23 And he shall bring them to the priest at the tent of assembly’s entrance before Yahweh on the eighth day for his cleansing. 24 And the priest shall take the male lamb for the guilt offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before Yahweh; 25 and he shall slaughter the male lamb of the guilt offering, and the priest shall take some of the guilt offering’s blood, and he shall put it on the right ear’s lobe of the one who presents himself for cleansing and on his right hand’s thumb and on his right foot’s big toe. 26 Then the priest shall pour out some of the oil on his own left palm, 27 and with his right finger the priest shall spatter some of the oil that is on his left palm seven times before Yahweh. 28 Then the priest shall put some of the oil that is on his palm on the right ear’s lobe of the one who presents himself for cleansing and on his right hand’s thumb and on his right foot’s big toe on the place of the guilt offering’s blood. 29 And the remaining oil that is on the priest’s palm he shall put on the head of the one who presents himself for cleansing to make atonement for him before Yahweh. 30 And he shall sacrifice one of the turtledoves or the young doves that he can afford, 31 even what he can afford, the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering in addition to the grain offering, and the priest shall make atonement for the one who presents himself for cleansing before Yahweh. 32 This is the regulation of the one on whom is an infectious skin disease who cannot afford the cost for his cleansing.” 33 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 34 “When you come into the land of Canaan, which I am about to give to you as your possession, and I put mildew in a house in the land of your possession, 35 then the one who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, ‘It appears to me that an infection is in the house.’ 36 And the priest shall issue a command, and they shall clear out the house before the priest comes to examine the infection, so that all that is in the house might not become unclean; and afterward the priest shall go to examine the house. 37 And he shall examine the infection, and if the infection on the house’s wall has yellowish-green or reddish spots and its appearance is deeper than the surface of the wall, 38 then the priest shall go out from the house to the house’s entrance, and he shall confine the house for seven days. 39 And the priest shall return on the seventh day, and he shall examine the infection, and if the infection has spread on the house’s wall, 40 the priest shall issue a command and they shall remove the stones on which is the infection, and they shall throw them outside the city on an unclean place. 41 Then they shall scrape off the plaster from all around the house, and they shall pour out the plaster, which they scraped off, outside the city on an unclean place. 42 And they shall take other stones, and they shall put them in place of those stones, and they shall take other plaster, and they shall replaster the house. 43 “But if the infection should return and it breaks out in the house after they have removed the stones and after scraping off the plaster of the house and after it has been replastered, 44 then the priest shall come, and he shall examine the infection, and if the infection has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew in the house—it is unclean. 45 So he shall break down the house, its stones and its wood and all of the house’s plaster, and he shall bring it all outside the city to an unclean place. 46 And the person who enters into the house during all the days that he confined it shall become unclean until the evening. 47 And the person who sleeps in the house must wash his garments, and the person who eats in the house shall wash his garments. 48 “And if the priest comes again and examines the house and if the infection has not spread in the house after being replastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the infection is healed. 49 And he shall take two birds and cedar wood and a crimson thread and hyssop to cleanse the house; 50 and he shall slaughter the first bird over fresh water on a clay vessel. 51 Then he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the crimson thread and the living bird, and he shall dip them in the slaughtered bird’s blood and in the fresh water, and he shall spatter them on the house seven times. 52 Thus he shall purify the house with the bird’s blood and with the fresh water and with the living bird and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop and with the crimson thread. 53 And he shall send the living bird outside the city into the open field; and so he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean. 54 “This is the instruction for any infectious skin disease and for the diseased area of skin, 55 and for a mildew of the garment and for the house, 56 and for the swelling and for the epidermal eruption and for the spot, 57 to teach when something is unclean and when something is clean.

Leviticus,"1 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 2 “Speak to the Israelites, and you shall say to them, ‘Any man when a fluid discharge occurs from his body, his fluid discharge is unclean. 3 And this becomes his uncleanness in his fluid discharge: whether his body secretes his fluid discharge or his body blocks his fluid discharge, it is his uncleanness. 4 Any bed upon which the person who discharges lies down becomes unclean, and any object upon which he sits becomes unclean. 5 And anyone who touches his bed must wash his garments and shall wash himself with water, and he shall be unclean until evening. 6 And the person who sits on the object upon which the person who discharges has sat must wash his garments, and he shall wash himself with water, and he shall be unclean until the evening. 7 And the person who touches the body of the person who discharges must wash his garments, and he shall wash himself with water, and he shall be unclean until the evening. 8 And if the person who discharges spits on one who is clean, then that one shall wash is garments, and he shall wash himself with water, and he shall be unclean until the evening. 9 And any saddle upon which the person who discharges rides becomes unclean. 10 And any person who touches anything that happened to be under him becomes unclean until the evening, and the person who carries them must wash his garments, and he shall wash himself with water, and he shall be unclean until the evening. 11 And anyone whom the person who discharges might touch without rinsing off his hands with water shall wash his garments, and he shall wash himself with water, and he shall be unclean until the evening. 12 But a clay vessel that the person who discharges touches must be broken, and any wood object must be rinsed with water. 13 “ ‘And when the person who discharges becomes clean from his body fluid discharge, he shall count for himself seven days for his cleansing; then he shall wash his garments, and he shall wash his body with fresh water, and he shall be clean. 14 Then on the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young doves, and he shall come before Yahweh at the tent of assembly’s entrance, and he shall give them to the priest. 15 And the priest shall sacrifice one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and so the priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh from his body fluid discharge.

Leviticus,"1 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Command the Israelites that they should bring to you pure olive oil from beaten olives for the light to present a lamp continually. 3 Aaron shall arrange for it outside the curtain of the testimony in the tent of assembly from evening until morning before Yahweh continually; it shall be a lasting statute throughout your generations. 4 On the pure golden lampstand he shall arrange for the lamps before Yahweh continually. 5 “And you shall take finely milled flour, and you shall bake with it twelve ring-shaped bread cakes: each one shall be two-tenths of an ephah. 6 And you shall place them in two rows, six to the row, on the pure gold table before Yahweh. 7 And you shall put pure frankincense on each row so that it shall be for the bread as a memorial offering, an offering made by fire for Yahweh. 8 On every Sabbath he shall arrange it in rows before Yahweh continually; they are from the Israelites as an everlasting covenant. 9 And it shall be for Aaron and for his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place, because it is a most holy thing for him from Yahweh’s offerings made by fire—a lasting rule.” 10 And an Israelite woman’s son, and he was an Egyptian man’s son, went out in the midst of the Israelites; and the Israelite woman’s son and an Israelite man fought in the camp. 11 Then the Israelite woman’s son blasphemed the name, and he cursed, so they brought him to Moses—and the name of his mother was Shelomith the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. 12 Then they put him in custody so that the matter might be made clear to them in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh. 13 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 14 “Bring the curser outside the camp, and all the hearers shall place their hands on his head, and the whole community shall stone him. 15 And you shall speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘Any man when he curses his God shall bear his sin. 16 And he who blasphemes Yahweh’s name certainly shall be put to death; the whole community certainly shall stone him. As the alien, so the native shall be put to death at blaspheming his name. 17 “ ‘And when a man kills any human being, he certainly shall be put to death. 18 And he who kills a domestic animal must repay for it life in place of life. 19 And when a man causes a physical defect in his fellow citizen according to what he has done, so it shall be done to him: 20 fracture in place of fracture, eye in place of eye, tooth in place of tooth—according to the physical defect he causes to the person, likewise it shall be caused to him. 21 And a killer of a domestic animal must repay for it, and a killer of a human shall be put to death. 22 You must have one norm; as for the alien, so it must be for the native, because I am Yahweh your God.’ ” 23 Thus Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they brought the curser outside the camp, and they stoned him with stones, and the Israelites did just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

Leviticus,"1 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, 2 “Speak to the Israelites, and say to them, ‘When you come into the land that I am about to give to you, then the land shall observe a Sabbath for Yahweh. 3 Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and you shall gather its yield. 4 But in the seventh year it shall be a Sabbath of complete rest for the land—a Sabbath for Yahweh; you must not sow your field, and you must not prune your vineyard. 5 You must not reap your harvest’s aftergrowth, and you must not harvest the grapes of your unpruned vines—it shall be a year of complete rest for the land. 6 And a Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you: for you and for your slave and for your slave woman and for your hired worker and for your temporary residents who are dwelling as aliens with you; 7 and all its yield shall be for your domestic animal and for the wild animal, which are in your land to eat. 8 “ ‘And you shall count for yourself seven Sabbaths of years, seven times seven years, and they shall be for you time periods of seven Sabbaths of years: forty-nine years. 9 And you shall cause a loud horn blast to be heard on the seventh month on the tenth of the month; on the Day of Atonement you shall cause a ram’s horn to be heard in all your land. 10 And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and you shall proclaim a release in the land for all its inhabitants. It is a Jubilee; it shall be for you, and you shall return. You must return—everyone to his property and everyone to his clan. 11 You shall have the fiftieth year as a Jubilee; you must not sow and you must not reap its aftergrowth, and you must not harvest its unpruned vines. 12 Because it is a Jubilee, it shall be holy to you. You must eat its produce from the field. 13 “ ‘In this Year of Jubilee each of you shall return to his property. 14 And when you sell something to your fellow citizen or you buy from your neighbor’s hand, you must not oppress one another. 15 You must buy from your fellow citizen according to the number of years after the Jubilee; he must sell to you according to the number of years of yield. 16 You must increase its price according to a greater number of years, but you must decrease its price according to a lesser number of years, because he is selling its yields to you. 17 And you must not oppress one another, but you shall revere your God, because I am Yahweh, your God. 18 “ ‘And you shall do my statutes, and you must keep my regulations, and you shall do them, so that you shall live securely on the land. 19 And the land shall give its fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and you shall live securely on it. 20 And if you should say, “What shall we eat in the seventh year, if we do not sow and we do not gather its yield?” 21 then I will command my blessing for you in the sixth year, so that it will make the yield for three years. 22 And you will sow in the eighth year, and you shall eat from the old yield; until the ninth year, until the coming of its yield, you shall eat the old yield. 23 “ ‘But the land must not be sold in perpetuity, because the land is mine, because you are aliens and temporary residents with me. 24 And in all your property’s land you must provide redemption for the land. 25 “ ‘When your brother becomes poor and he sells part of his property, then his nearest redeemer shall come, and he shall redeem the thing sold by his brother. 26 But if a man does not have a redeemer, then he prospers and he finds enough for his redemption, 27 then he shall calculate the years of its selling, and he shall refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and he shall return to his property. 28 But if his hand does not find enough to refund to him, then what he has sold shall be in the buyer’s hand until the Year of Jubilee; and it shall go out of the buyer’s hand in the Jubilee, and he shall return to his property. 29 “ ‘And if a man sells a residential house in a walled city, then it shall be his redemption until completing a year after his selling; its redemption shall last a year. 30 But if it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, then the house that is in the walled city shall belong to the buyer in perpetuity throughout his generations; it shall not go out of the buyer’s hand in the Jubilee. 31 However, village houses that have no surrounding wall shall be considered open country; there is redemption for it, and in the Jubilee it shall go out of the buyer’s hand. 32 “ ‘As for the cities of the Levites, that is, the houses in their property’s cities, it shall be a lasting redemption for the Levites. 33 And whatever anyone redeems from the Levites then must go out of the buyer’s hand in the Jubilee, including a house’s selling in his city’s property, because the houses in the cities of the Levites are their property in the midst of the Israelites. 34 But a field of their cities’ pastureland must not be sold, because it is their property for all time. 35 “ ‘And if your countryman becomes poor and if he becomes dependent on you, then you shall support him like an alien and like a temporary resident, and he shall live with you. 36 You must not take interest or usury from him, but you shall revere your God, and your countryman shall live with you. 37 You must not give your money to him with interest or give your food for profit. 38 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, to be as God for you. 39 “ ‘And if your countryman who is with you becomes poor, and he is sold to you, you shall not treat him as a slave. 40 He shall be with you like a hired worker, like a temporary resident; he shall work with you until the Year of Jubilee. 41 And he and his sons with him shall go out from you, and he shall return to his clan, and to the property of his ancestors he shall return. 42 Because they are my servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt, they shall not be sold as a slave. 43 You shall not rule over him with ruthlessness, but you shall revere your God. 44 “ ‘As for your slave and your slave woman who are yours, from the nations that are all around you, from them you may buy a slave or a slave woman. 45 And you may buy also from the children of the temporary residents who are dwelling with you as aliens and from their clan who are with you, who have children in your land; indeed, they may be as property for you. 46 And you may pass them on as an inheritance to your sons after you to take possession of as property for all time—you may let them work. But as for your countrymen, the Israelites, you shall not rule with ruthlessness over one another. 47 “ ‘And if the alien or the temporary resident who are with you prosper, but your countryman who is with him becomes poor and he is sold to an alien, a temporary resident who is with you, or to a descendant of an alien’s clan, 48 after he is sold redemption shall be for him; one of his brothers may redeem him, 49 or his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him, or one of his close relatives from his clan may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. 50 And he shall calculate with his buyer from the year of his selling himself until the Jubilee; and the value of his selling shall be according to the number of years—it shall be with him like a hired worker’s days. 51 If there are still many years, in keeping with them he shall restore his redemption in proportion to his purchase price. 52 And if there are a few years left until the Year of Jubilee, then he shall calculate for himself; he shall restore his redemption according to the number of his years. 53 He shall be with him as a yearly hired worker; he shall not rule over him with ruthlessness in your sight. 54 And if he is not redeemed by any of these ways, then he and his sons with him shall go out in the Year of Jubilee. 55 Indeed, the Israelites are servants for me; they are my servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt.

Leviticus,"1 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Speak to the Israelites, and say to them, ‘When a man makes a vow according to your proper value of persons to Yahweh, 3 if your proper value is for a male from twenty years of age up to sixty years of age, then your proper value shall be fifty shekels of money according to the sanctuary’s shekel. 4 But if it is for a female, then your proper value shall be thirty shekels. 5 And if from five years of age up to twenty years of age, then your proper value shall be twenty shekels for the male and ten shekels for the female. 6 And if from a month of age up to five years of age, then your proper value shall be five shekels of money for the male, and your proper value for the female shall be three shekels of money. 7 And if from sixty years of age and above: if a male, then your proper value shall be fifteen shekels; and for the female, ten shekels. 8 But if he is poorer than your proper value, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall set a value on him; the priest shall value him according to what the person who made a vow can afford. 9 “ ‘And if it is a domestic animal from which they present an offering for Yahweh, all that he gives from it for Yahweh shall be a holy object. 10 He shall not replace it, nor shall he exchange it, either good with bad or bad with good; and if he indeed exchanges a domestic animal with a domestic animal, then it and its substitution shall be a holy object. 11 But if it is any unclean animal from which they may not present an offering for Yahweh, then he shall present the animal before the priest. 12 And the priest shall set a value on it, either good or bad; as the priest sets your proper value, so it shall be. 13 And if he indeed wants to redeem it, then he shall add a fifth of it onto your proper value. 14 “ ‘And if a man consecrates his house as a holy object for Yahweh, then the priest shall set a value on it, either good or bad; just as the priest sets a value on it, so it shall remain. 15 But if the one who consecrates it wants to redeem his house, then he shall add a fifth of your proper value’s money onto it, and it shall be his. 16 “ ‘And if a man consecrates some of his property’s fields for Yahweh, then your proper value shall be in accordance with its seed requirements: a homer of barley seed for fifty shekels of money. 17 If he consecrates his field from the Year of Jubilee, it shall stand as your proper value. 18 But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the money for him according to the number of years that are left over until the Year of Jubilee; and it shall be deducted from your proper value. 19 And if he indeed redeems the field that is consecrated, then he shall add a fifth of your proper value’s money onto it, and it shall stand for him. 20 And if he does not redeem the field and if he sells the field to another man, it may not be redeemed again, 21 and the field shall be a holy object for Yahweh when it goes out in the Jubilee, like a devoted field; it shall be the priest’s property. 22 “ ‘And if he consecrates for Yahweh his acquired field that is not the field of his inherited possession, 23 then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your proper value until the year of the Jubilee, and he shall give your proper value on that day as a holy object for Yahweh. 24 In the Year of the Jubilee the field shall return to the one who bought it from him, to the one whose property the land is. 25 And every proper value of yours shall be in the sanctuary’s shekel—the shekel shall be twenty gerahs. 26 “ ‘However, a man shall not consecrate a firstborn among livestock, which belongs as firstborn to Yahweh; whether an ox or small livestock, it is for Yahweh. 27 And if it is among the unclean animals, then he shall ransom it according to your proper value, and he shall add a fifth of its value onto it; and if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your proper value. 28 However, anything devoted that a man has devoted to Yahweh from all that he has, from human or animal, or from the field of his property, may not be sold, and it may not be redeemed; anything devoted is a most holy thing for Yahweh. 29 Anyone devoted who is devoted from human beings cannot be ransomed—he shall surely be put to death. 30 “ ‘And any tithe of the land from the land’s seed or from the fruit of the trees is for Yahweh; it is a holy object for Yahweh. 31 And if a man indeed redeems from his tithe, he shall add a fifth of its value onto it. 32 As for every tithe of cattle or of the flock, all which crosses under the rod, the tenth shall be a holy object for Yahweh. 33 He shall not inspect between the good and the bad, and he shall not exchange it; but if he indeed exchanges it, then it and its substitution shall be a holy object—it shall not be redeemed.’ ” 34 These are the commands that Yahweh commanded Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai.

Mark,"1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 2 Just as it is written in the prophet Isaiah, “Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way, 3 the voice of one shouting in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths!’ ” 4 John was there baptizing in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 5 And all the Judean region and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 6 And John was dressed in camel’s hair and a belt made of leather around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 7 And he was preaching, saying, “One who is more powerful than I is coming after me, of whom I am not worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals. 8 I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” 9 And it happened that in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John. 10 And immediately as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being split apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. 11 And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.” 12 And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. 13 And he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him. 14 And after John had been taken into custody, Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God 15 and saying, “The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has come near.

Mark,"16 And as he was passing by along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen). 17 And Jesus said to them, “Follow me and I will make you become fishers of people.” 18 And immediately they left their nets and followed him. 19 And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, and they were in the boat mending the nets. 20 And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went away after him. 21 And they went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue. 22 And they were amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like the scribes. 23 And so then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 24 saying, “Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” 25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” 26 And after convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, the unclean spirit came out of him. 27 And they were all amazed, so that they began to discuss with one another, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.” 28 And the report about him then went out everywhere in the whole surrounding region of Galilee. 29 And so then he departed from the synagogue and came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John. 30 Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, suffering with a fever, and at once they told him about her. 31 And he came and raised her up by taking hold of her hand, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them. 32 Now when it was evening, when the sun had set, they began bringing to him all those who were sick and those who were demon-possessed. 33 And the whole town was gathered together at the door. 34 And he healed many who were sick with various diseases and expelled many demons. And he did not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. 35 And getting up early in the morning while it was very dark, he departed and went to a deserted place, and there he was praying. 36 And Simon and those who were with him searched diligently for him. 37 And they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you!” 38 And he said to them, “Let us go elsewhere, into the neighboring rural towns, so that I can preach there also, because I have come out for this very reason.” 39 And he went into all Galilee preaching in their synagogues and expelling demons. 40 And a leper came to him, entreating him and kneeling down, saying to him, “If you are willing, you are able to make me clean.” 41 And becoming angry, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, “I am willing; be made clean.” 42 And immediately the leprosy went away from him and he was made clean. 43 And warning him sternly, he sent him away at once. 44 And he said to him, “See to it that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and bring for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. 45 But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread abroad the account, so that he was no longer able to enter publicly into a town.

Mark,"1 And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it became known that he was at home. 2 And many had gathered, so that there was no longer room, not even at the door, and he was speaking the word to them. 3 And they came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them. 4 And when they were not able to bring him to him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. And after digging through, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying. 5 And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Child, your sins are forgiven.” 6 Now some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 7 “Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?” 8 And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves, said to them, “Why are you considering these things in your hearts? 9 Which is easier to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’? 10 But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—he said to the paralytic—11 “I say to you, get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.” 12 And he got up and immediately picked up his stretcher and went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!” 13 And he went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he began to teach them. 14 And as he was passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me!” And he stood up and followed him. 15 And it happened that he was dining in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many and they were following him. 16 And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, began to say to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 17 And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” 18 And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to him, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?” 19 And Jesus said to them, “The bridegroom’s attendants are not able to fast while the bridegroom is with them, are they? As long a time as they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast. 20 But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. 21 No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment. Otherwise the patch pulls away from it—the new from the old—and the tear becomes worse. 22 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine is destroyed and the wineskins too. But new wine is put into new wineskins.” 23 And it happened that he was going through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to make their way while plucking off the heads of grain.

Mark,"23 And it happened that he was going through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to make their way while plucking off the heads of grain. 24 And the Pharisees began to say to him, “Behold, why are they doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath?” 25 And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he had need and he and those who were with him were hungry—26 how he entered into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the presentation, which it is not permitted to eat (except the priests) and also gave it to those who were with him?” 27 And he said to them, “The Sabbath was established for people, and not people for the Sabbath. 28 So then, the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.” 1 And he entered into the synagogue again, and a man who had a withered hand was there. 2 And they were watching him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, in order that they could accuse him. 3 And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come into the middle.” 4 And he said to them, “Is it permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent. 5 And looking around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. 6 And the Pharisees went out immediately with the Herodians and began to conspire against him with regard to how they could destroy him. 7 And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd from Galilee followed him. And from Judea 8 and from Jerusalem and from Idumea and the other side of the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon a great crowd came to him because they heard all that he was doing. 9 And he told his disciples that a small boat should stand ready for him because of the crowd, so that they would not press upon him. 10 For he had healed many, so that all those who were suffering from diseases pressed about him in order that they could touch him. 11 And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, were falling down before him and crying out, saying, “You are the Son of God!” 12 And he warned them strictly that they should not make him known. 13 And he went up on the mountain and summoned those whom he wanted, and they came to him. 14 And he appointed twelve, so that they would be with him and so that he could send them out to preach 15 and to have authority to expel demons. 16 And he appointed the twelve. And to Simon he gave the name Peter, 17 and James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (and he gave to them the name Boanerges, that is, “Sons of Thunder”), 18 and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot, 19 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 20 And he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they were not even able to eat a meal. 21 And when his family heard this, they went out to restrain him, for they were saying, “He has lost his mind!” 22 And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul!” and “By the ruler of the demons he expels the demons!” 23 And he called them to himself and was speaking to them in parables, “How can Satan expel Satan? 24 And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand. 25 And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. 26 And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand, but is at an end! 27 But no one is able to enter into the house of a strong man and plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong man, and then he can thoroughly plunder his house. 28 “Truly I say to you that all the sins and the blasphemies will be forgiven the sons of men, however much they blaspheme. 29 But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit does not have forgiveness forever, but is guilty of an eternal sin”—30 because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.” 31 And his mother and his brothers arrived, and standing outside, they sent word to him to summon him. 32 And a crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.” 33 And he answered them and said, “Who is my mother or my brothers?” 34 And looking around at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers! 35 For whoever does the will of God, this person is my brother and sister and mother.” ",Mark 2:23-3:35,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/mark-223335-224139/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-10-20_mark-223335_20110919120900.mp3
Mark,"1 And again he began to teach beside the sea, and a very large crowd was gathered to him, so that he got into a boat and sat on the sea, and the whole crowd was at the sea on the land. 2 And he began to teach them many things in parables, and was saying to them in his teaching, 3 “Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow. 4 And it happened that while he was sowing, some seed fell on the side of the path, and the birds came and devoured it. 5 And other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up at once, because it did not have any depth of soil. 6 And when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it did not have enough root, it withered. 7 And other seed fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it, and it did not produce grain. 8 And other seed fell on the good soil, and produced grain, coming up and increasing, and it bore a crop—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much. 9 And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!” 10 And when he was alone, those around him together with the twelve began asking him about the parables. 11 And he said to them, “To you has been granted the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside everything is in parables, 12 so that ‘they may look closely and not perceive, and they may listen carefully and not understand, lest they turn and it be forgiven them.’ ” 13 And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? And how will you understand all the parables? 14 The sower sows the word. 15 And these are the ones beside the path where the word is sown, and whenever they hear it, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. 16 And these are like the ones sown on the rocky ground, who whenever they hear the word immediately receive it with joy. 17 And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Then when affliction or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away. 18 And others are the ones sown among the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear the word, 19 and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word and it becomes unproductive. 20 And those are the ones sown on the good soil, who hear the word and receive it and bear fruit—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much.” 21 And he said to them, “Surely a lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a bushel basket or under a bed, is it? Is it not so that it may be put on a lampstand? 22 For nothing is secret except so that it may be revealed, nor has become hidden except so that it will come to light. 23 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!” 24 And he said to them, “Take care what you hear! With the measure by which you measure out, it will be measured out to you, and will be added to you. 25 For whoever has, more will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.” 26 And he said, “The kingdom of God is like this: like a man scatters seed on the ground. 27 And he sleeps and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows—he does not know how. 28 By itself the soil produces a crop: first the grass, then the head of grain, then the full grain in the head. 29 But when the crop permits, he sends in the sickle right away, because the harvest has come.” 30 And he said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or by what parable can we present it? 31 It is like a mustard seed that when sown on the ground, although it is the smallest of all the seeds that are on the ground, 32 but when it is sown it grows up and becomes the largest of all the garden herbs, and sends out large branches so that the birds of the sky are able to nest in its shade.” 33 And with many parables such as these he was speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear it. 34 And he did not speak to them without a parable, but in private he explained everything to his own disciples. 35 And on that day, when it was evening, he said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side.” 36 And leaving the crowd, they took him along, as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him. 37 And a great storm of wind developed, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already being filled with water. 38 And he was in the stern sleeping on the cushion, and they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, is it not a concern to you that we are perishing?” 39 And he woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be quiet! Be silent!” And the wind abated and there was a great calm. 40 And he said to them, “Why are you fearful? Do you not yet have faith?” 41 And they were terribly frightened and began to say to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?” ",Mark 4,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/mark-4-224140/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-10-21_mark-4_20110919121012.mp3
Mark,"1 And they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes. 2 And as he was getting out of the boat, immediately from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit went to meet him, 3 who lived among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him any longer, not even with a chain, 4 because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles had been shattered. And no one was strong enough to subdue him. 5 And during every night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones. 6 And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down before him. 7 And crying out with a loud voice he said, “What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me!” 8 (For he was saying to him, “Come out of the man, unclean spirit!”) 9 And he was asking him “What is your name?” And he said to him, “My name is Legion, because we are many.” 10 And he was imploring him many times that he would not send them out of the region. 11 Now a large herd of pigs was there at the hill feeding, 12 and they implored him, saying, “Send us to the pigs so that we may enter into them.” 13 And he permitted them. And the unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs, and the herd—about two thousand—rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea. 14 And their herdsmen fled and reported it in the town and in the countryside, and they came to see what it was that had happened. 15 And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there clothed and in his right mind—the one who had had the legion—and they were afraid. 16 And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and about the pigs. 17 And they began to urge him to depart from their region. 18 And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed began to implore him that he could go with him. 19 And he did not permit him, but said to him, “Go to your home to your people and tell them all that the Lord has done for you, and that he has had mercy on you.” 20 And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him, and they were all astonished. 21 And after Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered to him, and he was beside the sea. 22 And one of the rulers of the synagogue came—Jairus by name—and when he saw him, he fell down at his feet. 23 And he was imploring him many times, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death! Come, lay your hands on her, so that she will get well and will live.” 24 And he went with him, and a large crowd was following him and pressing around him. 25 And there was a woman who was suffering from hemorrhages twelve years. 26 And she had endured many things under many physicians, and had spent all that she had and had received no help at all, but instead became worse. 27 When she heard about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind him and touched his cloak, 28 for she was saying, “If I touch just his clothing, I will be healed!” 29 And immediately her hemorrhage stopped and she realized in her body that she was healed of her suffering. 30 And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from himself, turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothing?” 31 And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing upon you, and you say ‘Who touched me?’ ” 32 And he was looking around to see the one who had done this. 33 So the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. 34 But he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be well from your suffering.” 35 While he was still speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter has died. Why trouble the Teacher further?” 36 But Jesus, ignoring what was said, told the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not be afraid—only believe!” 37 And he did not allow anyone to follow along with him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James. 38 And they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and saw a commotion, and people weeping and wailing loudly. 39 And when he entered, he said to them, “Why are you agitated and weeping? The child is not dead, but is sleeping.” 40 And they began laughing at him. But he sent them all out and took along the father and mother of the child, and those who were with him, and went in to where the child was. 41 And taking hold of the child’s hand, he said to her, “Talitha koum!” (which is translated, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”), 42 and immediately the girl stood up and began walking around (for she was twelve years old). And immediately they were utterly and completely astonished. 43 And he commanded them strictly that no one should learn of this, and said to give her something to eat.

Mark,"1 And he went out from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. 2 And when the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed, saying, “Where did this man get these things? And what is this wisdom that has been granted to this man, and the miracles such as these performed through his hands? 3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they were offended by him. 4 And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own household.” 5 And he was not able to do any miracle in that place except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. 6 And he was astonished because of their unbelief. And he was going around among the villages teaching. 7 And he summoned the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. 8 And he commanded them that they take along nothing for the journey except only a staff—no bread, no traveler’s bag, no money in their belts—9 but to put on sandals and not to wear two tunics. 10 And he said to them, “Whenever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there. 11 And whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.” 12 And they went out and proclaimed that people should repent. 13 And they were expelling many demons and anointing many sick people with olive oil and healing them. 14 And King Herod heard it, because his name had become known. And they were saying, “John, the one who baptizes, has been raised from the dead, and because of this these miraculous powers are at work in him.” 15 But others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and others were saying, “He is a prophet like one of the prophets.” 16 But when Herod heard it, he said, “John whom I beheaded—this one has been raised!” 17 For Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her. 18 For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not permitted for you to have your brother’s wife.” 19 So Herodias held a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him, and was not able to do so. 20 For Herod was afraid of John, because he knew him to be a righteous and holy man and protected him. And when he listened to him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he listened to him gladly. 21 And a suitable day came when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his courtiers and military tribunes and the most prominent men of Galilee. 22 And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced and pleased Herod and his dinner guests, the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.” 23 And he swore to her, “Anything whatever you ask me for I will give you, up to half my kingdom!” 24 And she went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” And she said, “The head of John the baptizer.” 25 And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.” 26 And although he was deeply grieved, the king, because of his oaths and dinner guests, did not want to refuse her. 27 And immediately the king sent an executioner and ordered him to bring his head. And he went and beheaded him in the prison. 28 And he brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. 29 And when his disciples heard this, they came and took away his corpse and placed it in a tomb. 30 And the apostles regathered to Jesus and reported to him everything that they had done and that they had taught. 31 And he said to them, “You yourselves come privately to an isolated place and rest for a short time.” For those who were coming and going were many, and they did not even have time to eat. 32 And they went away in the boat to an isolated place by themselves. 33 And many people saw them leaving and recognized them, and ran there together by land from all the towns, and arrived ahead of them. 34 And getting out of the boat he saw the large crowd and had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things. 35 And the hour had already become late when his disciples came up to him, saying, “The place is desolate and the hour is already late. 36 Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding farms and villages and purchase something to eat for themselves.” 37 But he answered and said to them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said to him, “Should we go and purchase bread for two hundred denarii and give it to them to eat?” 38 And he said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go look!” And when they found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.” 39 And he ordered them all to recline in groups on the green grass. 40 And they reclined in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. 41 And taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples so that they could set them before them. And he distributed the two fish to them all. 42 And they all ate and were satisfied. 43 And they picked up the broken pieces, twelve baskets full, and of the fish. 44 And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men. 45 And immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself dismissed the crowd. 46 And after he had said farewell to them, he went away to the mountain to pray. 47 And when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea and he was alone on the land. 48 And he saw them being beaten in their rowing because the wind was against them. Around the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he was wanting to pass by them. 49 But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought that it was a ghost, and they cried out. 50 For they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke with them and said to them, “Have courage, I am he! Do not be afraid!” 51 And he went up with them into the boat, and the wind abated. And they were extraordinarily astounded within themselves, 52 because they did not understand concerning the loaves, but their hearts were hardened. 53 And after they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there. 54 And as they were getting out of the boat, people recognized him immediately. 55 They ran about through that whole region and began to carry around those who were sick on stretchers, wherever they heard that he was. 56 And wherever he would go, into villages or into towns or to farms, they would put those who were sick in the marketplaces and would implore him that if they could touch even the edge of his cloak. And all those who touched it were healed.

Mark,"1 And the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered to him. 2 And they saw that some of his disciples were eating their bread with unclean—that is, unwashed—hands. 3 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands ritually, thus holding fast to the traditions of the elders. 4 And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions which they have received and hold fast to—for example, the washing of cups and pitchers and bronze kettles and dining couches.) 5 And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unclean hands?” 6 So he said to them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written, ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far, far away from me. 7 And they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ 8 Abandoning the commandment of God, you hold fast to the tradition of men.” 9 And he said to them, “You splendidly ignore the commandment of God so that you can keep your tradition. 10 For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother must certainly die.’ 11 But you say, ‘If a man says to his father or to his mother, “Whatever benefit you would have received from me is corban” (that is, a gift to God), 12 you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother, 13 thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down, and you do many similar things such as this.” 14 And summoning the crowd again, he said to them, “Listen to me, all of you, and understand: 15 There is nothing outside of a person that is able to defile him by going into him. But the things that go out of a person are the things that defile a person.” 17 And when he entered into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable. 18 And he said to them, “So are you also without understanding? Do you not understand that everything that is outside that goes into a person is not able to defile him? 19 For it does not enter into his heart but into his stomach, and goes out into the latrine”—thus declaring all foods clean. 20 And he said, “What comes out of a person, that defiles a person. 21 For from within, from the heart of people, come evil plans, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders, 22 adulteries, acts of greed, malicious deeds, deceit, licentiousness, envy, abusive speech, pride, foolishness. 23 All these evil things come from within and defile a person.” 24 And from there he set out and went to the region of Tyre. And when he entered into a house, he wanted no one to know, and yet he was not able to escape notice. 25 But immediately a woman whose young daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, when she heard about him, came and fell down at his feet, 26 Now the woman was a Greek—a Syrophoenician by nationality—and she was asking him that he would expel the demon from her daughter. 27 And he said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs!” 28 But she answered and said to him, “Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” 29 And he said to her, “Because of this statement, go! The demon has gone out of your daughter.” 30 And when she went to her home, she found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone. 31 And again he went away from the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of the Decapolis. 32 And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they were imploring him that he would place his hand on him. 33 And he took him away from the crowd by himself and put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue. 34 And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, “Ephphatha!” (that is, “Be opened!”). 35 And his ears were opened and his difficulty in speaking was removed and he began to speak normally. 36 And he ordered them that they should say nothing, but as much as he ordered them not to, they proclaimed it even more instead. 37 And they were amazed beyond all measure, saying, “He has done all things well! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!” ",Mark 7,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/mark-7-231960/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-10-26_mark-7_20111018192443.mp3
Mark,"1 In those days there was again a large crowd, and they did not have anything they could eat. Summoning the disciples, he said to them, 2 “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat. 3 And if I send them away hungry to their homes they will give out on the way, and some of them have come from far away.” 4 And his disciples answered him, “Where is anyone able to feed these people with bread here in the desert?” 5 And he asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” So they said, “Seven.” 6 And he commanded the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground, and taking the seven loaves, after he had given thanks he broke them and began giving them to his disciples so that they could set them before them. And they set them before the crowd. 7 And they had a few small fish, and after giving thanks for them, he said to set these before them also. 8 And they ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces that were left, seven baskets full. 9 Now there were about four thousand. And he sent them away. 10 And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha. 11 And the Pharisees came and began to argue with him, demanding from him a sign from heaven in order to test him. 12 And sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, “Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation!” 13 And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side. 14 And they had forgotten to take bread, and except for one loaf, they did not have any with them in the boat. 15 And he ordered them, saying, “Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod!” 16 And they began to discuss with one another that they had no bread. 17 And knowing this, he said to them, “Why are you discussing that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Have your hearts been hardened? 18 Although you have eyes, do you not see? And although you have ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember? 19 When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?” They said to him, “Twelve.” 20 “When I also broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?” And they said to him, “Seven.” 21 And he said to them, “Do you not yet understand?” 22 And they came to Bethsaida. And they brought to him a blind man and implored him that he would touch him. 23 And he took hold of the blind man’s hand and led him outside the village, and after spitting in his eyes, he placed his hands on him and asked him, “Do you see anything?” 24 And looking up he said, “I see people, for I see them like trees walking around.” 25 Then he placed his hands on his eyes again, and he opened his eyes and was cured, and could see everything clearly. 26 And he sent him to his home, saying, “Do not even go into the village.” 27 And Jesus and his disciples went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, “Who do people say that I am?” 28 And they told him, saying, “John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others that you are one of the prophets.” 29 And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered and said to him, “You are the Christ!” 30 And he warned them that they should tell no one about him. 31 And he began to teach them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise. 32 And he was speaking openly about the subject, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. 33 But turning around and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan, because you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but the things of people!” 34 And summoning the crowd together with his disciples, he said to them, “If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. 35 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me and of the gospel will save it. 36 For what does it benefit a person to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? 37 For what can a person give in exchange for his life? 38 For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.” ",Mark 8,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/mark-8-231961/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-10-27_mark-8_20111018192447.mp3
Mark,"1 And he said to them, “Truly I say to you, that there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the kingdom of God having come with power.” 2 And after six days, Jesus took along Peter and James and John, and led them to a high mountain by themselves alone. And he was transfigured before them, 3 and his clothing became radiant—extremely white, like no cloth refiner on earth can make so white. 4 And Elijah appeared to them together with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. 5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good that we are here! And let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.” 6 (For he did not know what he should answer, because they were terrified.) 7 And a cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came from the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!” 8 And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus alone. 9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, he ordered them that they should tell no one the things that they had seen, except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead. 10 And they kept the matter to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead meant. 11 And they asked him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” 12 And he said to them, “Elijah indeed does come first and restores all things. And how is it written concerning the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt? 13 But I tell you that indeed Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.” 14 And when they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes arguing with them. 15 And immediately the whole crowd, when they saw him, were amazed, and ran up to him and greeted him. 16 And he asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?” 17 And one individual from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought to you my son who has a spirit that makes him mute. 18 And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes paralyzed. And I told your disciples that they should expel it, and they were not able to do so. 19 And he answered them and said, “O unbelieving generation! How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me!” 20 And they brought him to him. And when he saw him, the spirit immediately convulsed him, and falling on the ground, he began to roll around, foaming at the mouth. 21 And he asked his father how long it was since this had been happening to him. And he said, “From childhood. 22 And often it has thrown him both into fire and into water, in order that it could destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us!” 23 But Jesus said to him, “If you are able! All things are possible for the one who believes!” 24 Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, “I believe! Help my unbelief!” 25 Now when Jesus saw that a crowd was running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and enter into him no more!” 26 And it came out, screaming and convulsing him greatly, and he became as if he were dead, so that most of them said, “He has died!” 27 But Jesus took hold of his hand and raised him up, and he stood up. 28 And after he had entered into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why were we not able to expel it?” 29 And he said to them, “This kind can come out by nothing except by prayer.” 30 And from there they went out and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know, 31 for he was teaching his disciples and was telling them, “The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.” 32 But they did not understand the statement, and they were afraid to ask him. 33 And they came to Capernaum. And after he was in the house, he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?” 34 But they were silent, because they had argued with one another on the way about who was greatest. 35 And he sat down and called the twelve and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he will be last of all and servant of all.” 36 And he took a young child and had him stand among them. And taking him in his arms, he said to them, 37 “Whoever welcomes one of the young children such as these in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me, but the one who sent me.” 38 John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone expelling demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us.” 39 But Jesus said, “Do not prevent him, because there is no one who does a miracle in my name and will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. 40 For whoever is not against us is for us. 41 For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name because you are Christ’s, truly I say to you that he will never lose his reward. 42 “And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it is better for him if instead a large millstone is placed around his neck and he is thrown into the sea. 43 And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life crippled than, having two hands, to go into hell—into the unquenchable fire! 45 And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life lame than, having two feet, to be thrown into hell! 47 And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out! It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than, having two eyes, to be thrown into hell, 48 ‘where their worm does not die and the fire is not extinguished.’ 49 For everyone will be salted with fire. 50 Salt is good, but if the salt becomes deprived of its salt content, by what can you make it salty? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with one another.” ",Mark 9,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/mark-9-231962/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-10-28_mark-9_20111018192451.mp3
Mark,"1 And from there he set out and came to the region of Judea and the other side of the Jordan, and again crowds came together to him. And again, as he was accustomed to do, he began to teach them. 2 And they asked him if it was permitted for a man to divorce his wife, in order to test him. 3 And he answered and said to them, “What did Moses command you?” 4 So they said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away.” 5 But Jesus said to them, “He wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart. 6 But from the beginning of creation ‘he made them male and female. 7 Because of this a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, 8 and the two will become one flesh,’ so that they are no longer two but one flesh. 9 Therefore what God has joined together, man must not separate.” 10 And in the house again the disciples began to ask him about this. 11 And he said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her. 12 And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.” 13 And they were bringing young children to him so that he could touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. 14 But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant, and said to them, “Let the young children come to me. Do not forbid them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 15 Truly I say to you, whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it.” 16 And after taking them into his arms, he blessed them, placing his hands on them. 17 And as he was setting out on his way, one individual ran up and knelt down before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do so that I will inherit eternal life?” 18 So Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. 19 You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.’ ” 20 And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.” 21 And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: Go, sell all that you have, and give the proceeds to the poor—and you will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me.” 22 But he looked gloomy at the statement and went away sorrowful, because he had many possessions. 23 And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it is for those who possess wealth to enter into the kingdom of God!” 24 And the disciples were astounded at his words. But Jesus answered and said to them again, “Children, how difficult it is to enter into the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God.” 26 And they were very astounded, saying to one another, “And who can be saved?” 27 Jesus looked at them and said, “With human beings it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.” 28 Peter began to say to him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you.” 29 Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields on account of me and on account of the gospel 30 who will not receive a hundred times as much now in this time—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, together with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life. 31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.” 32 Now they were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going on ahead of them. And they were astounded, but those who were following him were afraid. And taking aside the twelve again, he began to tell them the things that were about to happen to him: 33 “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles. 34 And they will mock him and spit on him and flog him and kill him, and after three days he will rise.” 35 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask you.” 36 And he said to them, “What do you want that I do for you?” 37 So they said to him, “Grant to us that we may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory.” 38 But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” 39 And they said to him, “We are able.” So Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup that I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, 40 but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but is for those for whom it has been prepared.” 41 And when they heard this, the ten began to be indignant about James and John. 42 And Jesus called them to himself and said to them, “You know that those who are considered to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their people in high positions exercise authority over them. 43 But it is not like this among you! But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 44 and whoever wants to be most prominent among you must be the slave of all. 45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” 46 And they came to Jericho. And as he was setting out from Jericho along with his disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar, Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus, was sitting beside the road. 47 And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 48 And many people warned him that he should be quiet. But he was crying out even more loudly, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 49 And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” And they called the blind man and said to him, “Have courage! Get up! He is calling you.” 50 And he threw off his cloak, jumped up, and came to Jesus. 51 And Jesus answered him and said, “What do you want me to do for you?” And the blind man said to him, “Rabboni, that I may regain my sight.” 52 And Jesus said to him, “Go, your faith has healed you.” And immediately he regained his sight and began to follow him on the road.

Mark,"1 And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples 2 and said to them, “Go into the village before you, and right away as you enter into it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it. 3 And if anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say ‘The Lord has need of it, and will send it here again at once.’ ” 4 And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it. 5 And some of those who were standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” 6 So they told them, just as Jesus had said, and they allowed them to take it. 7 And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, and he sat on it. 8 And many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches they had cut from the fields. 9 And those who went ahead and those who were following were shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! 10 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!” 11 And he went into Jerusalem to the temple, and after looking around at everything, because the hour was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve. 12 And on the next day as they were departing from Bethany, he was hungry. 13 And when he saw from a distance a fig tree that had leaves, he went to see if perhaps he would find anything on it. And when he came up to it he found nothing except leaves, because it was not the season for figs. 14 And he responded and said to it, “Let no one eat fruit from you any more forever!” And his disciples heard it. 15 And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered into the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple courts, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who were selling doves. 16 And he did not permit anyone to carry objects through the temple courts. 17 And he began to teach and was saying to them, “Is it not written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations,’ but you have made it a cave of robbers!” 18 And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and began considering how they could destroy him. For they were afraid of him because the whole crowd was astounded by his teaching. 19 And when evening came they went out of the city. 20 And as they passed by early in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. 21 And Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered!” 22 And Jesus answered and said to them, “Have faith in God! 23 Truly I say to you that whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea!’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. 24 For this reason I say to you, whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received it, and it will be done for you. 25 And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your sins.” 27 And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came up to him 28 and said to him, “By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority that you do these things?” 29 So Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question. Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 30 The baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men? Answer me!” 31 And they began to discuss this with one another, saying, “What should we say? If we say ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ 32 But if we say, ‘From men’ ”—they were afraid of the crowd, because they all looked upon John as truly a prophet. 33 And they replied to Jesus saying, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.” ",Mark 11,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/mark-11-232180/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-11-01_mark-11_20111019122305.mp3
Mark,"1 And he began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard, and put a fence around it, and dug a trough for the winepress, and built a watchtower, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey. 2 And he sent a slave to the tenant farmers at the proper time, so that he could collect some of the fruit of the vineyard from the tenant farmers. 3 And they seized him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed. 4 And again he sent to them another slave, and that one they struck on the head and dishonored. 5 And he sent another, and that one they killed. And he sent many others, some of whom they beat and some of whom they killed. 6 He had one more, a beloved son. Last of all he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ 7 But those tenant farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours!’ 8 And they seized and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard. 9 What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others. 10 Have you not read this scripture: ‘The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the cornerstone. 11 This came about from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?” 12 And they were seeking to arrest him, and they were afraid of the crowd, because they knew that he had told the parable with reference to them. And they left him and went away. 13 And they sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him so that they could catch him unawares in a statement. 14 And when they came, they said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and you do not care what anyone thinks, because you do not regard the opinion of people but teach the way of God in truth. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or should we not pay?” 15 But because he knew their hypocrisy, he said to them, “Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius so that I can look at it!” 16 So they brought one. And he said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?” And they said to him, “Caesar’s.” 17 And Jesus said to them, “Give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!” And they were utterly amazed at him. 18 And Sadducees—who say there is no resurrection—came up to him and began to ask him, saying, 19 “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if someone’s brother dies and he leaves behind a wife and does not leave a child, that his brother should take the wife and father descendants for his brother. 20 There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife. And when he died, he did not leave descendants. 21 And the second took her, and he died without leaving descendants. And the third likewise. 22 And the seven did not leave descendants. Last of all the woman also died. 23 In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife. 24 Jesus said to them, “Are you not deceived because of this, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God? 25 For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. 26 Now concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses in the passage about the bush how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’? 27 He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are very much mistaken!” 28 And one of the scribes came up and heard them debating. When he saw that he answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” 29 Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Listen, Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one. 30 And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.’ 31 The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.” 32 And the scribe said to him, “That is true, Teacher. You have said correctly that he is one and there is no other except him. 33 And to love him from your whole heart and from your whole understanding and from your whole strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.” 34 And Jesus, when he saw that he had answered thoughtfully, said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And no one dared to put a question to him any longer. 35 And continuing, Jesus said while teaching in the temple courts, “How can the scribes say that the Christ is David’s son? 36 David himself said by the Holy Spirit, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.” ’ 37 David himself calls him ‘Lord,’ and how is he his son?” And the large crowd was listening to him gladly. 38 And in his teaching he said, “Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and greetings in the marketplaces 39 and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets, 40 who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy prayers for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!” 41 And he sat down opposite the contribution box and was observing how the crowd was putting coins into the contribution box. And many rich people were putting in many coins. 42 And one poor widow came and put in two small copper coins (that is, a penny). 43 And summoning his disciples, he said to them, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all those who put offerings into the contribution box. 44 For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everything she had, her whole means of subsistence.” ",Mark 12,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/mark-12-232128/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-11-02_mark-12_20111019113100.mp3
Mark,"1 And as he was going out of the temple courts, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look! What great stones and what wonderful buildings!” 2 And Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left here on another stone that will not be thrown down!” 3 And as he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, 4 “Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?” 5 So Jesus began to say to them, “Watch out that no one deceives you! 6 Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and they will deceive many. 7 And when you hear about wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. This must happen, but the end is not yet. 8 For nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines. These things are the beginning of birth pains. 9 “But you, watch out for yourselves! They will hand you over to councils and you will be beaten in the synagogues and will have to stand before governors and kings because of me, for a witness to them. 10 And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations. 11 And when they arrest you and hand you over, do not be anxious beforehand what you should say, but whatever is given to you at that hour, say this. For you are not the ones who are speaking, but the Holy Spirit. 12 And brother will hand over brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death. 13 And you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end—this one will be saved. 14 “But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be” (let the one who reads understand), “then those in Judea must flee to the mountains! 15 The one who is on his housetop must not come down or go inside to take anything out of his house, 16 and the one who is in the field must not turn back to pick up his cloak. 17 And woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days! 18 But pray that it will not happen in winter. 19 For in those days there will be tribulation of such a kind as has not happened from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and never will happen. 20 And if the Lord had not shortened the days, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he has shortened the days. 21 “And at that time if anyone should say to you, “Behold, here is the Christ,’ ‘Behold, there he is,’ do not believe him! 22 For false messiahs and false prophets will appear, and will produce signs and wonders in order to mislead, if possible, the elect. 23 But you, watch out! I have told you everything ahead of time! 24 “But in those days, after that tribulation, ‘the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light, 25 and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.’ 26 And then they will see the Son of Man arriving in the clouds with great power and glory. 27 And then he will send out the angels, and will gather the elect together from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of heaven. 28 “Now learn the parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. 29 So also you, when you see these things happening, know that he is near, at the door. 30 Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all these things take place! 31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 32 “But concerning that day or hour no one knows—not even the angels in heaven nor the Son—except the Father. 33 Watch out! Be alert, because you do not know when the time is! 34 It is like a man away on a journey, who left his house and gave his slaves authority—to each one his work—and to the doorkeeper he gave orders that he should be on the alert. 35 Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming—whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or early in the morning—36 lest he arrive suddenly and find you sleeping. 37 And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Be on the alert!” ",Mark 13,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/mark-13-232129/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-11-03_mark-13_20111019113107.mp3
Mark,"1 Now after two days it was the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread, and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how, after arresting him by stealth, they could kill him. 2 For they said, “Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar by the people.” 3 And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining for a meal, a woman came holding an alabaster flask of very costly perfumed oil of genuine nard. After breaking the alabaster flask, she poured it out on his head. 4 But some were expressing indignation to one another: “Why has there been this waste of perfumed oil? 5 For this perfumed oil could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor!” And they began to scold her. 6 But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why do you cause trouble for her? She has done a good deed to me. 7 For the poor you always have with you, and you can do good for them whenever you want, but you do not always have me. 8 She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial. 9 And truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her. 10 And Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them. 11 And when they heard this, they were delighted, and promised to give him money. And he began seeking how he could betray him conveniently. 12 And on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare, so that you can eat the Passover?” 13 And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him, 14 and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’ 15 And he will show you a large upstairs room furnished and ready, and prepare for us there.” 16 And the disciples went out and came into the city and found everything just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover. 17 And when it was evening, he arrived with the twelve. 18 And while they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, that one of you who is eating with me will betray me.” 19 They began to be distressed and to say to him one by one, “Surely not I?” 20 But he said to them, “It is one of the twelve—the one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me. 21 For the Son of Man is going just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if that man had not been born.” ",Mark 14:1-21,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/mark-141-21-232130/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-11-04_mark-141-21_20111019113302.mp3
Mark,"22 And while they were eating, he took bread and, after giving thanks, he broke it and gave it to them and said, “Take it, this is my body.” 23 And after taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it. 24 And he said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many. 25 Truly I say to you that I will never drink of the fruit of the vine any longer until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.” 26 And after they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 27 And Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away, because it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered.’ 28 But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” 29 But Peter said to him, “Even if they all fall away, certainly I will not!” 30 And Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that today—this night—before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times!” 31 But he kept saying emphatically, “If it is necessary for me to die with you, I will never deny you!” And they all were saying the same thing also. 32 And they came to a place named Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.” 33 And he took along Peter and James and John with him, and he began to be distressed and troubled. 34 And he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake.” 35 And going forward a little he fell to the ground and began to pray that, if it were possible, the hour would pass from him. 36 And he said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible for you! Take away this cup from me! Yet not what I will, but what you will.” 37 And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? Were you not able to stay awake one hour? 38 Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak!” 39 And again he went away and prayed, saying the same thing. 40 And again he came and found them sleeping, for they could not keep their eyes open, and they did not know what to reply to him. 41 And he came the third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. 42 Get up, let us go! Behold, the one who is betraying me is approaching!” 43 And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas—one of the twelve—arrived, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. 44 Now the one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, “The one whom I kiss—he is the one. Arrest him and lead him away under guard!” 45 And when he arrived, he came up to him immediately and said, “Rabbi,” and kissed him. 46 So they laid hands on him and arrested him. 47 But a certain one of the bystanders, drawing his sword, struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear. 48 And Jesus answered and said to them, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to arrest me? 49 Every day I was with you in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me! But this has happened in order that the scriptures would be fulfilled. 50 And they all abandoned him and fled. 51 And a certain young man was following him, clothed only in a linen cloth on his naked body. And they attempted to seize him, 52 but he left behind the linen cloth and fled naked. 53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together. 54 And Peter followed him from a distance, right inside, into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with the officers and warming himself by the fire. 55 Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, and they did not find it. 56 For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony was not consistent. 57 And some stood up and began to give false testimony against him, saying, 58 “We heard him saying, ‘I will destroy this temple made by hands, and within three days I will build another not made by hands.” 59 And their testimony was not even consistent about this. 60 And the high priest stood up in the midst of them and asked Jesus, saying, “Do you not reply anything? What are these people testifying against you?” 61 But he was silent and did not reply anything. Again the high priest asked him and said to him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” 62 And Jesus said, “I am, and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.” 63 And the high priest tore his clothes and said, “What further need do we have of witnesses? 64 You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?” And they all condemned him as deserving death. 65 And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him with their fists, and to say to him “Prophesy!” And the officers received him with slaps in the face. 66 And while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the female slaves of the high priest came up 67 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked intently at him and said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.” 68 But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean!” And he went out into the gateway, and a rooster crowed. 69 And the female slave, when she saw him, began to say again to the bystanders, “This man is one of them!” 70 But he denied it again. And after a little while, again the bystanders began to say to Peter, “You really are one of them, because you also are a Galilean, and your accent shows it!” 71 And he began to curse and to swear with an oath, “I do not know this man whom you are talking about!” 72 And immediately a rooster crowed for the second time. And Peter remembered the statement, how Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times,” and throwing himself down, he began to weep.

Mark,"1 And as soon as morning came, after formulating a plan, the chief priests, with the elders and scribes and the whole Sanhedrin, tied up Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate. 2 And Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And he answered him and said, “You say so.” 3 And the chief priests began to accuse him of many things. 4 So Pilate asked him again, saying, “Do you not answer anything? See how many charges they are bringing against you!” 5 But Jesus did not answer anything further, so that Pilate was astonished. 6 Now at each feast he customarily released for them one prisoner whom they requested. 7 And the one named Barabbas was imprisoned with the rebels who had committed murder in the rebellion. 8 And the crowd came up and began to ask him to do as he customarily did for them. 9 So Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?” 10 (For he realized that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.) 11 But the chief priests incited the crowd so that he would release for them Barabbas instead. 12 So Pilate answered and said to them again, “Then what do you want me to do with the one whom you call the king of the Jews?” 13 And they shouted again, “Crucify him!” 14 And Pilate said to them, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!” 15 So Pilate, because he wanted to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas. And after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over so that he could be crucified. 16 So the soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the governor’s residence) and called together the whole cohort. 17 And they put a purple cloak on him, and after weaving a crown of thorns they placed it on him. 18 And they began to greet him, “Hail, king of the Jews!” 19 And they repeatedly struck him on the head with a reed, and were spitting on him, and they knelt down and did obeisance to him. 20 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him, and they led him out so that they could crucify him. 21 And they forced a certain man who was passing by, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), who was coming from the country, to carry his cross. 22 And they brought him to the place Golgotha (which is translated “Place of a Skull”). 23 And they attempted to give him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. 24 And they crucified him and divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots for them to see who should take what. 25 Now it was the third hour when they crucified him. 26 And the inscription of the charge against him was written, “The king of the Jews.” 27 And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. 29 And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, 30 save yourself by coming down from the cross!” 31 In the same way also the chief priests, along with the scribes, were mocking him to one another, saying, “He saved others; he is not able to save himself! 32 Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe! Even those who were crucified with him were reviling him. 33 And when the sixth hour came, darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” (which is translated, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”) 35 And some of the bystanders, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is summoning Elijah!” 36 And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Leave him alone! Let us see if Elijah is coming to take him down.” 37 But Jesus uttered a loud cry and expired.

Mark,"38 And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 39 And when the centurion who was standing opposite him saw that he expired like this, he said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!” 40 And there were also women observing from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and Joses, and Salome, 41 who used to follow him and serve him when he was in Galilee, and many other women who went up with him to Jerusalem. 42 And when it was already evening, since it was the day of preparation (that is, the day before the Sabbath), 43 Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the council who was also himself looking forward to the kingdom of God, came acting courageously and went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 44 And Pilate was surprised that he was already dead, and summoning the centurion, asked him whether he had died already. 45 And when he learned of it from the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph. 46 And after purchasing a linen cloth and taking him down, he wrapped him in the linen cloth and placed him in a tomb that had been cut from the rock. And he rolled a stone over the entrance of the tomb. 47 Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was placed. 1 And when the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome purchased fragrant spices so that they could go and anoint him. 2 And very early in the morning on the first day of the week they came to the tomb after the sun had risen. 3 And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?” 4 And when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away (for it was very large). 5 And as they were going into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. 6 But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified. He has been raised, he is not here! See the place where they laid him! 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.” 8 And they went out and fled from the tomb, because trembling and amazement had seized them. And they said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid. ?So they promptly reported all the things they had been commanded to those around Peter. And after these things, Jesus himself also sent out through them from the east even as far as the west the holy and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation. Amen.? ?9 Now early on the first day of the week, after he rose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had expelled seven demons. 10 She went out and announced it to those who were with him while they were mourning and weeping. 11 And those, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, refused to believe it. 12 And after these things, he appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking, while they were going out into the countryside. 13 And these went and reported it to the others, and they did not believe them. 14 And later, while they were reclining at table, he appeared to the eleven. And he reprimanded their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had been raised. 15 And he said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. 16 The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who refuses to believe will be condemned. 17 And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will expel demons, they will speak in new tongues, 18 they will pick up snakes. And if they drink any deadly poison it will never hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick and they will get well.” 19 Then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. 20 And they went out and proclaimed everywhere, while the Lord was working together with them and confirming the message through the accompanying signs.?

Exodus,"1 And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt; with Jacob, they each came with his family: 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 5 And all those who descended from Jacob were seventy individuals, and Joseph was in Egypt. 6 And Joseph died and all of his brothers and all of that generation. 7 And the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied and were many and were very, very numerous, and the land was filled with them. 8 And a new king rose over Egypt who did not know Joseph. 9 And he said to his people, “Look, the people of the Israelites are greater and more numerous than us. 10 Come, we must deal shrewdly with them, lest they become many, and when war happens, they also will join our enemies and will fight against us and go up from the land.” 11 And they appointed commanders of forced labor over them in order to oppress them with their forced labor, and they built storage cities for Pharaoh—Pithom and Rameses. 12 And as he oppressed them, so they became many, and so they spread out, and the Egyptians were afraid because of the presence of the Israelites. 13 And the Egyptians ruthlessly compelled the Israelites to work. 14 And they made their lives bitter with hard work with mortar and with bricks and with all sorts of work in the field—with all their work in which they ruthlessly enslaved them. 15 And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives—of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah and the name of the second was Puah—16 and he said, “When you help the Hebrews give birth, you will look upon the pairs of testicles; if he is a son, you will put him to death, and if she is a daughter, she will live.” 17 But the midwives feared God, and they did not do as the king of Egypt had said to them. They let the boys live. 18 And the king of Egypt summoned the midwives, and he said to them, “Why have you done this thing and let the boys live?” 19 And the midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, because they are vigorous; before the midwife comes to them, they have given birth.” 20 And God did the midwives good, and the Israelite people became many and were very numerous. 21 And so because the midwives feared God, he gave them families. 22 And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “Every son who is born you will throw into the Nile, and every daughter you will let live.” ",Exodus 1,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-1-204467/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-08-25_exodus-1_20110712133917.mp3
Exodus,"1 And a man from the family of Levi went, and he took a descendent of Levi. 2 And the woman conceived, and she gave birth to a son, and she saw him, that he was a fine baby, and she hid him three months. 3 But when she could no longer hide him, she got a papyrus basket for him, and she coated it with tar and with pitch, and she placed the boy in it, and she placed it among the reeds on the bank of the Nile. 4 And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him. 5 And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to wash at the Nile, while her maidservants were walking alongside the Nile, and she saw the basket in the midst of the reeds, and she sent her slave woman for it and took it 6 and opened it and saw him—the boy—and it was a lad weeping, and she had compassion for him and said, “This must be from the boys of the Hebrews.” 7 And his sister said to the daughter of Pharaoh, “Shall I go and call for you a woman from the Hebrews who is nursing so that she will nurse the boy for you?” 8 And the daughter of Pharaoh said to her, “Go.” And the girl went, and she called the mother of the boy. 9 And the daughter of Pharaoh said, “Take this boy and nurse him for me, and I myself will give you wages, and the woman took the boy, and she nursed him. 10 And the boy grew, and she brought him to the daughter of Pharaoh, and he became her son, and she called his name Moses, and she said, “Because I drew him out from the water.” 11 And then in those days when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers, and he saw their forced labor, and he saw an Egyptian man striking a Hebrew man, one of his brothers. 12 And he turned here and there, and he saw no one, and he struck the Egyptian, and he hid him in the sand. 13 And he went out on the second day, and there were two Hebrew men fighting, and he said to the guilty one, “Why do you strike your neighbor?” 14 And he said, “Who appointed you as a commander and a judge over us? Are you intending to kill me like you killed the Egyptian?” And Moses was afraid, and he said, “Surely the matter has become known.” 15 And Pharaoh heard this matter, and he sought to kill Moses, and Moses fled from Pharaoh, and he lived in the land of Midian, and he lived at a certain well. 16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. 17 And the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and came to their rescue and watered their flock. 18 And they came to Reuel, their father, and he said, “Why have you come so quickly today?” 19 And they said, “An Egyptian man delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and he even drew water for us and watered the flock.” 20 And he said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why then have you left the man? Call him so that he can eat some food.” 21 And Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses.

Exodus,"21 And Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses. 22 And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom because he said, “I am an alien in a foreign land.” 23 And then during those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the Israelites groaned because of the work, and they cried out, and their cry for help because of the work went up to God. 24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, 25 and God saw the Israelites, and God took notice. 1 And Moses was a shepherd with the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the west of the desert, and he came to the mountain of God, to Horeb. 2 And the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush, and he looked, and there was the bush burning with fire, but the bush was not being consumed. 3 And Moses said, “Let me turn aside and see this great sight. Why does the bush not burn up?” 4 And Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see, and God called to him from the midst of the bush, and he said, “Moses, Moses.” And he said, “Here I am.” 5 And he said, “You must not come near to here. Take off your sandals from on your feet, because the place on which you are standing, it is holy ground.” 6 And he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face because he was afraid of looking at God. 7 And Yahweh said, “Surely I have seen the misery of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry of distress because of their oppressors, for I know their sufferings. 8 And I have come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up from this land to a good and wide land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites.

This is my name forever, and this is my remembrance from generation to generation.’ 16 Go and gather the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, “I have carefully attended to you and what has been done to you in Egypt.” 17 And I said, “I will bring you up from the misery of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.” ’ 18 And they will listen to your voice, and you will go, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews has met with us, and now let us please go on a journey of three days into the desert, and let us sacrifice to Yahweh our God.’ 19 But I myself know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go unless compelled by a strong hand. 20 And I will stretch out my hand, and I will strike Egypt with all of my wonders that I will do in its midst, and afterward he will release you. 21 And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and then when you go, you will not go empty-handed. 22 And a woman will ask from her neighbor and from the woman dwelling as an alien in her house for objects of silver and objects of gold and garments, and you will put them on your sons and on your daughters; and you will plunder Egypt.” 1 And Moses answered, and he said, “And if they do not believe me and they do not listen to my voice, but they say, ‘Yahweh did not appear to you?’ ” 2 And Yahweh said to him, “What is this in your hand?” And he said, “A staff.” 3 And he said, “Throw it onto the ground.” And he threw it onto the ground, and it became a snake, and Moses fled from it. 4 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Reach out your hand and grasp it by its tail”—” (And he reached out his hand and grabbed it, and it became a staff in his palm.)—5 “so that they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, appeared to you, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” ",Exodus 3:8-4:5,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-3845-211974/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-08-30_exodus-3845_20110803042506.mp3
Exodus,"6 And Yahweh said to him again, “Put your hand into the fold of your garment.” And he put his hand into the fold of his garment, and he took it out, and, to his surprise, his hand was afflicted with a skin disease, like snow. 7 And he said, “Return your hand to the fold of your garment.” And he returned his hand to the fold of his garment, and he took it out from the fold of his garment, and, to his surprise, it was restored like the rest of his body. 8 “And if they do not believe you and they will not listen to the voice of the former sign, then they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 9 And if they also do not believe the second of these signs and they will not listen to your voice, then you must take water from the Nile and pour it onto the dry ground, and the water that you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.” 10 And Moses said to Yahweh, “Please, Lord, I am not a man of words, neither recently nor in the past nor since your speaking to your servant, because I am heavy of mouth and of tongue.” 11 And Yahweh said to him, “Who gave a mouth to humankind, or who makes mute or deaf or sighted or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh? 12 So then go, and I myself will be with your mouth, and I will teach you what you must speak.” 13 And he said, “Please, Lord, do send anyone else whom you wish to send.” 14 And Yahweh was angry with Moses and said, “Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite? I know that he certainly can speak, and also there he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will rejoice in his heart. 15 And you will speak to him, and you will put words in his mouth, and I myself will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you must do. 16 And he will speak for you to the people, and then he will be to you as a mouth, and you will be to him as a god. 17 And you must take this staff in your hand, with which you will do the signs.” 18 And Moses went, and he returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and he said to him, “Please let me go, and let me return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and let me see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” 19 And Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return to Egypt because all the men have died who were seeking your life.” 20 And Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on the donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt, and Moses took the staff of God in his hand. 21 And Yahweh said to Moses, “When you go to return to Egypt, see all of the wonders that I have put in your hand, and do them before Pharaoh, and I myself will harden his heart, and he will not release the people. 22 And you must say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Israel is my son, my firstborn.” 23 And I said to you, “Release my son and let him serve me,” but you refused to release him. Look, I am about to kill your son, your firstborn.’ ” 24 And on the way, at the place of overnight lodging, Yahweh encountered him and sought to kill him. 25 But Zipporah took a flint knife, and she cut off the foreskin of her son, and she touched his feet, and she said, “Yes, you are a bridegroom of blood to me.” 26 And he left him alone. At that time she said, “A bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision. 27 And Yahweh said to Aaron, “Go to the desert to meet Moses.” And he went and encountered him at the mountain of God and kissed him. 28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh, who had sent him—and all the signs that he had commanded him. 29 And Moses and Aaron went, and they gathered all of the elders of the Israelites. 30 And Aaron spoke all the words that Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and he did the signs before the eyes of the people. 31 And the people believed when they heard that Yahweh had attended to the Israelites and that he had seen their misery, and they knelt down and they worshiped. 1 And afterward, Moses and Aaron went, and they said to Pharaoh, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘Release my people so that they may hold a festival for me in the desert.’ ” 2 And Pharaoh said, “Who is Yahweh that I should listen to his voice to release Israel? I do not know Yahweh, and also I will not release Israel.” ",Exodus 4:6-5:2,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-4652-211975/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-08-31_exodus-4652_20110803042657.mp3

I do not know Yahweh, and also I will not release Israel.” 3 And they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go on a three-day journey into the desert, and let us sacrifice to Yahweh our God, lest he strike us with plague or with sword.” 4 And the king of Egypt said, “Why, Moses and Aaron, do you take the people from their work? Go to your forced labor!” 5 And Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now many, and you want to stop them from their forced labor.” 6 And on that day Pharaoh commanded the slave drivers over the people and his foremen, saying, 7 “You must no longer give straw to the people to make the bricks like before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. 8 But the quota of the bricks that they were making before you must require of them. You must not reduce from it, because they are lazy. Therefore they are crying out, saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ 9 Let the work be heavier on the men so that they will do it and not pay attention to words of deception.” 10 And the slave drivers of the people and their foremen went out, and they spoke to the people, saying, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I am not giving you straw. 11 You go, get straw for yourselves from whatever you find because not a thing is being reduced from your work.’ ” 12 And the people spread out in all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for the straw. 13 And the slave drivers were insisting, saying, “Finish your work for each day on its day, as when there was straw.” 14 And the foremen of the Israelites, whom Pharaoh’s slave drivers had appointed over them, were beaten by men who were saying, “Why have you not completed your portion of brickmaking as before, both yesterday and today?” 15 And the foremen of the Israelites came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you treat your servants like this? 16 Straw is not being given to your servants, but they are saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ and, look, your servants are being beaten, but it is the fault of your people.” 17 And he said, “You are lazy, lazy! Therefore you are saying, ‘Let us go; let us sacrifice to Yahweh.’ 18 And now go, work, but straw will not be given to you, and you must give the full quota of bricks.” 19 And the foremen of the Israelites saw they were in trouble with the saying, “You will not reduce from your bricks for each day on its day.” 20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting to meet them when they were going out from Pharaoh. 21 And they said to them, “May Yahweh look upon you and judge because you have caused our fragrance to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants so as to put a sword into their hand to kill us.” 22 And Moses returned to Yahweh and said, “Lord, why have you brought trouble to this people? Why ever did you send me? 23 And from the time I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble to this people, and you have certainly not delivered your people.” 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, because with a strong hand he will release them, and with a strong hand he will drive them out from his land.” 2 And God spoke to Moses, and he said to him, “I am Yahweh. 3 And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Shaddai, but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them. 4 And I not only established my covenant with them to give to them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, in which they dwelt as aliens, 5 but also I myself heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are making to work, and I remembered my covenant.

Exodus,"6 Therefore say to the Israelites, ‘I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the forced labor of Egypt, and I will deliver you from their slavery, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great punishments. 7 And I will take you as my people, and I will be your God, and you will know that I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from under the forced labor of Egypt. 8 And I will bring you to the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it to you as a possession. I am Yahweh.” 9 And Moses spoke thus to the Israelites, but they did not listen to Moses, because of discouragement and because of hard work. 10 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 11 “Go, speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and let him release the Israelites from his land.” 12 And Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, “Look, the Israelites do not listen to me, and how will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am a poor speaker?” 13 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and he commanded them to go to the Israelites and to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out from the land of Egypt. 14 These are the heads of their families. The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, are Enoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These are the clans of Reuben. 15 And the sons of Simeon are Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jakin and Zohar and Shaul the son of the Canaanitess. These are the clans of Simeon. 16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their genealogies: Gershon and Kohath and Merari, and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred and thirty-seven years. 17 The sons of Gershon are Libni and Shimei according to their clans. 18 And the sons of Kohath are Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel, and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred and thirty-three years. 19 And the sons of Merari are Mahli and Mushi. These are clans of the Levites according to their genealogies. 20 And Amram took Jochebed his aunt for himself as a wife, and she bore for him Aaron and Moses, and the years of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty-seven years. 21 And the sons of Izhar are Korah and Nepheg and Zikri. 22 And the sons of Uzziel are Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri. 23 And Aaron took Elisheba the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, for himself as a wife, and she bore for him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 24 And the sons of Korah are Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph.

These are the heads of the families of the Levites according to their clans. 26 It was that Aaron and Moses to whom Yahweh said, “Bring the Israelites out from the land of Egypt according to their divisions.” 27 They were those who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, in order to bring the Israelites out from Egypt. It was that Moses and Aaron. 28 And so it was on a certain day Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt. 29 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, “I am Yahweh. Speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, all that I am speaking to you.” 30 And Moses said before Yahweh, “Look, I am a poor speaker.

Exodus,"1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “See, I have made you as a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother will be your prophet. 2 You will speak all that I will command you, and Aaron your brother will speak to Pharaoh, and he will release the Israelites from his land. 3 And I myself will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and I will make my signs and my wonders numerous in the land of Egypt. 4 And Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will put my hand into Egypt and bring out my divisions, my people, the Israelites, from the land of Egypt with great punishments. 5 And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I stretch out my hand over Egypt and bring the Israelites out from their midst.” 6 And Moses and Aaron did it; as Yahweh commanded them, so they did. 7 (And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron was eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.) 8 And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 9 “When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, ‘Do a wonder for yourselves,’ you will say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it before Pharaoh, and it will become a snake.’ ” 10 And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Yahweh had commanded. And Aaron threw his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a snake. 11 And Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did likewise with their secret arts. 12 Each threw down his staff, and they became snakes, and Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs. 13 And Pharaoh’s heart was hard, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had said. 14 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is insensitive; he refuses to release the people. 15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Look, he is going out to the water, and you must wait to meet him on the bank of the Nile, and you must take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake. 16 And you must say to him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, “Release my people that they may serve me in the desert, and, look, you have not listened until now.” 17 Thus says Yahweh, “By this you will know that I am Yahweh. Look, I am about to strike with the staff that is in my hand the water that is in the Nile, and it will be changed to blood. 18 And the fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from the Nile.” ’ ” 19 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch your hand out over the waters of Egypt and over their rivers, over their canals, and over their pools and over all of their reservoirs of water, so that they become blood,’ and blood will be in all the land of Egypt and in vessels of wood and of stone.” 20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh had commanded, and he raised the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile before the eyes of Pharaoh and before the eyes of his servants, and all of the water that was in the Nile was changed to blood. 21 And the fish that were in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, and the Egyptians were not able to drink water from the Nile, and the blood was in all the land of Egypt. 22 And the magicians of Egypt did likewise with their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart was hard, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken. 23 And Pharaoh turned and went to his house, and this also he did not take to heart. 24 And all of the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, because they were unable to drink from the water of the Nile. 25 And seven days passed after Yahweh struck the Nile. 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Release my people so that they may serve me.” 2 And if you are refusing to release, look, I am going to plague all of your territory with frogs. 3 And the Nile will swarm with frogs, and they will go up and come into your house and into your bedroom and onto your bed and into the house of your servants and among your people and into your ovens and into your kneading troughs. 4 And the frogs will go up against you and against your people and against all of your servants.’ ” 5 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools, and bring up the frogs on the land of Egypt.’ ” ",Exodus 7:1-8:5,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-7185-211978/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-09-05_exodus-7185_20110803042904.mp3
Exodus,"6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs went up and covered the land of Egypt. 7 And the magicians did likewise with their secret arts, and they brought up frogs over the land of Egypt. 8 And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to Yahweh, and let him remove the frogs from me and from my people, and let me release the people so that they can sacrifice to Yahweh.” 9 And Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor over me. When shall I pray for you and for your servants and for your people to cut off the frogs from you and from your houses? They will be left only in the Nile.” 10 And he said, “Tomorrow.” And he said, “Let it be according to your word so that you will know that there is no one like Yahweh our God. 11 And the frogs will depart from you and from your house and from your servants. They will be left only in the Nile.” 12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried out to Yahweh over the matter of the frogs that he had brought on Pharaoh. 13 And Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died from the houses, from the courtyards, and from the fields. 14 And they piled them in countless heaps, and the land stank. 15 And Pharaoh saw that there was relief, and he made his heart insensitive, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken. 16 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the land, and it will become gnats in all the land of Egypt.’ ” 17 And he did so, and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and he struck the dust of the land, and it became gnats on the humans and on the animals; all of the dust of the land became gnats in all the land of Egypt. 18 And the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring out the gnats, but they were not able, and the gnats were on the humans and on the animals. 19 And the magicians said to Pharaoh, “It is the finger of God.” But the heart of Pharaoh was hard, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken. 20 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Start early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. Look, he is going out to the water, and you must say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Release my people so that they may serve me.” 21 But if you are not about to release my people, look, I am about to send out flies among you and among your servants and among your people and in your houses; and the houses of Egypt will fill up with the flies and also the ground that they are on. 22 But on that day I will distinguish the land of Goshen, where my people are staying, by there not being flies there, so that you will know that I am Yahweh in the midst of the land. 23 And I will put a distinction between my people and your people; this sign will be tomorrow.’ ” 24 And Yahweh did so, and a severe swarm of flies came to the house of Pharaoh and the house of his servants and in all the land of Egypt; the land was ruined because of the flies. 25 And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and he said, “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.” 26 And Moses said, “To do so is not right, because we will sacrifice to Yahweh our God a thing detestable to the Egyptians. Look, if we sacrifice before their eyes the thing detestable to the Egyptians, will they not stone us? 27 We will go a journey of three days into the desert, and we will sacrifice to Yahweh our God according to what he says to us.” 28 And Pharaoh said, “I myself will release you, and you will sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the desert. Only surely you must not go far. Pray for me.” 29 And Moses said, “Look, I am going out from you, and I will pray to Yahweh so that the flies depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh again deceive us by not releasing the people to sacrifice to Yahweh.” 30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to Yahweh. 31 And Yahweh did according to the word of Moses and removed the flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one was left. 32 And Pharaoh made his heart insensitive also this time, and he did not release the people. 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, “Release my people so that they may serve me.” 2 But if you are refusing to release and you still are keeping hold of them, 3 look, the hand of Yahweh is about to be present with a very severe plague on your livestock that are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the cattle, and on the sheep and goats. 4 But Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and not a thing will die from all that belongs to the Israelites.’ ” 5 And Yahweh set an appointed time, saying, “Tomorrow Yahweh will do this thing in the land.” 6 And Yahweh did this thing the next day; all the livestock of Egypt died, but from the livestock of the Israelites not one died. 7 And Pharaoh sent to check, and it turned out not even one from the livestock of Israel had died, but Pharaoh’s heart was insensitive, and he did not release the people.

Exodus,"8 And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, “Take for yourselves full handfuls of soot from a smelting furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heavens before the eyes of Pharaoh. 9 And it will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and it will become on humans and on animals a skin sore sprouting blisters in all the land of Egypt.” 10 And they took the soot of the smelting furnace, and they stood before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkled it toward the heavens, and it became skin sores sprouting blisters on humans and on animals. 11 And the magicians were not able to stand before Moses because of the skin sores, for the skin sores were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians. 12 And Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses. 13 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Start early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. Look, he is going out to the water, and you must say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, “Release my people so that they may serve me. 14 For at this time I am sending all of my plagues to you personally and among your servants and among your people so that you will know that there is no one like me in all the earth. 15 For now I could have stretched out my hand, and I could have struck you and your people with the plague, and you would have perished from the earth. 16 But for the sake of this I have caused you to stand—for the sake of showing you my strength and in order to proclaim my name in all the earth. 17 Still you are behaving haughtily to my people by not releasing them. 18 Look, about this time tomorrow, I am going to cause very severe hail to rain, the like of which has not been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. 19 And now send word; bring into safety your livestock and all that belongs to you in the field. The hail will come down on every human and animal that is found in the field and not gathered into the house, and they will die.” ’ ” 20 Anyone from the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of Yahweh caused his servants and livestock to flee to the houses. 21 But whoever did not give regard to the word of Yahweh abandoned his servants and his livestock in the field. 22 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand to the heavens, and let there be hail in all the land of Egypt, on human and on animal and on all the vegetation of the field in the land of Egypt.” 23 And Moses stretched out his staff to the heavens, and Yahweh gave thunder and hail, and fire went to the earth, and Yahweh caused hail to rain on the land of Egypt. 24 And there was hail, and fire was flashing back and forth in the midst of the very severe hail, the like of which was not in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation. 25 And the hail struck in all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, from human to animal, and the hail struck all the vegetation of the field and smashed every tree of the field. 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, there was no hail. 27 And Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them, “I have sinned this time. Yahweh is the righteous one, and I and my people are the wicked ones. 28 Pray to Yahweh. The thunder of God and hail are enough, and I will release you, and you will no longer have to stay.” 29 And Moses said to him, “At my leaving the city, I will spread out my hands to Yahweh. The thunder will stop, and the hail will be no more, so that you will know that the earth belongs to Yahweh. 30 But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the presence of Yahweh God.” 31 And the flax and the barley were struck, because the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud. 32 But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, because they are late-ripening. 33 And Moses went from Pharaoh out of the city, and he spread his hands to Yahweh, and the thunder and the hail stopped, and rain did not pour on the earth. 34 And Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder stopped, and he again sinned and made his heart insensitive, he and his servants. 35 And Pharaoh’s heart was hard, and he did not release the Israelites, as Yahweh had said by the agency of Moses. 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have made his heart insensitive and the heart of his servants in order to put these signs of mine in his midst, 2 so that you will tell in the ears of your child and your grandchild that I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and so that you will tell about my signs that I have done among them, and so you will know that I am Yahweh.” 3 And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and they said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, ‘Until when will you refuse to submit before me? Release my people so that they may serve me. 4 But if you are refusing to release my people, look, I am about to bring locusts into your territory tomorrow. 5 And they will cover the surface of the land, and no one will be able to see the land, and they will eat the remainder of what is left—what is left over for you from the hail—and they will eat every sprouting tree belonging to you from the field. 6 And your houses will be full, and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all Egypt, something that your fathers and your grandfathers never saw from the day they were on the earth until this day.’ ” And he turned and went out from Pharaoh. 7 And the servants of Pharaoh said to him, “Until when will this be a snare for us? Release the men so that they may serve Yahweh their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?” 8 And Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Serve Yahweh your God. Who are the ones going? 9 And Moses said, “With our young and with our old we will go; with our sons and with our daughters, with our sheep and goats and with our cattle we will go because it is the feast of Yahweh for us.” ",Exodus 9:8-10:9,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-98109-211980/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-09-07_exodus-98109_20110803043057.mp3
Exodus,"10 And he said to them, “Let Yahweh be thus with you as soon as I release you and your dependents. See that evil is before your faces. 11 No indeed; just the men go and serve Yahweh, since this is what you are seeking.” And he drove them out from the presence of Pharaoh. 12 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt with the locusts so that they may come up over the land of Egypt, and let them eat all the vegetation of the land, all that the hail left behind.” 13 And Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh drove an east wind into the land all that day and all night. The morning came, and the east wind had brought the locusts. 14 And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and they settled in all the territory of Egypt, very severe. Before it there were not locusts like them, nor will there be after it. 15 And they covered the surface of all the land, and the land was dark with them, and they ate all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left, and no green was left in the trees nor in the vegetation of the field in all the land of Egypt. 16 And Pharaoh hurried to call Moses and Aaron, and he said, “I have sinned against Yahweh your God and against you. 17 And now forgive my sin surely this time, and pray to Yahweh your God so that he may only remove from me this death.” 18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and he prayed to Yahweh. 19 And Yahweh turned a very strong west wind and lifted up the locusts and thrust them into the Red Sea, and not one locust remained in all the territory of Egypt. 20 And Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not release the Israelites. 21 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens so that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt and so that a person can feel darkness.” 22 And Moses stretched out his hand toward the heavens, and there was darkness of night in all the land of Egypt for three days. 23 No one could see his brother, and because of it no one could move from where they were for three days, but there was light for the Israelites in their dwellings. 24 And Pharaoh called Moses and said, “Go, serve Yahweh. Only your sheep and goats and your cattle must be left behind. Your dependents may also go with you.” 25 And Moses said, “Even if you yourself put into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings and we offer them to Yahweh our God, 26 our livestock must also go with us. Not a hoof can be left because we must take from them to serve Yahweh our God. And we will not know with what we are to serve Yahweh until we come there.” 27 And Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to release them. 28 And Pharaoh said to him, “Go from me. Be careful not to see my face again, because on the day of your seeing my face you will die.” 29 And Moses said, “That is right. I will not again see your face.” 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Still one plague I will bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt; afterward he will release you from here. At the moment of his releasing, he will certainly drive you completely out from here. 2 Speak in the ears of the people, and let them ask, a man from his neighbor and a woman from her neighbor, for objects of silver and objects of gold.” 3 And Yahweh gave the people favor in the eyes of Egypt. Also the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh and in the eyes of the people. 4 And Moses said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘About the middle of the night I will go out through the midst of Egypt, 5 and every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the slave woman who is behind the pair of millstones and every firstborn animal. 6 And there will be a great cry of distress in all the land of Egypt, the like of which has not been nor will be again. 7 But against all the Israelites, from a man to an animal, a dog will not even bark, so that you will know that Yahweh makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.’ 8 And all of these your servants will come down to me and bow to me, saying, ‘Go out, you and all the people who are at your feet.’ And afterward I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in great anger. 9 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that my wonders may multiply in the land of Egypt.” 10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not release the Israelites from his land.

Exodus,"1 And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, 2 “This month will be the beginning of months; it will be for you the first of the months of the year. 3 Speak to all the community of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth of this month, they will each take for themselves a lamb for the family, a lamb for the household. 4 And if the household is too small for a lamb, he and the neighbor nearest to his house will take one according to the number of persons; you will count out portions of the lamb according to how much each one can eat. 5 The lamb for you must be a male, without defect, in its first year; you will take it from the sheep or from the goats. 6 “You will keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, and all the assembly of the community of Israel will slaughter it at twilight. 7 And they will take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel on the houses in which they eat it. 8 And they will eat the meat on this night; they will eat it fire-roasted and with unleavened bread on bitter herbs. 9 You must not eat any of it raw or boiled, boiled in the water, but rather roasted with fire, its head with its legs and with its inner parts. 10 And you must not leave any of it until morning; anything left from it until morning you must burn in the fire. 11 And this is how you will eat it—with your waists fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand, and you will eat it in haste. It is Yahweh’s Passover. 12 “And I will go through the land of Egypt during this night, and I will strike all of the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from human to animal, and I will do punishments among all of the gods of Egypt. I am Yahweh. 13 And the blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and I will see the blood, and I will pass over you, and there will not be a destructive plague among you when I strike the land of Egypt.

Exodus,"13 And the blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and I will see the blood, and I will pass over you, and there will not be a destructive plague among you when I strike the land of Egypt. 14 “And this day will become a memorial for you, and you will celebrate it as a religious feast for Yahweh throughout your generations; you will celebrate it as a lasting statute. 15 You will eat unleavened bread for seven days. Surely on the first day you shall remove yeast from your houses, because anyone who eats food with yeast from the first day until the seventh day—that person will be cut off from Israel. 16 It will be for you on the first day a holy assembly and on the seventh day a holy assembly; no work will be done on them; only what is eaten by every person, it alone will be prepared for you. 17 “And you will keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because on this very day I brought out your divisions from the land of Egypt, and you will keep this day for your generations as a lasting statute. 18 On the first day, on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, you will eat unleavened bread until the evening of the twenty-first day of the month. 19 For seven days yeast must not be found in your houses, because anyone eating food with yeast will be cut off from the community of Israel—whether an alien or a native of the land. 20 You will eat no food with yeast; in all of your dwellings you will eat unleavened bread.” 21 And Moses called all the elders of Israel, and he said to them, “Select and take for yourselves sheep for your clans and slaughter the Passover sacrifice. 22 And take a bunch of hyssop and dip it into the blood that is in the basin and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts. And you will not go out, anyone from the doorway of his house, until morning. 23 And Yahweh will go through to strike Egypt, and he will see the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, and Yahweh will pass over the doorway and will not allow the destroyer to come to your houses to strike you. 24 “And you will keep this event as a rule for you and for your children forever. 25 And when you come into the land that Yahweh will give to you, as he said, you will keep this religious custom. 26 And when your children say to you, ‘What is this religious custom for you?’ 27 you will say, ‘It is a Passover sacrifice for Yahweh, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when he struck Egypt; and he delivered our houses.’ ” And the people knelt down and they worshiped. 28 And the Israelites went, and they did as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron; so they did. 29 And in the middle of the night, Yahweh struck all of the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the prison house and every firstborn of an animal. 30 And Pharaoh got up at night, he and all his servants and all Egypt, and a great cry of distress was in Egypt because there was not a house where there was no one dead. 31 And he called Moses and Aaron at night, and he said, “Get up, go out from the midst of my people, both you as well as the Israelites, and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said. 32 Take both your sheep and goats as well as your cattle, and go, and bless also me.” 33 And the Egyptians urged the people in order to hurry their release from the land, because they said, “All of us will die!” 34 And the people lifted up their dough before it had yeast; their kneading troughs were wrapped up in their cloaks on their shoulder. 35 And the Israelites did according to the word of Moses, and they asked from the Egyptians for objects of silver and objects of gold and for clothing. 36 And Yahweh gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they granted their requests, and they plundered the Egyptians. 37 And the Israelites set out from Rameses to Succoth; the men were about six hundred thousand on foot, besides dependents. 38 And also a mixed multitude went up with them and sheep and goats and cattle, very numerous livestock. 39 And they baked the dough that they had brought out from Egypt as cakes, unleavened bread, because it had no yeast when they were driven out from Egypt, and they were not able to delay, and also they had not made provisions for themselves. 40 And the period of dwelling of the Israelites that they dwelled in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. 41 And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, on this exact day, all of Yahweh’s divisions went out from the land of Egypt. 42 It is a night of vigils belonging to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt; it is this night belonging to Yahweh with vigils for all of the Israelites throughout their generations. 43 And Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover: No foreigner may eat it. 44 But any slave of a man, an acquisition by money, and you have circumcised him, then he may eat it. 45 A temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat it. 46 It will be eaten in one house; you will not bring part of the meat out from the house to the outside; and you will not break a bone of it. 47 All of the community of Israel will prepare it. 48 And when an alien dwells with you and he wants to prepare the Passover for Yahweh, every male belonging to him must be circumcised, and then he may come near to prepare it, and he will be as the native of the land, but any uncircumcised man may not eat it. 49 One law will be for the native and for the alien who is dwelling in your midst.” 50 And all the Israelites did as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron; so they did. 51 And it was on exactly this day Yahweh brought the Israelites out from the land of Egypt by their divisions.

Exodus,"1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Consecrate to me every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb among the Israelites, among humans and among domestic animals; it belongs to me.” 3 And Moses said to the people, “Remember this day when you went out from Egypt, from a house of slaves, because with strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from here, and food with yeast will not be eaten. 4 Today you are going out in the month of Abib. 5 And when Yahweh brings you to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites—which he swore to your ancestors to give to you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you will perform this service in this month. 6 Seven days you will eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day will be a feast for Yahweh. 7 Unleavened bread will be eaten the seven days; food with yeast will not be seen for you; and yeast will not be seen for you in all your territory. 8 And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, ‘This is because of what Yahweh did for me when I came out from Egypt.’ 9 And it will be as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes so that the law of Yahweh will be in your mouth, that with a strong hand Yahweh brought you out from Egypt. 10 And you will keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year. 11 “And when Yahweh brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your ancestors, and he gives it to you, 12 you will hand over every first offspring of a womb to Yahweh, and every first offspring dropped by a domestic animal that will belong to you, the males will be for Yahweh. 13 And every first offspring of a donkey you will redeem with small livestock, and if you will not redeem it, then you will break its neck, and every firstborn human among your sons you will redeem. 14 And when your son asks you in the future, saying, ‘What is this?’ you will say to him, ‘With strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from a house of slaves. 15 And when Pharaoh was stubborn to release us, Yahweh killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from firstborn human to firstborn domestic animal. Therefore I am sacrificing to Yahweh every first offspring of a womb, the males, and every firstborn of my sons I redeem.’ 16 And it will be as a sign on your hand and as symbolic ornaments between your eyes that with strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt.” 17 And when Pharaoh released the people, God did not lead them the way of the land of the Philistines, though it was nearer, because God said, “Lest the people change their mind when they see war and return to Egypt.” 18 So God led the people around by the way of the desert to the Red Sea, and the Israelites went up in battle array from the land of Egypt. 19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites solemnly swear an oath, saying, “God will surely attend to you, and you will take up my bones from here with you.” 20 And they set out from Succoth, and they encamped at Etham on the edge of the desert. 21 And Yahweh was going before them by day in a column of cloud to lead them on the way and by night in a column of fire to give light to them to go by day and night. 22 The column of cloud by day and the column of fire by night did not depart from before the people. 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Speak to the Israelites so that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; before Baal Zephon, which is opposite it, you will camp by the sea. 3 And Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, ‘They are wandering around in the land. The desert has closed in on them.’ 4 And I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and he will chase after them, and I will be glorified through Pharaoh and through all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh.” And they did so. 5 And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people fled, and the heart of Pharaoh was changed and that of his servants toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have released Israel from serving us!” 6 And he harnessed his chariot and took with him his people. 7 And he took six hundred select chariots and all the chariots of Egypt and officers over all of them. 8 And Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and he chased after the Israelites. (Now the Israelites were going out boldly.) 9 And the Egyptians chased after them, and they overtook them encamped at the sea—all the horses of the chariots of Pharaoh and his charioteers and his army—at Pi-hahiroth before Baal Zephon. 10 And Pharaoh approached, and the Israelites lifted their eyes, and there were the Egyptians traveling after them! And they were very afraid, and the Israelites cried out to Yahweh.

Exodus,"10 And Pharaoh approached, and the Israelites lifted their eyes, and there were the Egyptians traveling after them! And they were very afraid, and the Israelites cried out to Yahweh. 11 And they said to Moses, “Because there are no graves in Egypt? Is that why you have taken us to die in the desert? What is this you have done to us by bringing us out from Egypt! 12 Isn’t this the word we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone so that we can serve Egypt!’ because serving Egypt is better for us than our dying in the desert.” 13 And Moses said to the people, “You must not be afraid. Stand still and see the salvation of Yahweh, which he will accomplish for you today, because the Egyptians whom you see today you will see never again. 14 Yahweh will fight for you, and you must be quiet.” 15 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Why do you cry out to me? Speak to the Israelites so that they set out. 16 And you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it so that the Israelites can go in the middle of the sea on the dry land. 17 And as for me, look, I am about to harden the heart of the Egyptians so that they come after them, and I will display my glory through Pharaoh and through all of his army, through his chariots and through his charioteers. 18 And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I display my glory through Pharaoh, through his chariots, and through his charioteers.” 19 And the angel of God who was going before the camp of Israel set out and went behind them. And the column of cloud set out ahead of them, and it stood still behind them, 20 so that it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And it was a dark cloud, but it gave light to the night, so that neither approached the other all night. 21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh moved the sea with a strong east wind all night, and he made the sea become dry ground, and the waters were divided. 22 And the Israelites entered the middle of the sea on the dry land. The waters were a wall for them on their right and on their left. 23 And the Egyptians gave chase and entered after them—all the horses of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his charioteers—into the middle of the sea. 24 And during the morning watch, Yahweh looked down to the Egyptian camp from in the column of fire and cloud, and he threw the Egyptian camp into a panic. 25 And he removed the wheels of their chariots so that they drove them with difficulty, and the Egyptians said, “We must flee away from Israel because Yahweh is fighting for them against Egypt.” 26 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, and let the waters return over the Egyptians, over their chariots, and over their charioteers.” 27 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned at daybreak to its normal level, and the Egyptians were fleeing because of it, and Yahweh swept the Egyptians into the middle of the sea. 28 And the waters returned and covered the chariots and the charioteers—all the army of Pharaoh coming after them into the sea. Not even one survived among them. 29 But the Israelites walked on the dry land in the middle of the sea. The waters were a wall for them on their right and on their left. 30 And Yahweh saved Israel on that day from the hand of Egypt, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore of the sea. 31 And Israel saw the great hand that Yahweh displayed against Egypt, and the people feared Yahweh, and they believed in Yahweh and in Moses his servant.

Exodus,"1 Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to Yahweh, and they said, “Let me sing to Yahweh because he is highly exalted; the horse and its rider he hurled into the sea. 2 Yah is my strength and song, and he has become my salvation; this is my God, and I will praise him—the God of my father—and I will exalt him. 3 Yahweh is a man of war; Yahweh is his name. 4 The chariots of Pharaoh and his army he cast into the sea, and his choice adjutants were sunk in the Red Sea. 5 The deep waters covered them; they went down into the depths like a stone. 6 Yahweh, your right hand is glorious in power; Yahweh, your right hand destroyed the enemy. 7 And in the greatness of your majesty you overthrew those standing up to you; you released your fierce anger, and it consumed them like stubble. 8 And by the breath of your nostrils waters were piled up; waves stood like a heap; deep waters in the middle of the sea congealed. 9 The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide plunder, my desire will be full of them, I will draw my sword, my hand will destroy them.’ 10 You blew with your breath; the sea covered them; they dropped like lead in the mighty waters. 11 Who is like you among the gods, Yahweh? Who is like you—glorious in holiness, awesome in praiseworthy actions, doing wonders? 12 You stretched out your right hand; the earth swallowed them. 13 In your loyal love you led the people whom you redeemed; in your strength you guided them to the abode of your holiness. 14 Peoples heard; they trembled; anguish seized the inhabitants of Philistia. 15 Then the chiefs of Edom were horrified; great distress seized the leaders of Moab; all of the inhabitants of Canaan melted away. 16 Terror and dread fell on them; at the greatness of your arm they became silent like the stone, until your people passed by, Yahweh, until the people whom you bought passed by. 17 You brought them and planted them on the mountain of your inheritance, a place you made for yourself to inhabit, Yahweh, a sanctuary, Lord, that your hands established. 18 Yahweh will reign as king forever and ever.” 19 When the horses of Pharaoh came into the sea with his chariots and with his charioteers, Yahweh brought back upon them the waters of the sea, and the Israelites traveled on dry ground through the middle of the sea. 20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took her tambourine in her hand, and all of the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances. 21 And Miriam answered, “Sing to Yahweh because he is highly exalted; the horse and its rider he hurled into the sea.” 22 And Moses caused Israel to set out from the Red Sea, and they went out into the desert of Shur, and they traveled three days in the desert, and they did not find water. 23 And they came to Marah, and they were not able to drink water from Marah because it was bitter. Therefore it was named Marah. 24 And the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?” 25 And he cried out to Yahweh, and Yahweh showed him a piece of wood, and he threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There he made a rule and regulation for them, and there he tested them. 26 And he said, “If you carefully listen to the voice of Yahweh your God and you do what is right in his eyes and give heed to his commands and you keep all his rules, then I will not bring about on you any of the diseases that I brought about on Egypt, because I am Yahweh your healer. 27 And they came to Elim, and twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees were there, and they encamped there at the water.

Exodus,"1 And they set out from Elim, and all the community of the Israelites came to the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, in the fifteenth day of the second month of their going out from the land of Egypt. 2 And all the community of the Israelites grumbled against Moses and against Aaron in the desert. 3 And the Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread until we were full, because you have brought us out to this desert to kill all of this assembly with hunger.” 4 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Look, I am going to rain down for you bread from the heavens, and the people will go out and gather enough for the day on its day; in that way I will test them: Will they go according to my law or not? 5 And then on the sixth day, they will prepare what they bring, and it will be twice over what they will gather every other day.” 6 And Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening, you will know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt, 7 and in the morning, you will see the glory of Yahweh, for he hears your grumblings against Yahweh, and what are we that you grumble against us?” 8 And Moses said, “When in the evening Yahweh gives you meat to eat and bread in the morning to fill up on, for he hears your grumblings that you grumble against him—and what are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against Yahweh.” 9 And Moses said to Aaron, “Say to all the community of the Israelites, ‘Come near before Yahweh because he has heard your grumblings.’ ” 10 And at the moment of Aaron’s speaking to all the community of the Israelites, they turned to the desert, and just then the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud. 11 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 12 “I have heard the grumblings of the Israelites. Speak to them, saying, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be full with bread, and you will know that I am Yahweh your God.’ ” 13 And so it was, in the evening, the quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning, a layer of dew was all around the camp. 14 And the layer of dew came up, and there on the face of the desert was a fine granular substance, fine like frost on the ground. 15 And the Israelites saw, and they said to each other, “What is this?” because they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “That is the bread that Yahweh has given to you as food. 16 This is the word that Yahweh commanded, ‘Gather from it, each according to what he can eat, an omer per person according to the number of you. You each shall take enough for whoever is in his tent.’ ” 17 And the Israelites did so, and they gathered, some more and some less. 18 And when they measured with the omer, the one gathering more had no surplus, and the one gathering less had no lack; they gathered each according to what he could eat. 19 And Moses said to them, “Let no one leave any of it until morning.” 20 But they did not listen to Moses. Some people left some of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them. 21 And they gathered it morning by morning, each according to what he could eat, and it melted when the sun was hot. 22 And when it was the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one person, and all the leaders of the community came and told Moses. 23 And he said to them, “This is what Yahweh has said. Tomorrow is a rest period, a holy Sabbath for Yahweh. Bake what you want to bake, and boil what you want to boil. Put aside all the surplus for yourselves for safekeeping until the morning.” 24 And they put it aside until the morning, as Moses had commanded, and it did not make a stench, and not a maggot was in it. 25 And Moses said, “Eat it today, because today is a Sabbath for Yahweh. Today you will not find it in the field. 26 Six days you will gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, it will not be present on it.” 27 And on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they did not find any. 28 And Yahweh said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to keep my commands and my laws? 29 See, because Yahweh has given to you the Sabbath, therefore he is giving to you on the sixth day bread for two days. Stay, each in his location; let no one go from his place on the seventh day.” 30 And the people rested on the seventh day. 31 And the house of Israel called its name “manna.” And it was like coriander seed, white, and its taste was like a wafer with honey. 32 And Moses said, “This is the word that Yahweh has commanded. ‘A full omer of it is for safekeeping for your generations so that they will see the bread that I fed you in the desert when I brought you from the land of Egypt.’ ” 33 And Moses said to Aaron, “Take one jar and put there a full omer of manna. Leave it before Yahweh for safekeeping for your generations.” 34 As Yahweh had commanded Moses, so Aaron left it before the testimony for safekeeping. 35 And the Israelites ate the manna forty years, until their coming to an inhabited land; they ate the manna until their coming to the border of the land of Canaan. 36 (And an omer is a tenth of an ephah.)

Exodus,"1 And all the community of the Israelites set out from the desert of Sin for their journeys according to the command of Yahweh, and they camped in Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink. 2 And the people quarreled with Moses, and they said, “Give us water so that we can drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?” 3 And the people thirsted for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, “Why ever did you bring us up from Egypt to kill me and my sons and my cattle with thirst?” 4 And Moses cried out to Yahweh, saying, “What will I do with this people? A little longer and they will stone me.” 5 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go on before the people and take with you some from the elders of Israel, and the staff with which you struck the Nile take in your hand, and go. 6 Look, I will be standing before you there on the rock in Horeb, and you will strike the rock, and water will come out from it, and the people will drink.” And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel. 7 And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarrel of the Israelites and because of their testing Yahweh by saying, “Is Yahweh in our midst or not?” 8 And Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim. 9 And Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us, and go out, fight against Amalek tomorrow. I will be standing on the top of the hill, and the staff of God will be in my hand.” 10 And Joshua did as Moses had said to him to fight with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 11 And when Moses raised his hand, Israel would prevail, but when he rested his hand, Amalek would prevail. 12 But the hands of Moses were heavy, and they took a stone and placed it under him, and he sat on it; Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on each side, and his hands were steady until sundown. 13 And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 14 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Write this as a memorial in the scroll and recite it in the hearing of Joshua, because I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens.” 15 And Moses built an altar, and he called its name Yahweh Is My Banner. 16 And he said, “Because a hand was against the throne of Yah, a war will be for Yahweh with Amalek from generation to generation.” ",Exodus 17,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-17-218566/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-09-19_exodus-17_20110824215058.mp3
Exodus,"1 And Jethro, the priest of Midian, the father-in-law of Moses, heard all that God had done for Moses and for Israel, his people, that Yahweh had brought Israel out from Egypt. 2 And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, took Zipporah the wife of Moses after her sending away, 3 and her two sons—the one whose name was Gershom, for he had said, “I have been an alien in a foreign land,” 4 and the one whose name was Eliezer, for “the God of my father was my help, and he delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.” 5 And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, came and his sons and his wife to Moses, to the desert where he was camping there at the mountain of God. 6 And he said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you and your wife and her two sons with her.” 7 And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed, and he kissed him, and they each asked about the other’s welfare, and they came into the tent. 8 And Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to Egypt on account of Israel, all the hardship that had found them on the way, and how Yahweh delivered them. 9 And Jethro rejoiced over all the good that Yahweh had done for Israel when he delivered them from the hand of Egypt. 10 And Jethro said, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of Pharaoh—who has delivered the people from under the hand of Egypt. 11 Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all the gods, even in the matter where they the Egyptians dealt arrogantly against the Israelites.” 12 And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat bread with the father-in-law of Moses before God. 13 And the next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood before Moses from the morning until the evening. 14 And the father-in-law of Moses saw all that he was doing for the people, and he said, “What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why are you sitting alone and all the people are standing by you from morning until evening?” 15 And Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to seek God. 16 When they have an issue, it comes to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make known God’s rule and his instructions.” 17 And the father-in-law of Moses said to him, “The thing that you are doing is not good. 18 Surely you will wear out, both you and this people who are with you, because the thing is too difficult for you. You are not able to do it alone. 19 Now listen to my voice; I will advise you, and may God be with you. You be for the people before God, and you bring the issues to God. 20 And you warn them of the rules and the instructions, and you make known to them the way in which they must walk and the work that they must do. 21 And you will select from all the people men of ability, fearers of God, trustworthy men, haters of dishonest gain, and you will appoint such men over them as commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, and commanders of tens. 22 And let them judge the people all the time, and every major issue they will bring to you, and every minor issue they will judge themselves. And so lighten it for yourself, and they will bear it with you. 23 If you will do this thing and God will command you, then you will be able to endure, and also each of the people will go to his home in peace.” 24 And Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and he did all that he had said. 25 And Moses chose men of ability from all Israel, and he appointed them as heads over the people, as commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, and commanders of tens. 26 And they judged the people all the time; the difficult issues they would bring to Moses, and every minor issue they would judge themselves. 27 And Moses let his father-in-law go, and he went to his land. 1 In the third month after the Israelites went out from the land of Egypt, on this day they came to the Sinai desert. 2 They set out from Rephidim, and they came to the desert of Sinai, and they camped in the desert, and Israel camped there in front of the mountain. 3 And Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to him from the mountain, saying, “Thus you will say to the house of Jacob and you will tell the Israelites, 4 ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and I brought you to me. 5 And now if you will carefully listen to my voice and keep my covenant, you will be a treasured possession for me out of all the peoples, for all the earth is mine, ",Exodus 18:1-19:5,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-181195-218567/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-09-20_exodus-181195_20110824215105.mp3

They must wash their clothes, 11 and they must be prepared for the third day, because on the third day, Yahweh will go down on Mount Sinai before the eyes of all the people. 12 And you must set limits for the people all around, saying, ‘Guard yourselves against going up to the mountain and touching its edge. Anyone touching the mountain will certainly be put to death. 13 Not a hand will touch it, because he will certainly be stoned or certainly be shot; whether an animal or a man, he will not live.’ At the blowing of the ram’s horn they may go up to the mountain.” 14 And Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and he consecrated the people, and they washed their clothes. 15 And he said to the people, “Be ready for the third day. Do not go near to a woman.” 16 And on the third day, when it was morning, there was thunder and lightning, and a heavy cloud over the mountain and a very loud ram’s horn sound, and all the people who were in the camp trembled. 17 And Moses brought the people out from the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. 18 And Mount Sinai was all wrapped in smoke because Yahweh went down on it in the fire, and its smoke went up like the smoke of a smelting furnace, and the whole mountain trembled greatly. 19 And the sound of the ram’s horn became louder and louder, and Moses would speak, and God would answer him with a voice. 20 And Yahweh went down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, and Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. 21 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to see and many from them fall. 22 And even the priests who come near Yahweh must consecrate themselves, lest Yahweh break out against them.” 23 And Moses said to Yahweh, “The people are not able to go up to Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, saying, ‘Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.’ ” 24 And Yahweh said to him, “Go, go down, and come up, you and Aaron with you and the priests, but the people must not break through to go up to Yahweh, lest he break out against them.” 25 And Moses went down to the people, and he told them.

Exodus,"1 And God spoke all these words, saying, 2 “I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt, from the house of slaves. 3 “There shall be for you no other gods before me. 4 “You shall not make for yourself a divine image with any form that is in the heavens above or that is in the earth below or that is in the water below the earth. 5 You will not bow down to them, and you will not serve them, because I am Yahweh your God, a jealous God, punishing the guilt of the parents on the children on the third and on the fourth generations of those hating me, 6 and showing loyal love to thousands of generations of those loving me and of those keeping my commandments. 7 “You shall not misuse the name of Yahweh your God, because Yahweh will not leave unpunished anyone who misuses his name. 8 “Remember the day of the Sabbath, to consecrate it. 9 Six days you will work, and you will do all your work. 10 But the seventh day is a Sabbath for Yahweh your God; you will not do any work—you or your son or your daughter, your male slave or your female slave, or your animal, or your alien who is in your gates—11 because in six days Yahweh made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and on the seventh day he rested. Therefore Yahweh blessed the seventh day and consecrated it. 12 “Honor your father and your mother, so that your days can be long on the land that Yahweh your God is giving you. 13 “You shall not murder. 14 “You shall not commit adultery. 15 “You shall not steal. 16 “You shall not testify against your neighbor with a false witness. 17 “You shall not covet the house of your neighbor; you will not covet the wife of your neighbor or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that is your neighbor’s.” ",Exodus 20:1-17,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-201-17-218569/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-09-22_exodus-201-17_20110824215258.mp3
Exodus,"18 And all the people were seeing the thunder and the lightning and the sound of the ram’s horn and the mountain smoking, and the people saw, and they trembled, and they stood at a distance. 19 And they said to Moses, “You speak with us, and we will listen, but let not God speak with us, lest we die.” 20 And Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. God has come to test you so that his fear will be before you so that you do not sin.” 21 And the people stood at a distance, and Moses approached the very thick cloud where God was. 22 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Thus you will say to the Israelites, ‘You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from the heavens. 23 You will not make alongside me gods of silver, and gods of gold you will not make for yourselves. 24 An altar of earth you will make for me, and you will sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your fellowship offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I cause my name to be remembered, I will come to you, and I will bless you. 25 And if you make an altar of stones for me, you will not build them as hewn stone, because if you use your chisel on it, you have defiled it. 26 You will not go up with steps onto my altar, that your nakedness not be exposed on it.’ 1 “And these are the regulations that you will set before them. 2 ‘If you buy a Hebrew slave, he will serve six years, and in the seventh he will go out as free for nothing. 3 If he comes in single, he will go out single. If he is the husband of a wife, his wife will go out with him. 4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears for him sons or daughters, the wife and her children will belong to her master, and the slave will go out single. 5 But if the slave explicitly says, “I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,” 6 his master will present him to God and bring him to the door or to the doorpost, and his master will pierce his ear with an awl, and he will serve him forever. 7 “ ‘And if a man sells his daughter as a slave woman, she will not go out as male slaves go out. 8 If she does not please her master who selected her, he will allow her to be redeemed; he has no authority to sell her to foreign people, since he has dealt treacherously with her. 9 And if he selects her for his son, he shall do for her according to the regulations for daughters. 10 If he takes for himself another, he will not reduce her food, her clothing, or her right of cohabitation. 11 And if he does not do for her these three, she shall go out for nothing; there will not be silver paid for her. 12 “ ‘Whoever strikes someone and he dies will surely be put to death. 13 But if he did not lie in wait and it was an accident, I will appoint for you a place to which he may flee. 14 But if a man schemes against his neighbor to kill him by treachery, you will take him from my altar to die. 15 And whoever strikes his father or his mother will surely be put to death. 16 “ ‘And whoever kidnaps someone and sells him, or he is found in his possession, he will surely be put to death. 17 “ ‘And one who curses his father or his mother will surely be put to death. 18 “ ‘And if men quarrel and a man strikes his neighbor with a stone or with a fist and he does not die, but he is confined to bed, 19 if he stands and walks about in the outside on his staff, the striker will be unpunished; he will only pay for his inactivity toward his full recovery.” 20 And if a man strikes his male slave or his female slave with the rod and he dies under his hand, he will surely be avenged. 21 Yet if he survives a day or two days, he will not be avenged, because he is his money. 22 “ ‘And if men fight and they injure a pregnant woman, and her children go out and there is not serious injury, he will surely be fined as the woman’s husband demands concerning him and as the judges determine. 23 And if there is serious injury, you will give life in place of life, 24 eye in place of eye, tooth in place of tooth, hand in place of hand, foot in place of foot, 25 burn in place of burn, wound in place of wound, bruise in place of bruise. 26 “ ‘And if a man strikes the eye of his male slave or the eye of his female slave and destroys it, he shall release him as free in place of his eye. 27 And if he causes the tooth of his male slave or the tooth of his female slave to fall out, he will release him as free in place of his tooth. 28 “ ‘And if an ox gores a man or a woman and he dies, the ox will surely be stoned, and its meat will not be eaten, and the owner of the ox is innocent. 29 But if it was a goring ox before and its owner was warned and did not restrain it and it kills a man or a woman, the ox will be stoned, and the owner also will be put to death. 30 If a ransom is set on him, he will pay the redemption money for his life according to all that is set on him. 31 If it gores a son or it gores a daughter, according to this regulation it shall be done to him. 32 If the ox gores a male slave or a female slave, he will give thirty shekels of silver to his master, and the ox will be stoned. 33 “ ‘If a man opens a pit or if a man digs a pit and he does not cover it and an ox or a donkey falls into it, 34 the owner of the pit will pay restitution; he will pay silver to its owner, but the dead animal will be for him. 35 And if a man’s ox injures the ox of his neighbor and it dies, they will sell the living ox and divide the money, and they will also divide the dead one. 36 Or if it was known that it was a goring ox before and its owner did not restrain it, he will surely make restitution, an ox in place of the ox, and the dead one will be for him.

Do not lift your hand with the wicked to be a malicious witness. 2 You will not follow a majority for evil, and you will not testify concerning a legal dispute to turn aside after a majority to pervert justice. 3 You will not be partial to a powerless person in his legal dispute. 4 “ ‘If you come upon the ox of your enemy or his donkey going astray, you will certainly bring it back to him. 5 If you see the donkey of your enemy lying down under its burden, you will refrain from abandoning him.

And all the people answered with one voice, and they said, “All the words that Yahweh has spoken we will do.” 4 And Moses wrote all the words of Yahweh, and he rose early in the morning, and he built an altar at the base of the mountain and set up twelve memorial stones for the twelve tribes of Israel. 5 And he sent young men from the Israelites, and they offered burnt offerings, and they sacrificed sacrifices as fellowship offerings to Yahweh using bulls. 6 And Moses took half of the blood, and he put it in bowls, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 7 And he took the scroll of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people, and they said, “All that Yahweh has spoken we will do, and we will listen.” 8 And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and he said, “Look, the blood of the covenant that Yahweh has made with you in accordance with all these words.” 9 And Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy from the elders of Israel went up. 10 And they saw the God of Israel, and what was under his feet was like sapphire tile work and like the very heavens for clearness. 11 And toward the leaders of the Israelites he did not stretch out his hand, and they beheld God, and they ate, and they drank. 12 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain, and be there, and I will give you the tablets of stone and the law and the commandments that I have written to instruct them.” 13 And Moses got up, and Joshua, his assistant, and Moses went up to the mountain of God. 14 And to the elders he said, “Wait for us here until we return to you. And look, Aaron and Hur are with you. Whoever has a dispute will bring it to you.” 15 And Moses went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. 16 And the glory of Yahweh settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days, and he called to Moses on the seventh day from the midst of the cloud. 17 And the appearance of the glory of Yahweh was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain to the eyes of the Israelites. 18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and he went up the mountain, and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights. 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Speak to the Israelites, and let them bring to me a contribution. You will receive my contribution from every man whose heart prompts him. 3 And this is the contribution that you will receive from them—gold and silver and bronze, 4 blue, purple, and crimson yarns, and fine linen and goat hair, 5 and red-dyed ram skins, and fine leather, and acacia wood, 6 oil for the lamp, balsam oils for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, 7 onyx stones and stones for mountings on the ephod and the breast piece. 8 And make a sanctuary for me, and I will dwell in the midst of them, 9 according to all that I show you—the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its equipment—and so you will do.

Exodus,"1 “And you will make an altar for burning incense; you will make it of acacia wood, 2 a cubit its length and a cubit its width—it will be square—and two cubits its height, its horns of one piece with it. 3 And you will overlay it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around and its horns, and you will make for it a gold molding all around. 4 And you will make two gold rings for it; under its molding on two opposite sides you will make them as holders for poles to carry it with them. 5 You will make the poles of acacia wood, and you will overlay them with gold. 6 And you will put it before the curtain that is upon the ark of the testimony, before the atonement cover, which is on the testimony, there where I will meet with you. 7 “And on it Aaron will turn fragrant incense into smoke; each morning when he tends the lamps, he will turn it into smoke. 8 And when Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he will turn it into smoke—incense of continuity—before Yahweh throughout your generations. 9 You will not offer on it strange incense or a burnt offering or a grain offering, and you will not pour a libation on it. 10 And Aaron will make atonement on its horns one time in the year from the blood of the sin offering of the atonement; one time in the year he will make atonement on it throughout your generations; it is a most holy thing for Yahweh.” 11 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 12 “When you take a census of the Israelites to count them, they will each give the ransom of his life for Yahweh when counting them, and a plague will not be among them when counting them. 13 This they will give, everyone who is counted, the half shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, which is twenty gerahs per shekel. The half shekel is a contribution for Yahweh. 14 Everyone who is counted from twenty years old and above will give the contribution of Yahweh. 15 The rich will not give more, and the poor will not give less than the half shekel to give the contribution of Yahweh to make atonement for their lives. 16 And you will take the atonement money from the Israelites and give it to the service of the tent of assembly, and it will be as a memorial for the Israelites before Yahweh to make atonement for your lives.” 17 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 18 “And you will make a basin of bronze and its bronze stand for washing, and you will put it between the tent of assembly and the altar, and you will put water there. 19 And Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and their feet with it. 20 When they come to the tent of assembly, they will wash with water so that they do not die, or when they approach the altar to serve by turning to smoke an offering made by fire to Yahweh. 21 And they will wash their hands and their feet so that they do not die, and it will be a lasting rule for them—to him and to his offspring throughout their generations. 22 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 23 “And take for yourself top quality balsam oils, five hundred shekels of flowing myrrh, half as much—two hundred and fifty shekels of fragrant cinnamon, and two hundred and fifty shekels of fragrant reed, 24 and five hundred shekels of cassia, according to the sanctuary shekel, and a hin of olive oil. 25 And you will make it into holy anointing oil, a spice blend of a fragrant ointment the work of a perfumer; it will be holy anointing oil. 26 And you will anoint with it the tent of assembly and the ark of the testimony, 27 and the table and all its equipment and the lampstand and its equipment and the incense altar, 28 and the altar of burnt offering and all its equipment and the basin and its stand. 29 And you will consecrate them, and they will be most holy things; anyone who touches them will be holy. 30 And you will anoint Aaron and his sons, and you will consecrate them to serve as priests for me. 31 “And you will speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘This will be my holy anointing oil throughout your generations. 32 It will not be poured on human flesh, and with its measurements you will not make any like it; it is holy; it will be holy to you. 33 Anyone who compounds perfume like it and who puts it on a stranger will be cut off from his people.’ ” 34 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Take for yourself fragrant perfumes—stacte resin and onycha and galbanum—fragrant perfumes and pure frankincense, an equal part of each, 35 and make it into a compound of incense, the work of a perfumer, salted, pure, holy. 36 And you will grind part of it to powder, and you will put part of it before the testimony in the tent of assembly where I will meet with you; it will be a most holy thing to you. 37 And the incense that you will make with its measurements you will not make for yourselves; it will be holy to you for Yahweh. 38 Anyone who makes any like it to smell it will be cut off from his people.” ",Exodus 30,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-30-218578/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-10-05_exodus-30_20110824215937.mp3
Exodus,"1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah. 3 And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom and with skill and with knowledge and with every kind of craftsmanship, 4 to devise designs, to work with gold and with silver and with bronze, 5 and in stonecutting for setting and in cutting wood, for doing every kind of craftsmanship. 6 And, look, I have given with him Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, and I have put skill in the heart of all the skilled of heart, and they will make all that I have commanded you— 7 the tent of assembly and the ark of the testimony and the atonement cover that is on it and all the equipment of the tent, 8 and the table and all its equipment, and the pure gold lampstand and all its equipment, and the incense altar, 9 and the altar of burnt offering and all its equipment, and the basin and its stand, 10 and the garments of woven material, and the garments of the sanctuary for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to serve as priests, 11 and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense for the sanctuary. According to all that I have commanded you, they will make it. 12 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 13 “And you, speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘Surely you must keep my Sabbaths, because it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, in order to know that I am Yahweh, who consecrates you. 14 And you must keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you; defilers of it will surely be put to death, because anyone who does work on it—that person will be cut off from among his people. 15 On six days work can be done, and on the seventh is a Sabbath of complete rest, a holy day for Yahweh; anyone doing work on the Sabbath day will surely be put to death. 16 The Israelites will pay attention to the Sabbath in order to fulfill the Sabbath throughout their generations as a lasting covenant. 17 It is a sign between me and the Israelites forever, because in six days Yahweh made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh he ceased and recovered.” 18 And when he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, he gave to Moses the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets, written with the finger of God. 1 And the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, and the people gathered opposite Aaron, and they said to him, “Come, make for us gods who will go before us, because this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.” 2 And Aaron said to them, “Take off the rings of gold that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring it to me.” 3 And all the people took off the rings of gold that were on their ears and brought it to Aaron. 4 And he took from their hand, and he shaped it with a tool, and he made it a cast-image bull calf, and they said, “These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.” 5 And Aaron saw, and he built an altar before it, and Aaron called, and he said, “A feast for Yahweh tomorrow.” 6 And they started early the next day, and they offered burnt offerings, and they presented fellowship offerings, and the people sat to eat and drink, and they rose up to revel. 7 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, go down because your people behave corruptly, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt. 8 They have turned aside quickly from the way that I commanded them; they have made for themselves a cast-image bull calf, and they bowed to it, and they sacrificed to it, and they said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.’ ” 9 And Yahweh said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and, indeed, they are a stiff-necked people. 10 And now leave me alone so that my anger may blaze against them, and let me destroy them, and I will make you into a great nation.” 11 And Moses implored Yahweh his God, and he said, “Why, Yahweh, should your anger blaze against your people whom you brought up from the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand? 12 Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent he brought them out to kill them in the mountains and wipe them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger and relent concerning the disaster for your people. 13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by yourself, and you told them, ‘I will multiply your offspring like the stars of the heavens, and all this land that I promised I will give to your offspring, and they will inherit it forever.’ ” 14 And Yahweh relented concerning the disaster that he had threatened to do to his people. 15 And Moses turned and went down from the mountain, and the two tablets of the testimony were in his hand, tablets written on their two sides; on the front and on the back they were written. 16 And the tablets, they were the work of God; and the writing, it was the writing of God engraved on the tablets. 17 And Joshua heard the sound of the people in their shouting, and he said to Moses, “A sound of war is in the camp.” 18 But he said, “There is not a sound of shouting of victory, and there is not a sound of shouting of defeat. I hear a sound of singing.” 19 And as he came near to the camp, he saw the bull calf and dancing, and Moses became angry, and he threw the tablets from his hand, and he broke them under the mountain. 20 And he took the bull calf that they had made, and he burned it with the fire, and he crushed it until it became fine, and he scattered it on the surface of the water, and he made the Israelites drink. 21 And Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you brought on them such a great sin?” 22 And Aaron said, “Let not my lord become angry. You yourself know the people, that they are intent on evil. 23 And they said to me, ‘Make for us gods who will go before us, because this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’ 24 And I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off.’ And they gave it to me, and I threw it in the fire, and out came this bull calf.” 25 And Moses saw the people, that they were running wild because Aaron had allowed them to run wild, for a laughingstock among their enemies.

Exodus,"26 And Moses stood at the entrance of the camp, and he said, “Whoever is for Yahweh, to me.” And all the sons of Levi were gathered to him. 27 And he said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Put each his sword on his side. Go back and forth from gate to gate in the camp, and kill, each his brother and each his friend and each his close relative.’ ” 28 And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and from the people on that day about three thousand persons fell. 29 And Moses said, “You are ordained today for Yahweh, because each has been against his son and against his brother and so bringing on you today a blessing.” 30 And the next day Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to Yahweh. Perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.” 31 And Moses returned to Yahweh, and he said, “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin and made for themselves gods of gold. 32 And now if you will forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me from your scroll that you have written.” 33 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot him from my scroll. 34 And now go, lead the people to where I spoke to you. Look, my angel will go before you, and on the day when I punish I will punish them for their sin.” 35 And Yahweh afflicted the people because they had made the bull calf that Aaron had made. 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land that I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ 2 And I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, and the Hittites and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, 3 Go to a land flowing with milk and honey, but I will not go up among you, because you are a stiff-necked people, lest I destroy you on the way.” 4 And the people heard this troubling word, and they mourned, and they each did not put their ornaments on themselves. 5 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people; if one moment I were to go up among you, I would destroy you. And now take down your ornaments from on you, and I will decide what I will do to you.” 6 And the Israelites stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb onward. 7 And Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp far from the camp, and he called it the tent of assembly, and all seeking Yahweh would go out to the tent of assembly, which was outside the camp. 8 And at the going out of Moses to the tent, all the people would rise and stand, each at the opening of his tent, and gaze after Moses until his entering the tent. 9 And at the entering of Moses into the tent the column of cloud would descend and stand at the opening of the tent, and he would speak with Moses. 10 And all the people would see the column of cloud standing at the opening of the tent, and all the people would rise and bow in worship, each at the opening of his tent. 11 And Yahweh would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his neighbor. And he would return to the camp, and his assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not leave the middle of the tent. 12 And Moses said to Yahweh, “See, you are saying to me, ‘Take this people up.’ But you have not let me know whom you will send with me, and you yourself have said, ‘I know you by name, and you also have found favor in my eyes.’ 13 And now if I have found favor in your eyes, make known to me, please, your way, and so I may know you so that I can find favor in your eyes. And see that this nation is your people.” 14 And he said, “My presence will go, and I will give you rest.” 15 And he said to him, “If your presence is not going, do not bring us up from here. 16 And by what will it be known then that I have found favor in your eyes, I and your people? Is it not by your going with us? And so we will be distinguished, I and your people, from all the people who are on the face of the ground.” 17 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Also I will do this thing that you have spoken, because you have found favor in my eyes and I have known you by name.” 18 And he said, “Please show me your glory.” 19 And he said, “I myself will cause all my goodness to pass over before you, and I will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you, and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will show compassion to whom I will show compassion.” 20 But he said, “You are not able to see my face, because a human will not see me and live.” 21 And Yahweh said, “There is a place with me, and you will stand on the rock. 22 And when my glory passes over, I will put you in the rock’s crevice, and I will cover you with my hand until I pass over. 23 And I will remove my hand, and you will see my back, but my face will not be visible.” ",Exodus 32:26-33:23,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-32263323-218580/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-10-07_exodus-32263323_20110824220058.mp3
Exodus,"1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Cut for yourself two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. 2 And be ready for the morning, and go up in the morning to Mount Sinai and present yourself to me there on the top of the mountain. 3 And no one will go up with you, and neither let anyone be seen on all the mountain, nor let the sheep and goats and the cattle graze opposite that mountain.” 4 And Moses cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and he started early in the morning, and he went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and he took in his hand the two stone tablets. 5 And Yahweh descended in the cloud, and he stood with him there, and he proclaimed the name of Yahweh. 6 And Yahweh passed over before him, and he proclaimed, “Yahweh, Yahweh, God, who is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding with loyal love and faithfulness, 7 keeping loyal love to the thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and he does not leave utterly unpunished, punishing the guilt of fathers on sons and on sons of sons on third and fourth generations.” 8 And Moses hurried and knelt down to the earth and worshiped. 9 And he said, “Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, Lord, let my Lord, please, go among us—indeed it is a stiff-necked people—and forgive our iniquity and our sin and take us as your possession.” 10 And he said, “Look, I am about to make a covenant. In front of all your people I will do wonders that have not been created on all the earth and among all the nations, and all the people among whom you are will see Yahweh’s work, because what I am about to do with you will be awesome. 11 “Keep for yourself what I myself have commanded you today. Look, I am about to drive from before you the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites. 12 Be careful for yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, lest it be a snare among you. 13 Rather, you will tear down their altars, and you will break their stone pillars, and you will cut off their Asherah poles. 14 For you will not bow in worship to another god, for ‘Yahweh Is Jealous’ is his name, he is a jealous God, 15 lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they prostitute themselves after their gods, and they sacrifice to their gods, and they invite you, and you eat their sacrifice, 16 and you take from their daughters for your sons, and their daughters prostitute themselves after their gods, and they cause your sons to prostitute themselves after their gods. 17 You will not make gods of cast metal for yourself. 18 “You will keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Seven days you will eat unleavened bread, which I commanded you, at the appointed time of the month of Abib, for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt. 19 Every first offspring of a womb is for me—all of your male livestock, the first offspring of cattle and small livestock. 20 But the first offspring of a donkey you will redeem with small livestock, and if you will not redeem it, you will break its neck. Every firstborn of your sons you will redeem, and you will not appear before me empty-handed. 21 Six days you will work, and on the seventh day you will rest; in the time of plowing and in the time of harvest you will rest. 22 And you yourself will observe the Feast of Weeks—the firstfruits of the wheat harvest—and the Feast of Harvest Gathering at the turn of the year. 23 Three times in the year all your males will appear before the Lord, Yahweh, the God of Israel, 24 because I will evict nations before you, and I will enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh your God three times in the year. 25 “You will not slaughter the blood of my sacrifice on food with yeast, and the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover will not stay overnight to the morning. 26 The beginning of the firstfruits of your land you will bring to the house of Yahweh your God. You will not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.” 27 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Write for yourself these words, because according to these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.” 28 And he was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights. He ate no food and drank no water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten words. 29 And when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony were in the hand of Moses at his coming down from the mountain; and Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because of his speaking with him. 30 And Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, and, to their amazement, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid of coming near to him. 31 And Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the community returned to him, and Moses spoke to them. 32 And afterward all the Israelites came near, and he commanded them all that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. 33 And Moses finished speaking with them, and he put a veil on his face. 34 And when Moses came before Yahweh to speak with him, he would remove the veil until he went out, and he would go out and would speak to the Israelites what he had been commanded. 35 And the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of the face of Moses shone, and Moses would put back the veil on his face until his coming to speak with him. 1 And Moses assembled all the community of the Israelites, and he said to them, “These are the words that Yahweh has commanded for us to do them. 2 On six days work can be done, and on the seventh there will be for you a holy day, a Sabbath of complete rest, for Yahweh; anyone doing work on it will be put to death. 3 You will not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on the day of the Sabbath.” 4 And Moses said to all the community of the Israelites, saying, “This is the word that Yahweh has commanded, saying, 5 ‘Take from among you a contribution for Yahweh, anyone willing of heart, let him bring Yahweh’s contribution—gold and silver and bronze, 6 and blue and purple and crimson yarns, and fine linen and goat hair, 7 and red-dyed ram skins, and fine leather, and acacia wood, 8 and oil for the lamp, balsam oils for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, 9 onyx stones and stones for mountings on the ephod and the breast piece. 10 “And let all the skilled of heart among you come and make all that Yahweh has commanded: 11 The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering; its clasps and its frames; its bars, its pillars, and its bases; 12 the ark and its poles; the atonement cover and the curtain of the screen; 13 the table and its poles and all its equipment; and the bread of the presence; 14 and lampstand of the light and its equipment and its lamps and the oil for the light; 15 and the altar of incense and its poles; and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense and the entrance curtain for the entrance of the tabernacle; 16 the altar of the burnt offering and the bronze grating that is for it, its poles and all its equipment; the basin and its stand; 17 the hangings of the courtyard, its pillars, and its bases, and the screen for the courtyard gate; 18 the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the courtyard and their cords; 19 the woven garments for serving in the sanctuary—the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to serve as priests.” 20 And all the community of the Israelites went out from before Moses. 21 And they came—every man whose heart lifted him and every man whose spirit impelled him—they brought Yahweh’s contribution for the work of the tent of assembly and for all its service and for the holy garments. 22 And they came, the men in addition to the women, all who were willing of heart; they brought brooches and jewelry rings and signet rings and ornaments—every variety of gold object—every man who waved a wave offering of gold for Yahweh, 23 and every man with whom was found blue and purple and crimson yarns and fine linen and goat hair and red-dyed ram skins and fine leather brought it. 24 All who were presenting a contribution of silver and bronze brought Yahweh’s contribution, and all with whom was found acacia wood for all the work of service brought it. 25 And every woman who was skilled of heart with her hands they spun, and they brought yarn—the blue and the purple, the crimson and the fine linen. 26 And all the women whose heart lifted them with skill spun the goat hair. 27 And the leaders brought the onyx stones and stones for mountings for the ephod and for the breast piece 28 and the balsam oils and the oil for light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense. 29 Every man and woman whose heart impelled them to bring for all the work to be done that Yahweh had commanded by the agency of Moses—the Israelites brought freely to Yahweh. 30 And Moses said to the Israelites, “See, Yahweh has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah. 31 And he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom and with skill and with knowledge and with every kind of craftsmanship, 32 and to devise designs, to work with the gold and with the silver and with the bronze, 33 and in stonecutting for setting and in cutting wood, for doing every kind of design craftsmanship. 34 And he has put it in his heart to teach—he and Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan. 35 He has filled them with skill of heart to do every work of a craftsman and a designer and an embroiderer with the blue and with the purple, with the crimson yarns and with the fine linen and a weaver; they are doers of every kind of craftsmanship and devisers of designs.

Exodus,"1 And Bezalel and Oholiab and everyone who is skilled of heart in whom Yahweh has put wisdom and skill to know and to do all the work for the service of the sanctuary—they will do it, according to all that Yahweh has commanded.” 2 And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and everyone skilled of heart, in whose heart Yahweh had put skill, all whose heart lifted him to come near to the work in order to do it. 3 And they took from Moses all the contributions that the Israelites had brought for the work of the service for the sanctuary in order to do it, and they still brought to him voluntary offerings every morning. 4 And all the skilled workers who were doing all the work for the sanctuary came, each from his work that they were doing. 5 And they said to Moses, saying, “The people are bringing more than enough for the service of the work that Yahweh has commanded to be done.” 6 And Moses commanded, and they proclaimed the message in the camp, saying, “Let no man or woman again make anything for the sanctuary contribution.” And so the people were restrained from bringing. 7 And the material was enough for doing all the work, and it was left over. 8 And all who were skilled of heart among the doers of the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue and purple and crimson yarns, with cherubim; he made them, the work of a skilled craftsman. 9 The length of the one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width was four cubits for the one curtain; one measurement was for all the curtains. 10 And he joined five of the curtains one to another, and five curtains he joined one to another. 11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain, at the end in the set; so he did on the edge of the end curtain in the second set. 12 He made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the end of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite one to another. 13 And he made fifty gold clasps and joined the curtains one to another with the clasps, so that the tabernacle was one. 14 And he made curtains of goat hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made them eleven curtains. 15 The length of the one curtain was thirty cubits, and the width was four cubits for the one curtain; one measure was for the eleven curtains. 16 And he joined five curtains together and six curtains together. 17 And he made fifty loops on the edge of the end curtain in the set, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain in the second set. 18 And he made fifty bronze clasps for joining the tent to become one. 19 And he made a covering for the tent of red-dyed ram skin and a covering of fine leather to go above. 20 And he made the frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood as uprights. 21 The length of the frame was ten cubits, and the width of the one frame was one and a half cubits. 22 He made two pegs for the one frame for joining one to another and likewise for all the frames of the tabernacle. 23 And he made the frames for the tabernacle with twenty frames for the south side. 24 And he made forty silver bases under the twenty frames, with two bases under the one frame for its two pegs and two bases under the next frame for its two pegs. 25 And for the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty frames 26 and their forty silver bases, with two bases under the one frame and two bases under the next frame. 27 And for the rear of the tabernacle on the west he made six frames. 28 And he made two frames for the tabernacle corners at the rear. 29 And they were double at the bottom, and they were completely together on its top to the one ring; he did likewise for the two of them, for the two corners. 30 And there were eight frames and their sixteen silver bases, two bases, two bases under the one frame. 31 And he made five bars of acacia wood for the frames on the one side of the tabernacle, 32 and five bars for the frames on the second side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames at the rear on the west. 33 And he made the middle bar to run in the midst of the frames from end to end. 34 And he overlaid the frames with gold, and he made their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and he overlaid the bars with gold. 35 And he made the curtain of blue and purple and crimson yarns and finely twisted linen, the work of a craftsman; he made it with cherubim. 36 And he made for it four acacia pillars, and he overlaid them with gold, with their gold hooks, and he cast for them four silver bases. 37 And he made for the entrance of the tent a screen of blue and purple and crimson yarns and finely twisted linen, the work of an embroiderer, 38 and the five pillars and their hooks, and he overlaid their tops and their connections with gold, and their five bases were bronze. 1 And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits its length and a cubit and a half its width and a cubit and a half its height. 2 And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and he made for it a gold molding all around. 3 And he cast for it four gold rings on its four feet; and two rings were on its one side, and two rings were on its second side. 4 And he made poles of acacia wood, and he overlaid them with gold. 5 And he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry the ark. 6 And he made an atonement cover of pure gold, two and a half cubits its length and a cubit and a half its width. 7 And he made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered work at the two ends of the atonement cover. 8 One cherub was at one end, and one cherub was at the other end of the atonement cover; he made the cherubim at its two ends. 9 And the cherubim were with outspread wings above, covering with their wings over the atonement cover and facing each other; the faces of the cherubim were toward the atonement cover. 10 And he made the table of acacia wood, two cubits its length and a cubit its width and a cubit and a half its height. 11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and he made for it a gold molding all around. 12 And he made for it a handbreadth rim all around, and he made a gold molding for its rim all around. 13 And he cast for it four gold rings, and he put the rings on the four corners where its four legs were. 14 The rings were near the rim as holders for the poles to carry the table. 15 And he made the poles of acacia wood, and he overlaid them with gold to carry the table. 16 And he made the vessels that were on the table—its plates and its ladles, and its bowls and its pitchers with which libations were poured—of pure gold. 17 And he made the lampstand of pure gold; he made the lampstand of hammered work—its base and its branch, its cups, its buds, and its blossoms were all part of it. 18 And six branches were going out from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from its one side and three branches of the lampstand from its second side. 19 Three almond-flower cups were on the one branch with a bud and a blossom, and three almond-flower cups were on the one branch with a bud and a blossom—likewise for the six branches going out from the lampstand. 20 And on the lampstand were four almond-flower cups, with its buds and its blossoms. 21 And a bud was under the two branches that came from it, and a bud under the two branches from it, and a bud under the two branches from it, likewise for the six branches coming out from the lampstand. 22 Their buds and their branches were from it, all of it one piece of pure gold, hammered work. 23 And he made its seven lamps and its snuffers and its fire pans of pure gold. 24 He made it from a talent of pure gold and all its pieces of equipment. 25 And he made the incense altar of acacia wood, a cubit its length and a cubit its width—a square—and two cubits its height; its horns were of one piece with it. 26 And he overlaid it with pure gold—its top and its sides all around and its horns—and he made for it a gold molding all around. 27 And he made for it two gold rings under its molding on two opposite sides as holders for poles to carry it with them. 28 And he made the poles of acacia wood, and he overlaid them with gold. 29 And he made the holy anointing oil and the pure fragrant incense—work of a perfumer.

Exodus,"1 And he made the burnt-offering altar of acacia wood; its length was five cubits, and its width was five cubits—it was square—and its height was three cubits. 2 And he made its horns on its four corners; its horns were of one piece with it; and he overlaid it with bronze. 3 And he made all the equipment of the altar—the pots and the shovels and the sprinkling bowls and the forks and the fire pans—all its equipment he made with bronze. 4 And he made for the altar a grating, a work of bronze network under its ledge, below, up to its middle. 5 And he cast four rings on the four ends of the bronze grating as holders for the poles. 6 And he made the poles of acacia wood, and he overlaid them with bronze. 7 And he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar to carry it with them. He made it hollow with boards. 8 And he made the basin of bronze and its stand of bronze from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the entrance of the tent of assembly. 9 And he made the courtyard; for the south side were the hangings of the court of finely twisted linen, one hundred cubits, 10 with their twenty pillars and their twenty bases of bronze and with the hooks of the pillars and their bands of silver. 11 And for the north side the hangings were one hundred cubits with their twenty pillars and their twenty bases of bronze and with the hooks of the pillars and their bands of silver. 12 And for the west side fifty cubits of hangings with their ten pillars and their ten bases and with the hooks of the pillars and their bands of silver. 13 And for the eastward side, toward sunrise, fifty cubits; 14 fifteen cubits of hangings were to the shoulder, with their three pillars and their three bases, 15 and for the second shoulder on each side of the gate of the courtyard were fifteen cubits of hangings, with their three pillars and their three bases. 16 All the hangings of the courtyard all around were finely twisted linen, 17 and the bases for the pillars were bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their bands were silver, and the overlay of their tops was silver, and all the pillars of the courtyard were banded with silver. 18 And the screen of the gate of the courtyard was the work of an embroiderer, with blue and purple and crimson yarns and finely twisted linen; it was twenty cubits long and five cubits high, like the hangings of the courtyard, 19 and with their four pillars and their four bases of bronze, with their silver hooks and with their tops and their bands of silver. 20 And all the pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard all around were bronze. 21 These are the records of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, which were recorded at the command of Moses, the work of the Levites, in the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 22 And Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, did all that Yahweh commanded Moses. 23 And with him was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan, a skilled craftsman and a designer and an embroiderer with the blue and with the purple and with the crimson yarns and with the linen. 24 And all the gold used for the work, in the work of the sanctuary, it was the gold of the wave offering—twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel. 25 And the silver recorded from the community was a hundred talents and a thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel. 26 It was a bekah for the individual, the half shekel according to the sanctuary shekel, for everyone who was counted, from twenty years old and above, for six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty. 27 And it was one hundred talents of the silver to cast the bases of the sanctuary and the bases of the curtain—one hundred bases for one hundred talents of silver, a talent for each base. 28 And from the thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and he overlaid their tops, and he made bands for them. 29 And the bronze of the wave offering was seventy talents and two thousand four hundred shekels. 30 And he made with it the bases of the entrance of the tent of assembly and the bronze altar and the bronze grating that belonged to it and all the equipment of the altar 31 and the bases of the courtyard all around and the bases of the gate of the courtyard and all the pegs of the tabernacle and all the pegs of the courtyard all around.

Exodus,"1 And from the blue and the purple and the crimson yarns they made woven garments for serving in the sanctuary, and they made the holy garments that were for Aaron, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 2 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple and crimson yarns, and finely twisted linen. 3 And he hammered out the leaves of gold, and he cut off cords to weave in the midst of the blue and in the midst of the purple and in the midst of the crimson and in the midst of the linen—the work of a skilled craftsman. 4 They made joined shoulder pieces for it; it was joined on its two edges. 5 And the waistband of his ephod, which was of one piece with it, was of like work, gold, blue, and purple and crimson yarns, and finely twisted linen, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 6 And they made onyx stones mounted in gold filigree settings, engraved with seal engravings according to the names of the Israelites. 7 And he set them on the ephod’s shoulder pieces as stones of remembrance for the Israelites, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 8 And he made the breast piece, the work of a skilled craftsman, like the work of the ephod, of gold, blue, and purple and crimson yarns, and finely twisted linen. 9 It was squared; they made the breast piece doubled; its length was a span, and its width was a span when doubled. 10 And they filled it with four rows of stone; a row of carnelian, topaz, and emerald was the first row; 11 and the second row was a malachite, a sapphire, and a moonstone; 12 and the third row was a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 13 and the fourth row was a turquoise, an onyx, and a jasper. They were set with gold filigree settings in their mountings. 14 And the stones were according to the names of the Israelites; they were twelve according to their names, with seal engravings, each according to its name for the twelve tribes. 15 And they made on the breast piece braided chains, a work of pure gold ornamental cord. 16 And they made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and they put the two rings on the two edges of the breast piece. 17 And they put the two gold ornamental cords on the two rings on the edges of the breast piece. 18 And they put the two ends of the two ornamental cords on the two filigree settings, and they put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it. 19 And they made two gold rings, and they placed them on the two edges of the breast piece, on its lip that is on the other side of the ephod, to the inside. 20 And they made two gold rings and put them on the ephod’s two shoulder pieces below, at its front near its seam above the waistband of the ephod. 21 And they tied the breast piece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord so that the breast piece would be on the waistband of the ephod and not come loose from the ephod, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 22 And he made the robe of the ephod, weaver’s work, totally of blue yarn. 23 And the opening of the robe in the middle of it was like the opening of a sturdy garment, with an edge for its opening all around so that it would not be torn. 24 And they made on the hem of the robe pomegranates of finely twisted blue and purple and crimson. 25 And they made pure gold bells and put the bells in the midst of the pomegranates on the hem of the robe all around in the midst of the pomegranates, 26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate on the hem of the robe all around for serving, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 27 And they made the tunics of fine linen, a weaver’s work, for Aaron and for his sons, 28 and the turban of fine linen and the headdresses of the headbands of fine linen and undergarments of the linen cloth, finely twisted, 29 and the sash of finely twisted linen and blue and purple and crimson yarns, the work of an embroiderer, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 30 And they made the rosette of the holy diadem of pure gold, and they wrote on it with the writing of seal engravings: “A holy object for Yahweh.” 31 And they put a blue cord on it to put it above on the turban, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 32 And all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of assembly was finished, and the Israelites had done according to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses; so they did. 33 And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its equipment, its hooks, its frames, its bars, and its pillars and its bases; 34 and the covering of the red-dyed ram skins and the covering of fine leather and the curtain of the screen; 35 the ark of the testimony and its poles and the atonement cover; 36 the table, all its equipment, and the bread of the presence; 37 the pure gold lampstand, its lamps—the lamps of the row—and all its equipment and the oil of the light; 38 the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the screen of the entrance of the tent; 39 the bronze altar, and the bronze grating that is for it, its poles, and all its equipment, the basin and its stand, 40 the hangings of the courtyard, its pillars, and its bases; and the screen for the courtyard gate, its tent cords and its pegs; and all the equipment of the service of the tabernacle for the tent of assembly, 41 the woven garments for serving in the sanctuary—the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests. 42 According to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses, so the Israelites did all the work. 43 And Moses saw all the work, and, indeed, they had done it as Yahweh had commanded; so they did, and Moses blessed them. 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “On the first day of the month, you will set up the tabernacle of the tent of assembly. 3 And you will put there the ark of the testimony, and you will cover over the ark with the curtain. 4 And you will bring the table, and you will arrange its setting, and you will bring the lampstand, and you will set up its lamps. 5 And you will put the gold altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and you will set up the entrance screen for the tabernacle. 6 And you will put the altar of the burnt offering before the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of assembly. 7 And you will put the basin between the tent of assembly and the altar, and you will put water in it. 8 And you will set up the courtyard all around, and you will put up the screen of the gate of the courtyard. 9 “And you will take the anointing oil, and you will anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and you will consecrate all of its equipment, and it will be holy. 10 And you will anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all of its equipment, and you will consecrate the altar, and the altar will be a most holy thing. 11 And you will anoint the basin and its stand, and you will consecrate it. 12 And you will bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of assembly, and you will wash them with the water. 13 And you will clothe Aaron with the holy garments, and you will anoint him, and you will consecrate him, and he will serve as a priest for me. 14 And you will bring his sons, and you will clothe them with tunics. 15 And you will anoint them as you anointed their father, and they will serve as priests for me. And their anointing will be for them to be a lasting priesthood throughout their generations.” 16 And Moses did according to all that Yahweh had commanded him; so he did. 17 In the first month of the second year, on the first of the month, the tabernacle was set up. 18 And Moses raised the tabernacle, and he placed its bases, and he set up its frames, and he placed its bars, and he raised its pillars. 19 And he spread the tent over the tabernacle; he placed the covering of the tent over it, above it, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 20 And he took and he put the testimony into the ark, and he placed the poles on the ark, and he put the atonement cover on the ark, above it. 21 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and he set up the curtain of the screening, and he shielded the ark of the testimony, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 22 And he put the table in the tent of assembly on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain. 23 And he arranged on it an arrangement of bread before Yahweh, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 24 And he placed the lampstand in the tent of assembly opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle. 25 And he set up the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 26 And he placed the gold altar in the tent of assembly before the curtain. 27 And he turned fragrant incense into smoke on it, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 28 And he set up the entrance screen for the tabernacle. 29 And the altar of burnt offering he placed at the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of assembly, and he offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 30 And he placed the basin between the tent of assembly and the altar, and he put there water for washing. 31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet from it. 32 At their going into the tent of assembly and at their approaching the altar, they washed, as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 33 And he set up the courtyard all around the tabernacle and the altar, and he put up the screen of the gate of the courtyard, and Moses completed the work. 34 And the cloud covered the tent of assembly, and the glory of Yahweh filled the tabernacle. 35 And Moses was unable to go into the tent of assembly because the cloud settled on it and the glory of Yahweh filled the tabernacle. 36 And when the cloud was lifted from the tabernacle, the Israelites set out on all their journeys. 37 But if the cloud was not lifted, they did not set out until the day of its being lifted. 38 For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night before the eyes of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.

Matthew,"16 and Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary by whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. 17 Therefore all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ are fourteen generations. 18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ occurred in this way. His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit. 19 So Joseph her husband, being righteous and not wanting to disgrace her, intended to divorce her secretly. 20 But as he was considering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21 And she will give birth to a son, and you will call his name ‘Jesus,’ because he will save his people from their sins.” 22 Now all this happened in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying, 23 “Behold, the virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and they will call his name Emmanuel,” which is translated, “God with us.” 24 And Joseph, when he woke up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and he took his wife 25 and did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.

Matthew,"1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, 2 saying, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star at its rising and have come to worship him.” 3 And when King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him, 4 and after calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them where the Christ was to be born. 5 So they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet, 6 ‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, for from you will go out a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’ ” 7 Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and determined precisely from them the time when the star appeared. 8 And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go, inquire carefully concerning the child, and when you have found him, report to me so that I also may come and worship him.” 9 After they listened to the king, they went out, and behold, the star which they had seen at its rising led them until it came and stood above the place where the child was. 10 Now when they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy. 11 And when they came into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. And opening their treasure boxes, they offered him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.

Matthew,"12 And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country by another route. 13 Now after they had gone away, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.” 14 So he got up and took the child and his mother during the night and went away to Egypt. 15 And he was there until the death of Herod, in order that what was said by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.” 16 Then Herod, when he saw that he had been deceived by the wise men, became very angry, and he sent soldiers and executed all the children in Bethlehem and in all the region around it from the age of two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined precisely from the wise men. 17 Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, saying, 18 “A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and she did not want to be comforted, because they exist no longer.” 19 Now after Herod had died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 20 saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the child are dead.” 21 So he got up and took the child and his mother and entered the land of Israel. 22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream, he took refuge in the regions of Galilee. 23 And he came and lived in a town called Nazareth, in order that what was said by the prophets would be fulfilled: “He will be called a Nazarene.” 1 Now in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the Judean wilderness 2 and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near!” 3 For this is the one who was spoken about by the prophet Isaiah, saying, “The voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.’ ” 4 Now John himself had his clothing made from camel’s hair and a belt made of leather around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. 5 Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan were going out to him, 6 and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins. 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8 Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance! 9 And do not think to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones!

Matthew,"10 Already now the ax is positioned at the root of the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 11 I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 12 His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clean out his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John in order to be baptized by him. 14 But John tried to prevent him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” 15 But Jesus answered and said to him, “Permit it now, for in this way it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he permitted him. 16 Now after he was baptized, Jesus immediately went up from the water, and behold, the heavens opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove coming upon him. 17 And behold, there was a voice from heaven saying, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” 1 Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil, 2 and after he had fasted forty days and forty nights, then he was hungry. 3 And the tempter approached and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, order that these stones become bread.” 4 But he answered and said, “It is written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.” 5 Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the highest point of the temple 6 and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down! For it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and ‘On their hands they will lift you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’ ” 7 Jesus said to him, “On the other hand it is written, ‘You are not to put the Lord your God to the test.’ ” 8 Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, 9 and he said to him, “I will give to you all these things, if you will fall down and worship me.” 10 Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan, for it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’ ” 11 Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and began ministering to him.

Matthew,"12 Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. 13 And leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, 14 in order that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, 15 “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, toward the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles— 16 the people who sit in darkness have seen a great light, and the ones who sit in the land and shadow of death, a light has dawned on them.” 17 From that time on, Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven is near.” 18 Now as he was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, throwing a casting net into the sea (for they were fishermen). 19 And he said to them, “Follow me and I will make you fishers of people.” 20 And immediately they left their nets and followed him. 21 And going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them. 22 And immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. 23 And he went around through all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. 24 And a report about him went out throughout Syria, and they brought to him all those who were sick with various diseases and afflicted by torments, demon-possessed and epileptics and paralytics, and he healed them. 25 And large crowds followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from the other side of the Jordan.

Matthew,"1 Now when he saw the crowds, he went up the mountain and after he sat down, his disciples approached him. 2 And opening his mouth he began to teach them, saying, 3 “Blessed are the poor in spirit, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 Blessed are the ones who mourn, because they will be comforted. 5 Blessed are the meek, because they will inherit the earth.

Matthew,"5 Blessed are the meek, because they will inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are the ones who hunger and thirst for righteousness, because they will be satisfied. 7 Blessed are the merciful, because they will be shown mercy. 8 Blessed are the pure in heart, because they will see God. 9 Blessed are the peacemakers, because they will be called sons of God. 10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you, lying on account of me. 12 Rejoice and be glad, because your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you. 13 “You are the salt of the earth. But if salt becomes tasteless, by what will it be made salty? It is good for nothing any longer except to be thrown outside and trampled under foot by people. 14 You are the light of the world. A city located on top of a hill cannot be hidden, 15 nor do they light a lamp and place it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines on all those in the house. 16 In the same way let your light shine before people, so that they can see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven. 17 “Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy them but to fulfill them. 18 For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one tiny letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all takes place. 19 Therefore whoever abolishes one of the least of these commandments and teaches people to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever keeps them and teaches them, this person will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say to you that unless your righteousness greatly surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven. 21 “You have heard that it was said to the people of old, ‘Do not commit murder,’ and ‘whoever commits murder will be subject to judgment.’ 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry at his brother will be subject to judgment, and whoever says to his brother, ‘Stupid fool!’ will be subject to the council, and whoever says, ‘Obstinate fool!’ will be subject to fiery hell. 23 Therefore if you present your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, 24 leave your gift there before the altar and first go be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your gift. 25 Settle the case quickly with your accuser while you are with him on the way, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I say to you, you will never come out of there until you have paid back the last penny! 27 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’ 28 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 And if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your members be destroyed than your whole body be thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your limbs be destroyed than your whole body go into hell. 31 “And it was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’ 32 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for a matter of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 33 “Again you have heard that it was said to the people of old, ‘Do not swear falsely, but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.’ 34 But I say to you, do not swear at all, either by heaven, because it is the throne of God, 35 or by the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet, or by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great king. 36 And do not swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black. 37 But let your statement be ‘Yes, yes; no, no,’ and anything beyond these is from the evil one. 38 “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ 39 But I say to you, do not resist the evildoer, but whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him also. 40 And the one who wants to go to court with you and take your tunic, let him have your outer garment also. 41 And whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two. 42 Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. 43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor’ and ‘Hate your enemy.’ 44 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 in order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven, because he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust. 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?

Matthew,"42 Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. 43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor’ and ‘Hate your enemy.’ 44 But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 in order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven, because he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust. 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?

Do not the Gentiles also do the same? 48 Therefore you be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect. 1 “And take care not to practice your righteousness before people to be seen by them; otherwise you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. 2 Therefore whenever you practice charitable giving, do not sound a trumpet in front of you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, in order that they may be praised by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full! 3 But you, when you practice charitable giving, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 in order that your charitable giving may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. 5 And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, in order that they may be seen by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full! 6 But whenever you pray, enter into your inner room and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. 7 “But when you pray, do not babble repetitiously like the pagans, for they think that because of their many words they will be heard. 8 Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. 9 Therefore you pray in this way: “Our Father who is in heaven, may your name be treated as holy. 10 May your kingdom come, may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. 11 Give us today our daily bread, 12 and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 13 And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. 14 For if you forgive people their sins, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive people, neither will your Father forgive your sins. 16 “Whenever you fast, do not be sullen like the hypocrites, for they make their faces unrecognizable in order that they may be seen fasting by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full! 17 But when you are fasting, put olive oil on your head and wash your face 18 so that you will not be seen by people as fasting, but to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. 19 “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and consuming insect destroy and where thieves break in and steal, 20 but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor consuming insect destroy and where thieves do not break in or steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 22 “The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore if your eye is sincere, your whole body will be full of light. 23 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. Therefore if the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! 24 “No one is able to serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You are not able to serve God and money. 25 “For this reason I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, what you will eat, and not for your body, what you will wear. Is your life not more than food and your body more than clothing? 26 Consider the birds of the sky, that they do not sow or reap or gather produce into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are? 27 And who among you, by being anxious, is able to add one hour to his life span? 28 And why are you anxious about clothing? Observe the lilies of the field, how they grow: they do not toil or spin, 29 but I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these. 30 But if God dresses the grass of the field in this way, although it is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not do so much more for you, you of little faith? 31 Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?,’ 32 for the pagans seek after all these things. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 33 But seek first his kingdom and righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. 34 Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, because tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

First remove the beam of wood from your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye! 6 “Do not give what is holy to dogs, or throw your pearls in front of pigs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn around and tear you to pieces. 7 “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened for you. 8 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. 9 Or what man is there among you, if his son will ask him for bread, will give him a stone? 10 Or also if he will ask for a fish, will give him a snake? 11 Therefore if you, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him? 12 Therefore in all things, whatever you want that people should do to you, thus also you do to them. For this is the law and the prophets. 13 “Enter through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it, 14 because narrow is the gate and constricted is the road that leads to life, and there are few who find it! 15 “Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inside are ravenous wolves. 16 You will recognize them by their fruits: they do not gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles, do they? 17 In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit. 18 A good tree is not able to produce bad fruit, nor a bad tree to produce good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 As a result, you will recognize them by their fruits. 21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many miracles in your name?’ 23 And then I will say to them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness!’ 24 “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it did not collapse, because its foundation was laid on the rock. 26 And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it collapsed, and its fall was great.” 28 And it happened when Jesus finished these words the crowds were amazed at his teaching, 29 because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like their scribes.

Matthew,"1 And when he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him. 2 And behold, a leper approached and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you are able to make me clean.” 3 And extending his hand he touched him, saying, “I am willing, be clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 4 And Jesus said to him, “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.” 5 Now when he entered Capernaum, a centurion approached him, appealing to him 6 and saying, “Lord, my slave is lying paralyzed in my house, terribly tormented!” 7 And he said to him, “I will come and heal him.” 8 And the centurion answered and said, “Lord, I am not worthy that you should come in under my roof. But only say the word and my slave will be healed. 9 For I also am a man under authority who has soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another one, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.” 10 Now when Jesus heard this, he was astonished, and said to those who were following him, “Truly I say to you, I have found such great faith with no one in Israel. 11 But I say to you that many will come from east and west and be seated at the banquet with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 12 But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!” 13 And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go, as you have believed it will be done for you.” And the slave was healed at that hour. 14 And when Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down and suffering with a fever. 15 And he touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him. 16 Now when it was evening, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed, and he expelled the spirits with a word. And he healed all those who were sick, 17 in order that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, “He himself took away our sicknesses, and carried away our diseases.” ",Matthew 8:1-17,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-81-17-198657/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-07-19_matthew-81-17_20110621121657.mp3
Matthew,"18 Now when Jesus saw many crowds around him, he gave orders to depart to the other side. 19 And a scribe approached and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go!” 20 And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.” 21 And another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.” 22 But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead!” 23 And as he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. 24 And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being inundated by the waves, but he himself was asleep. 25 And they came and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!” 26 And he said to them, “Why are you fearful, you of little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm. 27 And the men were astonished, saying, “What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?” 28 And when he came to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from among the tombs met him, very violent, so that no one was able to pass by along that road. 29 And behold, they cried out, saying, “What do you have to do with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?” 30 Now a long way from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. 31 So the demons implored him, saying, “If you are going to expel us, send us into the herd of pigs.” 32 And he said to them, “Go!” So they departed and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and drowned in the water. 33 Now the herdsmen fled and went into the town and reported everything, including the things concerning the demon-possessed men. 34 And behold, the whole town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they implored him that he would depart from their region. 1 And getting into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own town. 2 And behold, they brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher, and when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Have courage, child, your sins are forgiven.” 3 And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!” 4 And knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts? 5 For which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’? 6 But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” then he said to the paralytic, “Get up, pick up your stretcher and go to your home.” 7 And he got up and went to his home. 8 But when the crowds saw this, they were afraid and glorified God who had given such authority to men. 9 And as Jesus was going away from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth and said to him, “Follow me!” And he stood up and followed him. 10 And it happened as he was dining in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners were coming and dining with Jesus and his disciples. 11 And when they saw it, the Pharisees began to say to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 12 And when he heard it, he said, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those who are sick. 13 But go and learn what it means, “I want mercy and not sacrifice.” For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” 14 Then the disciples of John approached him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?” ",Matthew 8:18-9:14,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-818914-198658/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-07-20_matthew-818914_20110621121913.mp3
Matthew,"14 Then the disciples of John approached him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?” 15 And Jesus said to them, “The bridegroom’s attendants are not able to mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them. But days are coming when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. 16 But no one puts a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment, for its patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear becomes worse. 17 Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wineskins burst and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are destroyed. But they put new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved.” 18 As he was saying these things to them, behold, one of the rulers came and knelt down before him, saying, “My daughter has just now died, but come, place your hand on her and she will live!” 19 And Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him. 20 And behold, a woman who had been suffering with a hemorrhage twelve years approached from behind and touched the edge of his cloak, 21 for she said to herself, “If only I touch his cloak I will be healed.” 22 But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, “Have courage, daughter! Your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed from that hour. 23 And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the disorderly crowd, 24 he said, “Go away, because the girl is not dead, but is sleeping.” And they ridiculed him. 25 But when the crowd had been sent out, he entered and took her hand, and the girl got up. 26 And this report went out into that whole region. 27 And as Jesus was going away from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” 28 And when he came into the house, the blind men approached him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.” 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith let it be done for you.” 30 And their eyes were opened, and Jesus sternly warned them, saying, “See that no one finds out.” 31 But they went out and spread the report about him in that whole region. 32 Now as they were going away, behold, they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was unable to speak. 33 And after the demon had been expelled, the one who had been mute spoke, and the crowds were astonished, saying, “This has never been seen before in Israel!” 34 But the Pharisees were saying, “By the ruler of demons he expels the demons!” 35 And Jesus was going around all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness. 36 And when he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were weary and dejected, like sheep that did not have a shepherd. 37 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. 38 Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest that he send out workers into his harvest.” 1 And summoning his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could expel them and could heal every disease and every sickness. 2 Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, 3 Philip, and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, 4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot—the one who also betrayed him. 5 Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them saying, “Do not go on the road to the Gentiles, and do not enter into a city of the Samaritans, 6 but go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 7 And as you are going, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near!’ 8 Heal those who are sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, expel demons.

Matthew,"9 Do not procure gold or silver or copper for your belts. 10 Do not take a traveler’s bag for the road, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff, for the worker is deserving of his provisions. 11 And into whatever town or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you depart. 12 And when you enter into the house, greet it. 13 And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. 14 And whoever does not welcome you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you are going out of that house or that town. 15 Truly I say to you, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town! 16 “Behold, I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. 17 But beware of people, because they will hand you over to councils, and they will flog you in their synagogues. 18 And you will be brought before both governors and kings because of me, for a witness to them and to the Gentiles. 19 But whenever they hand you over, do not be anxious how to speak or what you should say, for what you should say will be given to you at that hour. 20 For you are not the ones who are speaking, but the Spirit of your Father who is speaking through you. 21 “And brother will hand over brother to death, and a father his children, and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death, 22 and you will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end—this one will be saved. 23 And whenever they persecute you in this town, flee to another, for truly I say to you, you will never finish going through the towns of Israel until the Son of Man comes. 24 “A disciple is not superior to his teacher, nor a slave superior to his master. 25 It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household? 26 “Therefore do not be afraid of them, because nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not become known. 27 What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light, and what you hear in your ear, proclaim on the housetops. 28 And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul, but instead be afraid of the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And one of them will not fall to the ground without the knowledge and consent of your Father. 30 And even the hairs of your head are all numbered! 31 Therefore do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. 32 “Therefore everyone who acknowledges me before people, I also will acknowledge him before my Father who is in heaven. 33 But whoever denies me before people, I also will deny him before my Father who is in heaven. 34 “Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth! I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. 35 For I have come to turn a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. 36 And the enemies of a man will be the members of his household. 37 The one who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and the one who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 38 And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 39 The one who finds his life will lose it, and the one who loses his life because of me will find it. 40 “The one who receives you receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me. 41 The one who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and the one who receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward. 42 And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he will never lose his reward.” 1 And it happened that when Jesus had finished giving orders to his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and to preach in their towns. 2 Now when John heard in prison the deeds of Christ, he sent word by his disciples 3 and said to him, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?” 4 And Jesus answered and said to them, “Go and tell John what you hear and see: 5 the blind receive sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor have good news announced to them. 6 And whoever is not offended by me is blessed.” ",Matthew 10:9-11:6,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-109116-198660/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-07-22_matthew-109116_20110621121924.mp3
Matthew,"7 Now as these were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 8 But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings. 9 But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet! 10 It is this man about whom it is written: ‘Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’ 11 Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist. But the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 12 But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven is treated violently, and the violent claim it. 13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John, 14 and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah, the one who is going to come. 15 The one who has ears, let him hear! 16 “But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to one another, 17 saying, ‘We played the flute for you and you did not dance; we sang a lament and you did not mourn.’ 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’ 19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a man who is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.” 20 Then he began to reproach the towns in which the majority of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent: 21 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 22 Nevertheless I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon on the day of judgment than for you! 23 And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today. 24 Nevertheless I tell you that it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you!” 25 At that time Jesus answered and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to young children. 26 Yes, Father, for to do so was your gracious will. 27 All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wants to reveal him. 28 Come to me, all of you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke on you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy to carry and my burden is light.” 1 At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath. And his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck off heads of grain and eat them. 2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, “Behold, your disciples are doing what it is not permitted to do on the Sabbath!” ",Matthew 11:7-12:2,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-117122-198661/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-07-25_matthew-117122_20110621122057.mp3
Matthew,"3 So he said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those with him, 4 how he entered into the house of God and ate the bread of the presentation, which it was not permitted for him or for those with him to eat, but only for the priests? 5 Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the sanctity of the Sabbath and are guiltless? 6 But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here! 7 And if you had known what it means, ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. 8 For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.” 9 And going on from there he came into their synagogue. 10 And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand, and they asked him, saying, “Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath?” in order that they could accuse him. 11 But he said to them, “What man will there be among you who will have one sheep and if this one fell into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? 12 Then to what degree is a man worth more than a sheep? So then, it is permitted to do good on the Sabbath.” 13 Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand,” and he stretched it out, and it was restored as healthy as the other one. 14 But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him in order that they could destroy him. 15 Now Jesus, when he learned of it, withdrew from there, and many followed him, and he healed them all. 16 And he warned them that they should not reveal his identity, 17 in order that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, 18 “Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles. 19 He will not quarrel or cry out, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets. 20 A crushed reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not extinguish, until he brings justice to victory. 21 And in his name the Gentiles will hope. 22 Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to him. And he healed him so that the man who was mute could speak and see. 23 And all the crowds were amazed and began saying, “Perhaps this one is the Son of David!” 24 But the Pharisees, when they heard it, said, “This man does not expel demons except by Beelzebul the ruler of demons!” 25 But knowing their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. 26 And if Satan expels Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? 27 And if I expel demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons expel them? For this reason they will be your judges! 28 But if I expel demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you! 29 Or how can someone enter into the house of a strong man and steal his property, unless he first ties up the strong man? And then he can thoroughly plunder his house. 30 The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters. 31 For this reason I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven! 32 And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him either in this age or in the coming one! 33 “Either make the tree good and its fruit is good, or make the tree bad and its fruit is bad, for the tree is known by its fruit. 34 Offspring of vipers! How are you able to say good things when you are evil? For from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. 35 The good person from his good treasury brings out good things, and the evil person from his evil treasury brings out evil things. 36 But I tell you that every worthless word that they speak, people will give an account for it on the day of judgment! 37 For by your words you will be vindicated, and by your words you will be condemned.” 38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you!” 39 But he answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation desires a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah! 40 For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. 41 The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here! 42 The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here! 43 “Now whenever an unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it travels through waterless places searching for rest, and does not find it. 44 Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came out.’ And when it arrives it finds the house unoccupied and swept and put in order. 45 Then it goes and brings along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there. And the last state of that person becomes worse than the first. So it will be for this evil generation also!” 46 And while he was still speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and brothers were standing there outside, desiring to speak to him. 47 And someone told him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers are standing there outside desiring to speak to you.” 48 But he answered and said to the one who told him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?” 49 And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, “Behold my mother and my brothers! 50 For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother.” 1 On that day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea. 2 And large crowds gathered close around him, so that he got into a boat to sit down, and all the crowd was standing on the shore.

Matthew,"3 And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, “Behold, the sower went out to sow, 4 and while he was sowing, some seed fell on the side of the path, and the birds came and devoured it. 5 And other seed fell on the rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up at once because it did not have any depth of soil. 6 But when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it did not have enough root, it withered. 7 And other seed fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it. 8 But other seed fell on the good soil and produced grain, this one a hundred times as much and this one sixty and this one thirty. 9 The one who has ears, let him hear!” 10 And the disciples came up and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” 11 And he answered and said to them, “To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to those people it has not been granted. 12 For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. 13 For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand, 14 and with reference to them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says, “You will listen carefully and will never understand, and you will look closely and will never perceive. 15 For the heart of this people has become dull, and with their ears they hear with difficulty, and they have shut their eyes, so that they would not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.” 16 But your eyes are blessed because they see, and your ears because they hear. 17 For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it! 18 “You, therefore, listen to the parable of the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown on the side of the path. 20 And what was sown on the rocky ground—this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy. 21 But he does not have a root in himself, but lasts only a little while, and when affliction or persecution happens because of the word, immediately he falls away. 22 And what was sown into the thorn plants—this is the one who hears the word, and the anxiety of this world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word and it becomes unproductive. 23 But what was sown on the good soil—this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces, this one a hundred times as much, and this one sixty, and this one thirty.” ",Matthew 13:3-23,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-133-23-198663/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-07-27_matthew-133-23_20110621122257.mp3
Matthew,"24 He put before them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 But while his people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed darnel in the midst of the wheat and went away. 26 So when the wheat sprouted and yielded grain, then the darnel appeared also. 27 So the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have darnel?’ 28 And he said to them, ‘An enemy has done this!’ So the slaves said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’ 29 But he said, “No, lest when you gather the darnel you uproot the wheat together with it. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the season of the harvest I will tell the reapers, “First gather the darnel and tie it into bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my storehouse.” ’ ” 31 He put before them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. 32 It is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it is grown it is larger than the garden herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.” 33 He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and put into three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened.” 34 Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables, and he was saying nothing to them without a parable, 35 in order that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled, who said, “I will open my mouth in parables; I will proclaim what has been hidden since the creation.” 36 Then he left the crowds and came into the house, and his disciples came to him saying, “Explain the parable of the darnel in the field to us.” 37 So he answered and said, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, 38 and the field is the world. And the good seed—these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil one. 39 And the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. 40 Thus just as the darnel is gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at the end of the age. 41 The Son of Man will send out his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all the causes of sin and those who do lawless deeds, 42 and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth! 43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one who has ears, let him hear!

Matthew,"44 “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, that a man found and concealed, and in his joy he goes and sells everything that he has and buys that field. 45 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls. 46 And when he found one very valuable pearl, he went and sold everything that he possessed and purchased it. 47 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind, 48 which when it was filled they pulled to shore and sat down and collected the good fish into containers, but the bad they threw out. 49 Thus it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out and separate the evil from among the righteous 50 and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth! 51 “Have you understood all these things?” They said to him, “Yes.” 52 And he said to them, “For this reason every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of the house who brings out of his storeroom new things and old things.” 53 And it happened that when Jesus had finished these parables he went away from there. 54 And he came to his hometown and began to teach them in their synagogue, so that they were amazed and said, “From where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles? 55 Is not this one the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? 56 And are not all his sisters with us? From where then did this man get all these things?” 57 And they were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own hometown and in his own household.” 58 And he did not perform many miracles in that place because of their unbelief. 1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus ",Matthew 13:44-14:1,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-1344141-198665/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-07-29_matthew-1344141_20110621122516.mp3
Matthew,"1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus 2 and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist! He has been raised from the dead, and for this reason miraculous powers are at work in him.” 3 For Herod, after arresting John, bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, 4 because John had been saying to him, “It is not permitted for you to have her.” 5 And although he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they looked upon him as a prophet. 6 But when Herod’s birthday celebration took place, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst of them and pleased Herod. 7 Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. 8 And coached by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter!” 9 And although the king was distressed, because of his oaths and his dinner guests he commanded the request to be granted. 10 And he sent orders and had John beheaded in the prison, 11 and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. 12 And his disciples came and took away the corpse and buried it, and went and told Jesus. 13 Now when Jesus heard it, he withdrew from there in a boat to an isolated place by himself. And when the crowds heard it, they followed him by land from the towns. 14 And as he got out, he saw the large crowd and had compassion on them and healed their sick. 15 Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him saying, “The place is desolate and the hour is late. Release the crowds so that they can go away into the villages and purchase food for themselves.” 16 But Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.” 17 And they said to him, “We do not have anything here except five loaves and two fish.” 18 So he said, “Bring them here to me.” 19 And he commanded the crowds to recline for a meal on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks. And after breaking them, he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. 20 And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full. 21 Now those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children. 22 And immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent away the crowds. 23 And after he sent away the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. So when evening came, he was there alone. 24 But the boat was already many stadia distant from the land, being beaten by the waves, because the wind was against it. 25 And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. 26 But the disciples, when they saw him walking on the sea, were terrified, saying, “It is a ghost!” and they cried out in fear. 27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Have courage, I am he! Do not be afraid!” 28 And Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water!” 29 So he said, “Come!” And getting out of the boat, Peter walked on the water and came toward Jesus. 30 But when he saw the strong wind, he was afraid. And beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!” 31 And immediately Jesus extended his hand and caught him and said to him, “You of little faith! Why did you doubt?” 32 And when they got into the boat, the wind abated. 33 So those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God!” 34 And after they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. 35 And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent word into that whole surrounding region, and they brought to him all those who were sick. 36 And they were imploring him that they might only touch the edge of his cloak, and all those who touched it were cured.

Matthew,"1 Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying, 2 “Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat a meal.” 3 So he answered and said to them, “Why do you also break the commandment of God because of your tradition? 4 For God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother must certainly die.’ 5 But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or his mother, “Whatever benefit you would have received from me is a gift to God,” 6 need not honor his father,’ and you make void the word of God for the sake of your tradition. 7 Hypocrites! Isaiah correctly prophesied about you saying, 8 ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far, far away from me, 9 and they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ ” 10 And summoning the crowd, he said to them, “Hear and understand: 11 It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth—this defiles a person.” 12 Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?” 13 And he answered and said, “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted. 14 Let them! They are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.” 15 But Peter answered and said to him, “Explain this parable to us.” 16 But he said, “Are you also still without understanding? 17 Do you not understand that everything that enters into the mouth goes into the stomach and is evacuated into the latrine? 18 But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these defile the person. 19 For from the heart come evil plans, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, abusive speech. 20 These are the things that defile a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person!” 21 And departing from there, Jesus went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 22 And behold, a Canaanite woman from that district came and cried out, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!” 23 But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came up and asked him, saying, “Send her away, because she is crying out after us!” 24 But he answered and said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” 25 But she came and knelt down before him, saying, “Lord, help me!” 26 And he answered and said, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs!” 27 So she said, “Yes, Lord, for even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.” 28 Then Jesus answered and said to her, “O woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you want.” And her daughter was healed from that hour. 29 And departing from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and he went up on the mountain and was sitting there. 30 And large crowds came to him, having with them the mute, blind, lame, crippled, and many others, and they put them down at his feet, and he healed them. 31 So then the crowd was astonished when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel. 32 And Jesus summoned his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat, and I do not want to send them away hungry lest they give out on the way.” 33 And the disciples said to him, “Where in this desolate place can we get so much bread that such a great crowd could be satisfied?” 34 And Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” So they said, “Seven, and a few little fish.” 35 And commanding the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground, 36 he took the seven loaves and the fish and after he had given thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. 37 And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full. 38 Now those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children. 39 And after he sent away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.

Matthew,"1 And when the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test him, they asked him to show them a sign from heaven. 2 So he answered and said to them, “When evening comes you say, ‘It will be fair weather because the sky is red,’ 3 and early in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy weather, because the sky is red and darkening.’ You know how to evaluate correctly the appearance of the sky, but you are not able to evaluate the signs of the times. 4 An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah!” And he left them and went away. 5 And when the disciples arrived at the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. 6 And Jesus said to them, “Watch out for and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!” 7 So they were discussing this among themselves, saying, “It is because we did not take bread.” 8 But knowing this, Jesus said, “Why are you discussing among yourselves that you did not take bread, you of little faith? 9 Do you not yet understand or do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up? 10 Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up? 11 How do you not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!” 12 Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 13 Now when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he began asking his disciples, saying, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” 14 And they said, Some say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” 15 He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” 16 And Simon Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!” 17 And Jesus answered and said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. 18 And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it! 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven.” 20 Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was the Christ. 21 From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day. 22 And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, God forbid, Lord! This will never happen to you!” 23 But he turned around and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a cause for stumbling to me, because you are not intent on the things of God, but the things of people!” 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. 25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me will find it. 26 For what will a person be benefited if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? Or what will a person give in exchange for his life? 27 For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and at that time he will reward each one according to what he has done. 28 Truly I say to you, that there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.” ",Matthew 16:1-28,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-161-28-201257/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-08-03_matthew-161-28_20110628144821.mp3
Matthew,"28 Truly I say to you, that there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.” 1 And after six days Jesus took along Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves. 2 And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothing became bright as the light. 3 And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him. 4 So Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good that we are here! If you want, I will make here three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.” 5 While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!” 6 And when the disciples heard this, they fell down on their faces and were extremely frightened. 7 And Jesus came and touched them and said, “Get up and do not be afraid.” 8 And when they lifted up their eyes they saw no one except him—Jesus alone. 9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them saying, “Tell no one the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.” 10 And the disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” 11 And he answered and said, “Elijah indeed is coming, and will restore all things. 12 But I say to you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did with him whatever they wanted. In the same way also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.” 13 Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them about John the Baptist. 14 And when they came to the crowd, a man approached him, kneeling down before him 15 and saying, “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he has seizures and suffers severely, for often he falls into the fire and often into the water. 16 And I brought him to your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.” 17 And Jesus answered and said, “O unbelieving and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!” 18 And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him and the boy was healed from that hour. 19 Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and said, Why were we not able to expel it?” 20 And he said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.” 22 Now as they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men, 23 and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised.” And they were extremely distressed. 24 Now when they arrived in Capernaum, the ones who collected the double drachma tax came up to Peter and said, “Does your teacher not pay the double drachma tax?” 25 He said, “Yes.” And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tolls or taxes—from their own sons, or from foreigners?” 26 And when he said, “From foreigners,” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are free. 27 But so that we do not give offense to them, go out to the sea, cast a line with a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a four-drachma coin. Take that and give it to them for me and you.” ",Matthew 16:28-17:27,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-16281727-201266/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-08-04_matthew-16281727_20110713113258.mp3
Matthew,"1 At that time the disciples came up to Jesus, saying, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 2 And calling a child to himself, he had him stand in their midst 3 and said, “Truly I say to you, unless you turn around and become like young children, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven! 4 Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child, this person is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, 5 and whoever welcomes one child such as this in my name welcomes me. 6 But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him that a large millstone be hung on his neck and he be drowned in the depths of the sea. 7 Woe to the world because of causes for stumbling, for it is a necessity that causes for stumbling come; nevertheless, woe to the person through whom the cause for stumbling comes. 8 And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you! It is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than, having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into the eternal fire! 9 And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it from you! It is better for you to enter into life one-eyed than, having two eyes, to be thrown into fiery hell! 10 “See to it that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven constantly see the face of my Father who is in heaven. 12 What do you think? If a certain man has a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go and look for the one that wandered away? 13 And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not wander away. 14 In the same way it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish. 15 “Now if your brother sins against you, go correct him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. 16 But if he does not listen, take with you in addition one or two others, so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter may be established. 17 And if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses to listen to the church also, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. 18 “Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven. 19 Again, truly I say to you that if two of you agree on earth about any matter that they ask, it will be done for them from my Father who is in heaven. 20 For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there in the midst of them.” 21 Then Peter came up to him and said, “Lord, how many times will my brother sin against me and I will forgive him? Up to seven times?” 22 Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven! 23 “For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man—a king—who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves. 24 And when he began to settle them, someone was brought to him who owed ten thousand talents. 25 And because he did not have enough to repay it, the master ordered him to be sold, and his wife and his children and everything that he had, and to be repaid. 26 Then the slave threw himself to the ground and began to do obeisance to him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay back everything to you!’ 27 So the master of that slave, because he had compassion, released him and forgave him the loan. 28 But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and taking hold of him, he began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back everything that you owe!’ 29 Then his fellow slave threw himself to the ground and began to implore him, saying, ‘Be patient with me and I will repay you!’ 30 But he did not want to, but rather he went and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed. 31 So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were extremely distressed, and went and reported to their master everything that had happened. 32 Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘Wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you implored me! 33 Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I also showed mercy to you?’ 34 And because he was angry, his master handed him over to the merciless jailers until he would repay everything that was owed. 35 So also my heavenly Father will do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from your hearts!” ",Matthew 18,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-18-201269/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-08-05_matthew-18_20110628145210.mp3
Matthew,"1 And it happened that when Jesus had finished these statements, he went away from Galilee and came into the region of Judea on the other side of the Jordan. 2 And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. 3 And Pharisees came up to him in order to test him, and asked if it was permitted for a man to divorce his wife for any cause. 4 And he answered and said, “Have you not read that the one who created them from the beginning made them male and female 5 and said, ‘On account of this a man will leave his father and his mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’? 6 So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, man must not separate.” 7 They said to him, “Why then did Moses command us to give a document—a certificate of divorce—and to divorce her?” 8 He said to them, “Moses, with reference to your hardness of heart, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not like this. 9 Now I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the basis of sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery, and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.” 10 The disciples said to him, “If this is the case of a man with his wife, it would be better not to marry!” 11 But he said to them, “Not everyone can accept this saying but those to whom it has been given. 12 For there are eunuchs who were born as such from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by people, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who is able to accept this, let him accept it.” 13 Then children were brought to him so that he could lay his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. 14 But Jesus said, “Allow the children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.” 15 And he laid his hands on them and traveled on from there.

Matthew,"14 But Jesus said, “Allow the children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.” 15 And he laid his hands on them and traveled on from there. 16 And behold, someone came up to him and said, “Teacher, what good thing must I do so that I will have eternal life?” 17 And he said to him, “Why are you asking me about what is good? There is one who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments!” 18 He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “Do not commit murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, 19 honor your father and your mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.” 20 The young man said to him, “All these I have observed. What do I still lack?” 21 Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give the proceeds to the poor—and you will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me.” 22 But when the young man heard the statement, he went away sorrowful, because he was one who had many possessions. 23 And Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I say to you that with difficulty a rich person will enter into the kingdom of heaven! 24 And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich person into the kingdom of God.” 25 So when the disciples heard this, they were extremely amazed, saying, “Then who can be saved?” 26 But Jesus looked at them and said to them, “With human beings this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” 27 Then Peter answered and said to him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?” 28 And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that in the renewal of the world, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me—you also will sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields on account of my name will receive a hundred times as much, and will inherit eternal life. 30 But many who are first will be last, and the last first. 1 “For the kingdom of heaven is like a man—the master of the house—who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. 2 And after coming to an agreement with the workers for a denarius per day, he sent them into his vineyard. 3 And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace. 4 And to those people he said, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever is right.’ 5 So they went. Going out again about the sixth and ninth hour he did the same thing. 6 And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing there and said to them, ‘Why are you standing here the whole day unemployed?’ 7 They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go also into the vineyard.’ 8 And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last up to the first.’ 9 And when the ones hired about the eleventh hour came, they received a denarius apiece. 10 And when the first came, they thought that they would receive more, and they also received a denarius apiece. 11 And when they received it, they began to complain against the master of the house, 12 saying, ‘These last people worked one hour and you made them equal to us who have endured the burden of the day and the burning heat!’ 13 But he answered one of them and said, ‘Friend, I am not doing you wrong. Did you not come to an agreement with me for a denarius? 14 Take what is yours and go! But I want to give to this last person the same as I gave to you also. 15 Is it not permitted for me to do whatever I want with what is mine? Or is your eye evil because I am generous?’ 16 Thus the last will be first and the first last.” 17 And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples by themselves and said to them on the way, 18 “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, 19 and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock him and flog him and crucify him, and on the third day he will be raised.” 20 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and kneeling down she asked something from him. 21 And he said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Say that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom.” 22 But Jesus answered and said, “You do not know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.” 23 He said to them, “You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.” ",Matthew 19:14-20:23,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-19142023-201273/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-08-09_matthew-19142023_20110628145223.mp3
Matthew,"24 And when the ten heard this, they were indignant concerning the two brothers. 25 But Jesus called them to himself and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions exercise authority over them. 26 It will not be like this among you! But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 27 and whoever wants to be most prominent among you must be your slave—28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” 29 And as they were going out of Jericho, a large crowd followed him. 30 And behold, there were two blind men sitting beside the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they called out, saying, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 31 And the crowd rebuked them so that they would be quiet. But they called out all the more, saying, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 32 And Jesus stopped, called them, and said, “What do you want me to do for you?” 33 They said to him, “Lord, that our eyes be opened!” 34 And having compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed him. 1 And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 2 saying to them, “Go into the village before you, and right away you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. 3 And if anyone says anything to you, you will say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.” 4 Now this took place so that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying, 5 “Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your king is coming to you, humble and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a pack animal.’ ” 6 So the disciples went and did just as Jesus directed them, 7 and brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them, and he sat on them. 8 And a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road. 9 And the crowds who went ahead of him and the ones who followed were shouting, saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!” 10 And when he entered into Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?” 11 And the crowds were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee!” 12 And Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who were selling doves. 13 And he said to them, “It is written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a cave of robbers!” 14 And the blind and the lame came up to him in the temple courts and he healed them. 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children shouting in the temple courts and saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were indignant. 16 And they said to him, “Do you hear what these children are saying?” So Jesus said to them, “Yes, have you never read, ‘Out of the mouths of children and nursing babies you have prepared for yourself praise’?” 17 And leaving them, he went outside of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.

Matthew,"18 Now early in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry. 19 And seeing a single fig tree by the road, he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And he said to it, “May there be no more fruit from you forever, and the fig tree withered at once. 20 And when they saw it, the disciples were astonished, saying, “How did the fig tree wither at once?” 21 And Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will do not only what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,” it will happen! 22 And whatever you ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive.” 23 And after he arrived at the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him while he was teaching, saying, “By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?” 24 And Jesus answered and said to them, “I also will ask you one question. If you tell the answer to me, I also will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 25 From where was the baptism of John—from heaven or from men?” And they began to discuss this among themselves, saying, “If we say ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ 26 But if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid of the crowd, because they all look upon John as a prophet.” 27 And they answered and said to Jesus, “We do not know.” And he said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things. 28 “Now what do you think? A man had two sons. He approached the first and said, ‘Son, go work in the vineyard today.’ 29 And he answered and said, ‘I do not want to!’ But later he changed his mind and went. 30 And he approached the second and said the same thing. So he answered and said, ‘I will, sir,’ and he did not go. 31 Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the kingdom of God! 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did believe him. And when you saw it, you did not even change your minds later so as to believe in him. 33 “Listen to another parable: There was a man—a master of a house—who planted a vineyard, and put a fence around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey. 34 And when the season of fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the tenant farmers to collect his fruit. 35 And the tenant farmers seized his slaves, one of whom they beat, and one of whom they killed, and one of whom they stoned. 36 Again, he sent other slaves, more than the first ones, and they did the same thing to them. 37 So finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ 38 But when the tenant farmers saw the son, they said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance!’ 39 And they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. 40 Now when the master of the vineyard arrives, what will he do to those tenant farmers?” 41 They said to him, “He will destroy those evil men completely and lease the vineyard to other tenant farmers who will give him the fruits in their season.” 42 Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the cornerstone. This came about from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’? 43 For this reason, I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a people who produce its fruits. 44 And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls—it will crush him!” 45 And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was speaking about them, 46 and although they wanted to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, because they looked upon him as a prophet. 1 And continuing, Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying, 2 “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man—a king—who gave a wedding celebration for his son. 3 And he sent his slaves to summon those who had been invited to the wedding celebration, and they did not want to come. 4 Again he sent other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding celebration!” ’ 5 But they paid no attention and went away—this one to his own field, that one to his business. 6 And the others, seizing his slaves, mistreated them and killed them. 7 And the king was angry and sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. 8 Then he said to his slaves, ‘The wedding celebration is ready, but those who had been invited were not worthy. 9 Therefore, go out to the places where the roads exit the city and invite to the wedding celebration as many people as you find.’ 10 And those slaves went out into the roads and gathered everyone whom they found, both evil and good, and the wedding celebration was filled with dinner guests. 11 But when the king came in to see the dinner guests, he saw a man there not dressed in wedding clothes. 12 And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here, not having wedding clothes?’ But he could say nothing. 13 Then the king said to the servants, ‘Tie him up hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!’ 14 For many are called but few are chosen.” ",Matthew 21:18-22:14,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-21182214-201277/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-08-11_matthew-21182214_20110628145410.mp3
Matthew,"15 Then the Pharisees went and consulted so that they could entrap him with a statement. 16 And they sent their disciples to him with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care what anyone thinks, because you do not regard the opinion of people. 17 Therefore tell us what you think. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” 18 But because he knew their maliciousness, Jesus said, “Hypocrites! Why are you testing me? 19 Show me the coin for the tax!” So they brought him a denarius. 20 And he said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?” 21 They said to him, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!” 22 And when they heard this, they were astonished, and they left him and went away. 23 On that day Sadducees—who say there is no resurrection—came up to him and asked him, 24 saying, “Teacher, Moses said if someone dies without having children, his brother is to marry his wife and father descendants for his brother. 25 Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first died after getting married, and because he did not have descendants, he left his wife to his brother. 26 So also the second and the third, up to the seventh. 27 And last of all the woman died. 28 In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her as wife.” 29 But Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God! 30 For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven. 31 Now concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who said, 32 “I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob”? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living!” 33 And when the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. 34 Now when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they assembled at the same place. 35 And one of them, a legal expert, put a question to him to test him: 36 “Teacher, which commandment is greatest in the law?” 37 And he said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ 38 This is the greatest and first commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40 On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.” 41 Now while the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them, 42 saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “David’s.” 43 He said to them, “How then does David, by the Spirit, call him ‘Lord,’ saying, 44 ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet” ’? 45 If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how is he his son?” 46 And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask him any more questions. 1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples, 2 saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on the seat of Moses. 3 Therefore do and observe everything that they tell you, but do not do as they do, for they tell others to do something and do not do it themselves. 4 And they tie up heavy burdens and put them on people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing with their finger to move them. 5 And they do all their deeds in order to be seen by people, for they make their phylacteries broad and make their tassels long. 6 And they love the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues 7 and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by people. 8 But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ because one is your teacher, and you are all brothers, 9 And do not call anyone your father on earth, for one is your heavenly Father. 10 And do not be called teachers, because one is your teacher, the Christ. 11 And the greatest among you will be your servant. 12 And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. 13 “But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you shut the kingdom of heaven before people! For you do not enter, nor permit those wanting to go in to enter. 15 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you travel around the sea and the dry land to make one convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are! 16 “Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing! But whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound by his oath.’ 17 Fools and blind people! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy? 18 And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing! But whoever swears by the gift that is on it is bound by his oath.’ 19 Blind people! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy? 20 Therefore the one who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything that is on it. 21 And the one who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. 22 And the one who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by the one who sits on it.

Matthew,"23 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you pay a tenth of mint and dill and cumin, and neglect the more important matters of the law—justice and mercy and faithfulness! It was necessary to do these things while not neglecting those. 24 Blind guides who filter out a gnat and swallow a camel! 25 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence! 26 Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean also. 27 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and of everything unclean! 28 In the same way, on the outside you also appear righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. 29 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous, 30 and you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in the blood of the prophets!’ 31 Thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets! 32 And you—fill up the measure of your fathers! 33 Serpents! Offspring of vipers! How will you escape from the condemnation to hell? 34 For this reason, behold, I am sending to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and will pursue from town to town, 35 so that upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of righteous Abel up to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. 36 Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation! 37 “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!

Truly I say to you, not one stone will be left here on another stone that will not be thrown down!” 3 And as he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came up to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” ",Matthew 23:23-24:3,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-2323243-204459/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-08-15_matthew-2323243_20110712133257.mp3

See to it that you are not alarmed, for this must happen, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 But all these things are the beginning of birth pains. 9 “Then they will hand you over to persecution and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of my name. 10 And then many will be led into sin and will betray one another and will hate one another, 11 and many false prophets will appear and will deceive many, 12 and because lawlessness will increase, the love of many will grow cold. 13 But the one who endures to the end—this person will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.

Matthew,"14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. 15 “So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken about by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place” (let the one who reads understand), 16 “then those in Judea must flee to the mountains! 17 The one who is on his housetop must not come down to take things out of his house, 18 and the one who is in the field must not turn back to pick up his cloak. 19 And woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days! 20 But pray that your flight may not happen in winter or on a Sabbath. 21 For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not happened from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will happen. 22 And unless those days had been shortened, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened. 23 “At that time if anyone should say to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or ‘Here he is,’ do not believe him! 24 For false messiahs and false prophets will appear, and will produce great signs and wonders in order to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 25 Behold, I have told you ahead of time! 26 Therefore if they say to you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or ‘Behold, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it! 27 For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so the coming of the Son of Man will be. 28 Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather. 29 “And immediately after the tribulation of those days, ‘the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven will be shaken.’ 30 And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man arriving on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31 And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect together from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other end of it. 32 “Now learn the parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.

Matthew,"32 “Now learn the parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. 33 So also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near, at the door. 34 Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all these things take place! 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 36 “But concerning that day and hour no one knows—not even the angels of heaven nor the Son—except the Father alone. 37 For just as the days of Noah were, so the coming of the Son of Man will be. 38 For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered into the ark. 39 And they did not know anything until the deluge came and swept them all away. So also the coming of the Son of Man will be. 40 Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one left. 41 Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. 42 Therefore be on the alert, because you do not know what day your Lord is coming! 43 But understand this: that if the master of the house had known what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. 44 For this reason you also must be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think he will come. 45 “Who then is the faithful and wise slave whom the master has put in charge of his household slaves to give them their food at the right time? 46 Blessed is that slave whom his master will find so doing when he comes back. 47 Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions. 48 But if that evil slave should say to himself, ‘My master is staying away for a long time,’ 49 and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards, 50 the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know, 51 and will cut him in two and assign his place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth! 1 “Then the kingdom of heaven may be compared to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2 Now five of them were foolish and five were wise. 3 For when the foolish ones took their lamps, they did not take olive oil with them. 4 But the wise ones took olive oil in flasks with their lamps. 5 And when the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. 6 But in the middle of the night there was a shout, ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’ 7 Then all those virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 8 And the foolish ones said to the wise ones, ‘Give us some of your olive oil, because our lamps are going out!’ 9 But the wise ones answered saying, “Certainly there will never be enough for us and for you! Go instead to those who sell olive oil and buy some for yourselves.’ 10 But while they had gone away to buy it the bridegroom arrived, and those who were ready went inside with him to the wedding celebration, and the door was shut. 11 And later the other virgins came also, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open the door for us!’ 12 But he answered and said, ‘Truly I say to you, I do not know you!’ 13 Therefore be on the alert, because you do not know the day or the hour! 14 For it is like a man going on a journey. He summoned his own slaves and handed over his property to them. 15 And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each one according to his own ability, and he went on a journey immediately. 16 The one who had received the five talents went out and traded with them and gained five more. 17 In the same way the one who had the two gained two more. 18 But the one who had received the one went away and dug up the ground and hid his master’s money. 19 Now after a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them. 20 And the one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me five talents. See, I have gained five more talents!’ 21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’ 22 And the one who had the two talents also came up and said, ‘Master, you handed over to me two talents. See, I have gained two talents more!’ 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’ 24 And the one who had received the one talent came up also and said, ‘Master, because I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering from where you did not scatter seed. 25 And because I was afraid, I went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours!’ 26 But his master answered and said to him, ‘Evil and lazy slave! You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather from where I did not scatter seed. 27 Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and when I returned I would have gotten back what was mine with interest! 28 Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents. 29 For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. 30 And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness—in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!’ ",Matthew 24:32-25:30,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-24322530-204462/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-08-18_matthew-24322530_20110712133553.mp3
Matthew,"31 Now when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them from one another like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 And he will place the sheep on his right and the goats on the left. 34 Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world! 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me as a guest, 36 I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you cared for me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ 37 Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you as a guest, or naked and clothe you? 39 And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?’ 40 And the king will answer and say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, in as much as you did it to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did it to me.’ 41 Then he will also say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you accursed ones, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels! 42 For I was hungry and you did not give me anything to eat, I was thirsty and you did not give me anything to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not welcome me as a guest, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not care for me.’ 44 Then they will also answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and not serve you?’ 45 Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly I say to you, in as much as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ 46 And these will depart into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.” 1 And it happened that when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, 2 “You know that after two days the Passover takes place, and the Son of Man will be handed over in order to be crucified.” 3 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas, 4 and plotted in order that they could arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. 5 But they were saying, “Not during the feast, so that there will not be an uproar among the people.” 6 Now while Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, 7 a woman came up to him holding an alabaster flask of very expensive perfumed oil, and poured it out on his head while he was reclining at table. 8 And when the disciples saw it they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste? 9 For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor!” 10 But Jesus, knowing this, said to them, “Why do you cause trouble for the woman? For she has done a good deed for me. 11 For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me. 12 For when this woman poured this ointment on my body, she did it in order to prepare me for burial. 13 Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.” 14 Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 15 and said, “What are you willing to give me if I in turn deliver him to you?” So they set out for him thirty silver coins. 16 And from that time on, he began seeking a favorable opportunity in order that he could betray him. 17 Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came up to Jesus, saying, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?” 18 And he said, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I am celebrating the Passover with you with my disciples.” ’ 19 And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the Passover. 20 And when it was evening, he was reclining at table with the twelve disciples. 21 And while they were eating he said, “Truly I say to you, that one of you will betray me.” 22 And greatly distressed, each one began to say to him, “Surely I am not he, am I, Lord?” ",Matthew 25:31-26:22,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-25312622-204463/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-08-19_matthew-25312622_20110712133602.mp3
Matthew,"23 And he answered and said, “The one who dips his hand in the bowl with me—this one will betray me. 24 The Son of Man is going just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if that man had not been born.” 25 And Judas, the one who was betraying him, answered and said, “Surely I am not he, am I, Rabbi?” He said to him, “You have said it.” 26 Now while they were eating Jesus took bread and, after giving thanks, he broke it, and giving it to the disciples, he said, “Take, eat, this is my body.” 27 And after taking the cup and giving thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you, 28 for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 29 But I tell you, from now on I will never drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.” 30 And after they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 31 Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away because of me during this night, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ 32 But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” 33 But Peter answered and said to him, “If they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away!” 34 Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that during this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times!” 35 Peter said to him, “Even if it is necessary for me to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the disciples said the same thing. 36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” 37 And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be distressed and troubled. 38 Then he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.” 39 And going forward a little he fell down on his face, praying and saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.” 40 And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “So, were you not able to stay awake with me one hour? 41 Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak!” 42 Again for the second time he went away and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will must be done.” 43 And he came again and found them sleeping, for they could not keep their eyes open. 44 And leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing again. 45 Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. 46 Get up, let us go! Behold, the one who is betraying me is approaching!” 47 And while he was still speaking, behold, Judas—one of the twelve—arrived, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 48 Now the one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, “The one whom I kiss—he is the one. Arrest him!” 49 And he came up to Jesus immediately and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him. 50 And Jesus said to him, “Friend, do that for which you have come.” Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him. 51 And behold, one of those with Jesus extended his hand and drew his sword, and striking the slave of the high priest, cut off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place! For all who take up the sword will die by the sword. 53 Or do you think that I cannot call upon my Father, and he would put at my disposal at once more than twelve legions of angels? 54 How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must happen in this way?” 55 At that time Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to arrest me? Every day in the temple courts I sat teaching, and you did not arrest me! 56 But all this has happened in order that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then the disciples all abandoned him and fled. 57 Now those who had arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. 58 But Peter was following him from a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And he went inside and was sitting with the officers to see the outcome. 59 Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order that they could put him to death. 60 And they did not find it, although many false witnesses came forward. And finally two came forward 61 and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it within three days.’ ” 62 And the high priest stood up and said to him, “Do you reply nothing? What are these people testifying against you?” 63 But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I put you under oath by the living God, that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!” 64 Jesus said to him, “You have said it. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.” 65 Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have just now heard the blasphemy! 66 What do you think?” And they answered and said, “He deserves death!” 67 Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists, and they slapped him, 68 saying, “Prophesy for us, you Christ! Who is it who hit you?” 69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a female slave came up to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.” 70 But he denied it in the presence of them all, saying, “I do not know what you mean!” 71 And when he went out to the gateway, another female slave saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.” 72 And again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!” 73 And after a little while those who were standing there came up and said to Peter, “You really are one of them also, because even your accent reveals who you are.” 74 Then he began to curse and to swear with an oath, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed. 75 And Peter remembered the statement Jesus had said, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times,” and he went outside and wept bitterly.

Matthew,"1 Now when it was early morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus in order to put him to death. 2 And after tying him up, they led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor. 3 Then when Judas, the one who had betrayed him, saw that he had been condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders, 4 saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood!” But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it!” 5 And throwing the silver coins into the temple he departed. And he went away and hanged himself. 6 But the chief priests took the silver coins and said, “It is not permitted to put them into the temple treasury, because it is blood money.” 7 And after taking counsel, they purchased with them the Potter’s Field, for a burial place for strangers. 8 (For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood until today.) 9 Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, who said, “And they took the thirty silver coins, the price of the one who had been priced, on whom a price had been set by the sons of Israel, 10 and they gave them for the potter’s field, just as the Lord directed me.” 11 So Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And Jesus said, “You say so.” 12 And when he was being accused by the chief priests and elders he answered nothing. 13 Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?” 14 And he did not reply to him, not even with reference to one statement, so that the governor was very astonished. 15 Now at each feast, the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd—the one whom they wanted. 16 And at that time they had a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas. 17 So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you—Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?” 18 (For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy. 19 And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much as a result of a dream today because of him.”) 20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas and put Jesus to death. 21 So the governor answered and said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas!” 22 Pilate said to them, “What then should I do with Jesus, the one who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!” 23 And he said, “Why? What wrong has he done?” But they began to shout even louder, saying, “Let him be crucified!” 24 So Pilate, when he saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but instead an uproar was developing, took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this man. You see to it!” 25 And all the people answered and said, “His blood be on us and on our children!” 26 Then he released Barabbas for them, but after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over so that he could be crucified. 27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s residence and gathered the whole cohort to him. 28 And they stripped him and put a scarlet military cloak around him, 29 and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling down before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!” 30 And they spat on him and took the reed and repeatedly struck him on his head. 31 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the military cloak and put his own clothes on him, and led him away in order to crucify him. 32 And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon. They forced this man to carry his cross. 33 And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull), 34 they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink, and when he tasted it he did not want to drink it. 35 And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots. 36 And they sat down and were watching over him there. 37 And they put above his head the charge against him in writing: “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.” 38 Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. 39 And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads 40 and saying, “The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!” 41 In the same way also the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking him, saying, 42 “He saved others; he is not able to save himself! He is the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him! 43 He trusts in God; let him deliver him now if he wants to, because he said, ‘I am the Son of God’!” 44 And in the same way even the robbers who were crucified with him were reviling him. 45 Now from the sixth hour, darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour. 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” (that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”) 47 And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, said, “This man is summoning Elijah!” 48 And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. 49 But the others said, “Leave him alone! let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.” 50 And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.

Matthew,"50 And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit. 51 And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook and the rocks were split. 52 And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, 53 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many. 54 Now the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that took place, were extremely frightened, saying, “Truly this man was God’s Son!” 55 And there were many women there, observing from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him, 56 among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 57 Now when it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who also was a disciple of Jesus himself. 58 This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. 59 And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 60 and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a large stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. 61 Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb. 62 Now on the next day, which is after the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate, 63 saying, “Sir, we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise.’ 64 Therefore give orders that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him and tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.” 65 Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you know how.” 66 So they went with the guard of soldiers and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone. 1 Now after the Sabbath, at the dawning on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to view the tomb. 2 And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came up and rolled away the stone and sat down on it. 3 Now his appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow. 4 And the guards trembled from the fear of him and became like dead men. 5 But the angel answered and said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here, for he has been raised, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying. 7 And go quickly, tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and behold, he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there.’ Behold, I have told you.” 8 And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 And behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. 10 Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid! Go tell my brothers that they should go to Galilee, and there they will see me.” 11 And while they were going, behold, some of the guard of soldiers went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. 12 And after they had assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a rather large sum of money to the soldiers, 13 telling them, “Say ‘His disciples came during the night and stole him while we were sleeping.’ 14 And if this matter is heard before the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.” 15 So they took the money and did as they were told, and spread abroad this report among the Jews until this very day. 16 So the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated for them. 17 And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted. 18 And Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the age.” ",Matthew 27:50-28:20,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/matthew-27502820-204466/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-08-24_matthew-27502820_20110712133907.mp3

Genesis,"2 Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. 3 And God said, “Let there be light!” And there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good, and God caused there to be a separation between the light and between the darkness. 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day. 6 And God said, “Let there be a vaulted dome in the midst of the waters, and let it cause a separation between the waters.” 7 So God made the vaulted dome, and he caused a separation between the waters which were under the vaulted dome and between the waters which were over the vaulted dome. And it was so. 8 And God called the vaulted dome “heaven.” And there was evening, and there was morning, a second day. 9 And God said, “Let the waters under heaven be gathered to one place, and let the dry ground appear.” And it was so. 10 And God called the dry ground “earth,” and he called the collection of the waters “seas.” And God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, “Let the earth produce green plants that will bear seed—fruit trees bearing fruit in which there is seed—according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth green plants bearing seed according to its kind, and trees bearing fruit in which there was seed according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. 14 And God said, “Let there be lights in the vaulted dome of heaven to separate day from night, and let them be as signs and for appointed times, and for days and years, 15 and they shall be as lights in the vaulted dome of heaven to give light on the earth.” And it was so. 16 And God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night, and the stars. 17 And God placed them in the vaulted dome of heaven to give light on the earth 18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. 20 And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly over the earth across the face of the vaulted dome of heaven. 21 So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kind, and every bird with wings according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.” 23 And there was evening, and there was morning, a fifth day. 24 And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind: cattle and moving things, and wild animals according to their kind.” And it was so. 25 So God made wild animals according to their kind and the cattle according to their kind, and every creeping thing of the earth according to its kind.

Genesis,"26 And God said, “Let us make humankind in our image and according to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of heaven, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every moving thing that moves upon the earth.” 27 So God created humankind in his image, in the likeness of God he created him, male and female he created them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of heaven, and over every animal that moves upon the earth.” 29 And God said, “Look—I am giving to you every plant that bears seed which is on the face of the whole earth, and every kind of tree that bears fruit. They shall be yours as food.” 30 And to every kind of animal of the earth and to every bird of heaven, and to everything that moves upon the earth in which there is life I am giving every green plant as food.” And it was so. 31 And God saw everything that he had made and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning, a sixth day. 1 And heaven and earth and all their array were finished. 2 And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. 3 And God blessed the seventh day, and he sanctified it, because on it he rested from all his work of creating that there was to do.

Genesis,"4 These are the generations of heaven and earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made earth and heaven—5 before any plant of the field was on earth, and before any plant of the field had sprung up, because Yahweh God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no human being to cultivate the ground, 6 but a stream would rise from the earth and water the whole face of the ground—7 when Yahweh God formed the man of dust from the ground, and he blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. 8 And Yahweh God planted a garden in Eden in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed. 9 And Yahweh God caused to grow from the ground every tree that was pleasing to the sight and good for food. And the tree of life was in the midst of the garden, along with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 10 Now a river flowed out from Eden that watered the garden, and from there it diverged and became four branches. 11 The name of the first is the Pishon. It went around all the land of Havilah, where there is gold. 12 (The gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stones are there.) 13 And the name of the second is Gihon. It went around all the land of Cush. 14 And the name of the third is Tigris. It flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. 15 And Yahweh God took the man and set him in the garden of Eden to cultivate it and to keep it. 16 And Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “From every tree of the garden you may freely eat, 17 but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you shall surely die.” 18 Then Yahweh God said, “it is not good that the man is alone. I will make for him a helper as his counterpart.” 19 And out of the ground Yahweh God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, and he brought each to the man to see what he would call it. And whatever the man called that living creature was its name. 20 And the man gave names to every domesticated animal and to the birds of heaven and to all the wild animals. But for the man there was not found a helper as his counterpart. 21 And Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man. While he slept, he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh where it had been. 22 And Yahweh God fashioned the rib which he had taken from the man into a woman and brought her to the man. 23 And the man said, “She is now bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh; she shall be called ‘Woman,’ for she was taken from man.” 24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cling to his wife, and they shall be as one flesh. 25 And the man and his wife, both of them, were naked, and they were not ashamed.

Genesis,"1 Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God indeed say, ‘You shall not eat from any tree in the garden’?” 2 The woman said to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat, 3 but from the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, God said, ‘You shall not eat from it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die’.” 4 But the serpent said to the woman, “You shall not surely die. 5 For God knows that on the day you both eat from it, then your eyes will be opened and you both shall be like gods, knowing good and evil.” 6 When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes, and the tree was desirable to make one wise, then she took from its fruit and she ate. And she gave it also to her husband with her, and he ate. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed together fig leaves and they made for themselves coverings. 8 Then they heard the sound of Yahweh God walking in the garden at the windy time of day. And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden. 9 And Yahweh God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?” 10 And he replied, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid because I am naked, so I hid myself.” 11 Then he asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree from which I forbade you to eat?” 12 And the man replied, “The woman whom you gave to be with me—she gave to me from the tree and I ate.” 13 Then Yahweh God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” And the woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” ",Genesis 3:1-13,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/genesis-31-13-177851/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-04-25_genesis-31-13_20110406222127.mp3
Genesis,"14 Then Yahweh God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, you will be cursed more than any domesticated animal and more than any wild animal. On your belly you shall go and dust you shall eat all the days of your life. 15 And I will put hostility between you and between the woman, and between your offspring and between her offspring; he will strike you on the head, and you will strike him on the heel.” 16 To the woman he said, “I will greatly increase your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bear children. And to your husband shall be your desire. And he shall rule over you.” 17 And to Adam he said, “Because you listened to the voice of your wife and you ate from the tree from which I forbade you to eat, the ground shall be cursed on your account. In pain you shall eat from it all the days of your life. 18 And thorns and thistles shall sprout for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field. 19 By the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread, until your return to the ground. For from it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.” 20 And the man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all life. 21 And Yahweh God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and he clothed them. 22 And Yahweh God said, “Look—the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil. What if he stretches out his hand and takes also from the tree of life and eats, and lives forever?” 23 And Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. 24 So he drove the man out, and placed cherubim east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming, turning sword to guard the way to the tree of life. 1 Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain. And she said, “I have given birth to a man with the help of Yahweh.” 2 Then she bore his brother Abel. And Abel became a keeper of sheep, and Cain became a tiller of the ground. 3 And in the course of time Cain brought an offering from the fruit of the ground to Yahweh, 4 and Abel also brought an offering from the choicest firstlings of his flock. And Yahweh looked with favor to Abel and to his offering, 5 but to Cain and to his offering he did not look with favor. And Cain became very angry, and his face fell.

Genesis,"6 And Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why is your face fallen? 7 If you do well will I not accept you? But if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. And its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.” 8 Then Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out into the field.” And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him. 9 Then Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” And he said, “I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?” 10 And he said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground. 11 So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive the blood of your brother from your hand. 12 When you till the ground it shall no longer yield its strength to you. You shall be a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth.” 13 And Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. 14 Look, you have driven me out today from the face of the ground, and from your face I must hide. I will be a wanderer and a fugitive on the earth, and it will happen that whoever finds me will kill me.” 15 Then Yahweh said to him, “Therefore, whoever kills Cain will be avenged sevenfold.” Then Yahweh put a sign on Cain so that whoever found him would not kill him. 16 And Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh, and he settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. 17 And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. And when he built a city he named the city after his son, Enoch. 18 And to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. 19 And Lamech took to himself two wives. The name of the first was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah. 20 And Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and those who have livestock. 21 And the name of his brother was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and wind instruments. 22 Then Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-Cain who forged all kinds of tools of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah. 23 Then Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice; O wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, Even a young man for injuring me. 24 If Cain is avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech will be avenged seventy and seven times. 25 Then Adam knew his wife again, and she gave birth to a son. And she called his name Seth, for she said “God has appointed to me another child in the place of Abel, because Cain killed him.” 26 And as for Seth, he also fathered a son, and he called his name Enosh. At that time he began to call on the name of Yahweh. 1 This is the record of the generations of Adam. When God created Adam, he made him in the likeness of God. 2 Male and female he created them. And he blessed them. And he called their name “Humankind” when they were created. 3 And when Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he fathered a child in his likeness, according to his image. And he called his name Seth. 4 And the days of Adam after he fathered Seth were eight hundred years. And he fathered sons and daughters. 5 And all the days of Adam which he lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died. 6 When Seth had lived one hundred and five years, he fathered Enosh. 7 And after Seth had fathered Enosh he lived eight hundred and seven years, and fathered sons and daughters. 8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died. 9 When Enosh lived ninety years, he fathered Kenan. 10 And after Enosh fathered Kenan he lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and fathered sons and daughters. 11 And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died. 12 When Kenan had lived seventy years, he fathered Mahalalel. 13 And after Kenan had fathered Mahalalel, he lived eight hundred and forty years, and fathered sons and daughters. 14 And all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died. 15 When Mahalalel had lived sixty-five years, he fathered Jared. 16 And after Mahalalel had fathered Jared, he lived eight hundred and thirty years, and fathered sons and daughters. 17 And all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died. 18 When Jared had lived one hundred and sixty-two years, he fathered Enoch. 19 And after Jared had fathered Enoch, he lived eight hundred years, and fathered sons and daughters. 20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died. 21 When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he fathered Methuselah. 22 And Enoch walked with God after he fathered Methuselah three hundred years, and fathered sons and daughters.

Genesis,"23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. 24 And Enoch walked with God, and he was no more, for God took him. 25 When Methuselah had lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, he fathered Lamech. 26 And after Methuselah had fathered Lamech, he lived seven hundred and eighty-two years, and fathered sons and daughters. 27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died. 28 When Lamech had lived one hundred and eighty-two years, he fathered a son. 29 And he called his name Noah, saying, “This one shall relieve us from our work, and from the hard labor of our hands, from the ground which Yahweh had cursed. 30 And after Lamech had fathered Noah he lived five hundred and ninety-five years, and he fathered sons and daughters. 31 All the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died. 32 When Noah was five hundred years old, Noah fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 1 And it happened that, when humankind began to multiply on the face of the ground, daughters were born to them. 2 Then the sons of God saw the daughters of humankind, that they were beautiful. And they took for themselves wives from all that they chose. 3 And Yahweh said, “My Spirit shall not abide with humankind forever in that he is also flesh. And his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.” 4 The Nephilim were upon the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God went into the daughters of humankind, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty warriors that were from ancient times, men of renown. 5 And Yahweh saw that the evil of humankind was great upon the earth, and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was always only evil. 6 And Yahweh regretted that he had made humankind on the earth, and he was grieved in his heart. 7 And Yahweh said, “I will destroy humankind whom I created from upon the face of the earth, from humankind, to animals, to creeping things, and to the birds of heaven, for I regret that I have made them.” 8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh. 9 These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, without defect in his generations. Noah walked with God. 10 And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 11 And the earth was corrupted before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12 And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth. 13 And God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth was filled with violence because of them. Now, look, I am going to destroy them along with the earth.

Genesis,"14 Make for yourself an ark of cypress wood; you must make the ark with rooms, then you must cover it with pitch, inside and outside. 15 And this is how you must make it: the length of the ark, three hundred cubits; its width fifty cubits; its height, thirty cubits. 16 You must make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above. And as for the door of the ark, you must put it in its side. You must make it with a lower, second, and a third deck. 17 And I, behold, I am about to bring the flood waters over the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life from under the heaven; everything that is on the earth shall perish. 18 And I will establish my covenant with you, and you must go into the ark—you, and your sons, and your wife, and the wives of your sons with you. 19 And of every living thing, from all flesh, you must bring two from every kind into the ark to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. 20 From the birds according to their kind, and from the animals according to their kind, from every creeping thing on the ground according to its kind—two from every kind shall come to you to keep them alive. 21 And as for you, take for yourself from every kind of food that is eaten. And you must gather it to yourself. And it shall be for you and for them for food.” 22 And Noah did according to all that God commanded him; thus he did. 1 Then Yahweh said to Noah, “Go—you and all your household—into the ark, for I have seen you are righteous before me in this generation. 2 From all the clean animals you must take for yourself seven pairs, a male and its mate. And from the animals that are not clean you must take two, a male and its mate, 3 as well as from the birds of heaven seven pairs, male and female, to keep their kind alive on the face of all the earth. 4 For within seven days I will send rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights. And I will blot out all the living creatures that I have made from upon the face of the ground.” 5 And Noah did according to all that Yahweh commanded him. 6 Noah was six hundred years old when the flood waters came upon the earth. 7 And Noah and his sons and his wife, and the wives of his sons with him, went into the ark because of the waters of the flood. 8 Of clean animals, and of animals which are not clean, and of the birds, and everything that creeps upon the ground, 9 two of each went to Noah, into the ark, male and female, as God had commanded Noah. 10 And it happened that after seven days the waters of the flood came over the earth. 11 In the six hundredth year of the life of Noah, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month—on that day all the springs of the great deep were split open, and the windows of heaven were opened. 12 And the rain came upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 13 On this same day, Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and the wife of Noah and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark, 14 they and all the living creatures according to their kind, and all the domesticated animals according to their kind, and all the creatures that creep upon the earth according to their kind, all the birds according to their kind, every winged creature. 15 And they came to Noah to the ark, two of each, from every living thing in which was the breath of life. 16 And those that came, male and female, of every living thing, came as God had commanded him. And Yahweh shut the door behind him. 17 And the flood came forty days on the earth. And the waters increased, and lifted the ark, and it rose up from the earth. 18 And the waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth. And the ark went upon the surface of the waters. 19 And the waters prevailed overwhelmingly upon the earth, and they covered all the high mountains which were under the entire heaven. 20 The waters swelled fifteen cubits above the mountains, covering them. 21 And every living thing that moved on the earth perished—the birds, and the domesticated animals, and the wild animals, and everything that swarmed on the earth, and all humankind. 22 Everything in whose nostrils was the breath of life, among all that was on dry land, died. 23 And he blotted out every living thing upon the surface of the ground, from humankind, to animals, to creeping things, and to the birds of heaven; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained. 24 And the waters prevailed over the earth one hundred and fifty days.

Genesis,"23 And he blotted out every living thing upon the surface of the ground, from humankind, to animals, to creeping things, and to the birds of heaven; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained. 24 And the waters prevailed over the earth one hundred and fifty days. 1 And God remembered Noah and all the wild animals, and all the domesticated animals that were with him in the ark. And God caused a wind to blow over the earth, and the waters subsided. 2 And the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, and the rain from the heavens was restrained. 3 And the waters receded from the earth gradually, and the waters abated at the end of one hundred and fifty days. 4 And the ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat. 5 And the waters continued to recede to the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared. 6 And it happened that at the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made. 7 And he sent out a raven; it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from upon the earth. 8 And he sent out a dove to see whether the waters had subsided from upon the face of the ground. 9 But the dove did not find a resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark, for the waters were still on the face of all the earth. And he stretched out his hand and took her, and brought her to himself into the ark. 10 And he waited another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark. 11 And the dove came to him in the evening, and behold, a freshly-picked olive tree leaf was in her mouth. And Noah knew that the waters had subsided from upon the earth. 12 And he waited seven more days, and he sent out the dove. But it did not return again to him. 13 And it happened that, in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the waters dried up from upon the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked. And behold, the face of the ground was dried up. 14 And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. 15 And God spoke to Noah, saying: 16 “Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons, and your sons’ wives with you. 17 Bring out with you all the living things which are with you, from all the living creatures—birds, and animals, and everything that creeps on the earth, and let them swarm on the earth and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.” 18 So Noah went out, with his sons and his wife, and the wives of his sons with him. 19 Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, and everything that moves upon the earth, according to its families, went out from the ark. 20 And Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and he took from all the clean animals and from all the clean birds, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 21 And Yahweh smelled the soothing fragrance, and Yahweh said to himself, “Never again will I curse the ground for the sake of humankind, because the inclination of the heart of humankind is evil from his youth. Nor will I ever again destroy all life as I have done. 22 As long as the earth endures, seed and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will not cease.

Genesis,"1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. 2 And fear of you and dread of you shall be upon every animal of the earth, and on every bird of heaven, and on everything that moves upon the ground, and on all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they shall be given. 3 Every moving thing that lives shall be for you as food. As I gave the green plants to you, I now give you everything. 4 Only you shall not eat raw flesh with blood in it. 5 And your lifeblood I will require; from every animal I will require it. And from the hand of humankind, from the hand of each man to his brother I will require the life of humankind. 6 “As for the one shedding the blood of humankind, by humankind his blood shall be shed, for God made humankind in his own image. 7 “And you, be fruitful and multiply, swarm on the earth and multiply in it.” 8 And God said to Noah and to his sons with him, 9 “As for me, behold, I am establishing my covenant with you and with your seed after you, 10 and with every living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and every animal of the earth with you, from all that came out of the ark to all the animals of the earth. 11 I am establishing my covenant with you, that never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, nor will there ever be a flood that destroys the earth.” 12 And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant that I am making between me and you, and between every living creature that is with you for future generations. 13 My bow I have set in the clouds, and it shall be for a sign of the covenant between me and between the earth. 14 And when I make clouds appear over the earth the bow shall be seen in the clouds. 15 Then I will remember my covenant that is between me and you, and between every living creature, with all flesh. And the waters of a flood will never again cause the destruction of all flesh. 16 The bow shall be in the clouds, and I will see it, so as to remember the everlasting covenant between God and between every living creature, with all flesh that is upon the earth.” 17 And God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant which I am establishing between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. 18 Now the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.) 19 These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated. 20 And Noah began to be a man of the ground, and he planted a vineyard. 21 And he drank some of the wine and became drunk, and he exposed himself in the midst of his tent. 22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and he told his two brothers outside. 23 Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, and the two of them put it on their shoulders and, walking backward, they covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were turned backward, so that they did not see the nakedness of their father. 24 Then Noah awoke from his drunkenness, and he knew what his youngest son had done to him. 25 And he said, “Cursed be Canaan, a slave of slaves he shall be to his brothers.” 26 Then he said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem, and let Canaan be a slave to them. 27 May God make space for Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be a slave for him.” 28 And Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood. 29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.

Genesis,"1 These are the generations of the sons of Noah—Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Children were born to them after the flood. 2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 3 And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 4 And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 5 From these the coastland peoples spread out through their lands, each according to his own language by their own families, in their nations. 6 And the sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan. 7 And the sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 8 And Cush fathered Nimrod. He was the first on earth to be a mighty warrior. 9 He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it was said, “Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Yahweh.” 10 Now, the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 11 From that land he went out to Assyria, and he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, 12 Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city. 13 And Egypt fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 14 Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim. 15 Canaan fathered Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth, 16 and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 17 the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 18 the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad. 19 And the territory of the Canaanites was from Sidon in the direction of Gerar as far as Gaza, and in the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 20 These are the descendants of Ham, according to their families and their languages, in their lands, and in their nations. 21 And to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the older brother of Japheth, children were also born. 22 The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. 23 And the sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 24 And Arphaxad fathered Shelah, and Shelah fathered Eber. 25 And to Eber two sons were born. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided, and the name of his brother was Joktan. 26 And Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. 30 And their dwelling place extended from Mesha in the direction of Sephar to the hill country of the east. 31 These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands, and according to their nations. 32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations and in their nations. And from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood. 1 Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. 2 And as people migrated from the east they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. 3 And they said to each other, “Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone and they had tar for mortar.

Genesis,"4 And they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower whose top reaches to the heavens. And let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth.” 5 Then Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower that humankind was building. 6 And Yahweh said, “Behold, they are one people with one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. So now nothing that they intend to do will be impossible for them. 7 Come, let us go down and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand each other’s language.” 8 So Yahweh scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth, and they stopped building the city. 9 Therefore its name was called Babel, for there Yahweh confused the language of the whole earth, and there Yahweh scattered them over the face of the whole earth. 10 These are the generations of Shem. When Shem was one hundred years old, he fathered Arphaxad, two years after the flood. 11 And Shem lived five hundred years after he fathered Arphaxad, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 12 When Arphaxad had lived thirty-five years, he fathered Shelah. 13 And Arphaxad lived four hundred and three years after he fathered Shelah, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 14 When Shelah had lived thirty years, he fathered Eber. 15 And Shelah lived four hundred and three years after he fathered Eber, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 16 When Eber had lived thirty-four years, he fathered Peleg. 17 And Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after he fathered Peleg, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 18 When Peleg had lived thirty years, he fathered Reu. 19 And Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after he fathered Reu, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 20 When Reu had lived thirty-two years, he fathered Serug. 21 And Reu lived two hundred and seven years after he fathered Serug, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 22 When Serug had lived thirty years, he fathered Nahor. 23 And Serug lived two hundred years after he fathered Nahor, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 24 When Nahor had lived twenty-nine years, he fathered Terah. 25 And Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years after he fathered Terah, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 26 When Terah had lived seventy years, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 27 Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and Haran fathered Lot. 28 And Haran died in the presence of Terah his father in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 29 And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of the wife of Abram was Sarai, and the name of the wife of Nahor was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah. 30 And Sarai was barren; she had no child. 31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, the wife of Abram his son, and went out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan. And they went to Haran, and they settled there. 32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.

Genesis,"1 And Yahweh said to Abram, “Go out from your land and from your relatives, and from the house of your father, to the land that I will show you. 2 And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great. And you will be a blessing. 3 And I will bless those who bless you, and those who curse you I will curse. And all families of the earth will be blessed in you.” 4 And Abram went out as Yahweh had told him, and Lot went with him. Now Abram was seventy-five years old when he went out from Haran. 5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his nephew, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and all the persons that they had acquired in Haran, and they went out to go to the land of Canaan. And they went to the land of Canaan. 6 And Abram traveled through the land up to the place of Shechem, to the Oak of Moreh. Now the Canaanites were in the land at that time. 7 And Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” And he built an altar there to Yahweh, who had appeared to him. 8 And he moved on from there to the hill country, east of Bethel. And he pitched his tent at Bethel on the west, and at Ai on the east. And he built an altar there to Yahweh. And he called on the name of Yahweh. 9 And Abram kept moving on, toward the Negev. 10 And there was a famine in the land. And Abram went down to Egypt to dwell as an alien there, for the famine was severe in the land. 11 And it happened that as he drew near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “Look now, I know that you are a woman beautiful of appearance, 12 and it shall happen that, if the Egyptians see you, then they will say, ‘This is his wife,’ then they will kill me but let you live.

Genesis,"13 Please say you are my sister so that it will go well for me on your account. Then I will live on account of you.” 14 And it happened that as Abram came into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful. 15 And the officials of Pharaoh saw her, and they praised her beauty to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken to the house of Pharaoh. 16 And he dealt well with Abram on account of her, and he had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male slaves, female slaves, female donkeys, and camels. 17 Then Yahweh afflicted Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues on account of the matter of Sarai the wife of Abram. 18 Then Pharaoh called for Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? 19 Why did you say ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to myself as a wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go.” 20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him, and then sent him and his wife and all that was with him away. 1 Then Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that was with him. And Lot went with him to the Negev. 2 Now Abram was very wealthy in livestock, in silver, and in gold. 3 And he went according to his journey from the Negev, then to Bethel, to the place where his tent was at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 4 to the place where he had made an altar at the beginning. And Abram called on the name of Yahweh there. 5 And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. 6 And the land could not support them so as to live together, because their possessions were so many that they were not able to live together. 7 And there was a quarrel between the herdsmen of the livestock of Abram and the herdsmen of the livestock of Lot. Now at that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land. 8 Then Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there not be quarreling between me and you, and between my shepherds and your shepherds, for we men are brothers. 9 Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you want what is on the left, then I will go right; if you want what is on the right, I will go left.” 10 And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw the whole plain of the Jordan, that all of it was well-watered land—this was before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah—like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt in the direction of Zoar. 11 So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan. And Lot journeyed eastward, and so they separated from each other. 12 Abram settled in the land of Canaan, and Lot settled in the cities of the plain. And he pitched his tent toward Sodom. 13 Now the men of Sodom were extremely wicked sinners against Yahweh. 14 And Yahweh said to Abram after Lot had separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are to the north, and to the south, and to the east and to the west, 15 for all the land which you see I will give to you, and to your descendants, forever. 16 I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth which, if anyone were able to count the dust of the earth, your descendants would be so counted. 17 Arise, go through the length of the land and through its breadth, for I will give it to you.” 18 So Abram pitched his tent, and he came and settled at the oaks of Mamre, which were at Hebron. And there he built an altar to Yahweh. 1 And it happened that in the days of Amraphel, the king of Shinar, Arioch, the king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer, the king of Elam, and Tidal, the king of Goiim, 2 made war with Bera, the king of Sodom, and Birsha, the king of Gomorrah, Shinab, the king of Admah, and Shemeber, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). 3 All these joined forces at the valley of Siddim (that is, the sea of the salt). 4 Twelve years they had served Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 5 In the fourteenth year Kedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-Kiriathaim, 6 and the Horites in their hill country of Seir, as far as El-Paran, which is at the wilderness. 7 Then they turned back and came to En-Mishpat (that is, Kadesh). And they defeated the whole territory of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were living in Hazazon-Tamar. 8 Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they took up battle position in the Valley of Siddim 9 with Kedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim, and Amraphel, king of Shinar, and Arioch, king of Ellasar, four kings against five. 10 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits. And the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell into them, but the rest fled to the mountains. 11 So they took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their provisions, and they left.

Genesis,"12 And they took Lot, the son of the brother of Abram, and his possessions, and left. (Now he had been living in Sodom.) 13 Then one who escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. And he was living at the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner. They were allies with Abram. 14 When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he summoned his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen of them, and he went in pursuit up to Dan. 15 And he divided his trained men against them at night, he and his servants. And he defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, which is north of Damascus. 16 And he brought back all the possessions. And he also brought back Lot, his relative, and his possessions, and the women and the people as well. 17 After his return from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the Valley of the King). 18 And Melchizedek, the king of Salem, brought out bread and wine. (He was the priest of God Most High). 19 And he blessed him and said, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth. 20 And blessed be God Most High who delivered your enemies into your hand.” And he gave to him a tenth of everything. 21 And the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, but the possessions take for yourself.” 22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, 23 that neither a thread nor a thong of a sandal would I take from all that belongs to you, that you might not say, ‘I made Abram rich.’ 24 Nothing besides what the servants have eaten and the share of the men who went out with me will I take. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.” 1 After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision, saying: “Do not be afraid, Abram; I am your shield, and your reward shall be very great.” 2 Then Abram said, “O Yahweh, my Lord, what will you give me? I continue to be childless, and my heir is Eliezer of Damascus.” 3 And Abram said, “Look, you have not given me a descendant, and here, a member of my household is my heir.” 4 And behold, the word of Yahweh came to him saying, “This person will not be your heir, but your own son will be your heir.” 5 And he brought him outside and said, “Look toward the heavens and count the stars if you are able to count them.” And he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” 6 And he believed in Yahweh, and he reckoned it to him as righteousness.

Genesis,"6 And he believed in Yahweh, and he reckoned it to him as righteousness. 7 And he said to him, “I am Yahweh, who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give this land to you, to possess it.” 8 And he said, “O Yahweh God, how shall I know that I will possess it?” 9 And he said to him, “Take for me a three-year-old heifer, and a three-year-old female goat, and a three-year-old ram, and a turtledove and a young pigeon.” 10 And he took for him all these and cut them in pieces down the middle. And he put each piece opposite the other, but the birds he did not cut. 11 And the birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. 12 And it happened, as the sun went down, then a deep sleep fell upon Abram and, behold, a great terrifying darkness fell upon him. 13 And he said to Abram, “You must surely know that your descendants shall be as aliens in a land not their own. And they shall serve them and they shall oppress them four hundred years. 14 And also the nation that they serve I will judge. Then afterward they shall go out with great possessions. 15 And as for you, you shall go to your ancestors in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age. 16 And the fourth generation shall return here, for the guilt of the Amorites is not yet complete.” 17 And after the sun had gone down and it was dusk, behold, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch passed between those half pieces. 18 On that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram saying, “To your offspring I will give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates river, 19 the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.” 1 Now Sarai, the wife of Abram, had borne him no children. And she had an Egyptian female slave, and her name was Hagar. 2 And Sarai said to Abram, “Look, please, Yahweh has prevented me from bearing children. Please go in to my servant; perhaps I will have children by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. 3 Then Sarai, the wife of Abram, took Hagar, her Egyptian female slave, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband as his wife. 4 And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, then her mistress grew small in her eyes. 5 And Sarai said to Abram, “may my harm be upon you. I had my slave sleep with you, and when she saw that she had conceived, she no longer respected me. May Yahweh judge between me and you!” ",Genesis 15:6-16:5,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/genesis-156165-182266/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-05-11_genesis-156165_20110425171304.mp3
Genesis,"6 And Abram said to Sarai, “Look, your slave is under your authority. Do to her that which is good in your eyes.” And Sarai mistreated her, and she fled from her presence. 7 And the angel of Yahweh found her at a spring of water in the wilderness, at the spring by the road of Shur. 8 And he said to Hagar, the female slave of Sarai, “From where have you come, and where are you going?” And she said, “I am fleeing from the presence of Sarai my mistress.” 9 Then the angel of Yahweh said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit yourself under her authority.” 10 And the angel of Yahweh said to her, “I will greatly multiply your offspring, so that they cannot be counted for their abundance.” 11 And the angel of Yahweh said to her: “Behold, you are pregnant and shall have a son. And you shall call his name Ishmael, for Yahweh has listened to your suffering. 12 And he shall be a wild donkey of a man, his hand will be against everyone, and the hand of everyone will be against him, and he will live in hostility with all his brothers.” 13 So she called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her, “You are El-Roi,” for she said, “Here I have seen after he who sees me.” 14 Therefore the well was called Beer-Lahai-Roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. 15 And Hagar had a child for Abram, a son. And Abram called the name of his son whom Hagar bore to him, Ishmael. 16 And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram. 1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old Yahweh appeared to Abram. And he said to him, “I am El-Shaddai; walk before me and be blameless 2 so that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you exceedingly.” 3 Then Abram fell upon his face and God spoke with him, saying, 4 “As for me, behold, my covenant shall be with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. 5 Your name shall no longer be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I will make you the father of a multitude of nations. 6 And I will make you exceedingly fruitful. I will make you a nation, and kings shall go out from you. 7 And I will establish my covenant between me and you, and between your offspring after you, throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant to be as God for you and to your offspring after you.

Genesis,"8 And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land in which you are living as an alien, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting property. And I will be to them as God.” 9 And God said to Abraham, “Now as for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you, throughout their generations. 10 This is my covenant which you shall keep, between me and you, and also with your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. 11 And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you. 12 And at eight days of age you shall yourselves circumcise every male belonging to your generations and the servant born in your house and the one bought from any foreigner who is not from your offspring. 13 You must certainly circumcise the servant born in your house and the one bought with your money. And my covenant shall be with your flesh as an everlasting covenant. 14 And as for any uncircumcised male who has not circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant. 15 And God said to Abraham, “as for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, for Sarah shall be her name. 16 And I will bless her; moreover, I give to you from her a son. And I will bless her, and she shall give rise to nations. Kings of peoples shall come from her.” 17 And Abraham fell upon his face and laughed. And he said in his heart, “Can a child be born to a man a hundred years old, or can Sarah bear a child at ninety?” 18 And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you!” 19 And God said, “No, but Sarah your wife shall bear a son for you, and you shall call his name Isaac. And I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant to his offspring after him. 20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I will bless him and I will make him fruitful, and I will multiply him exceedingly. He shall father twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. 21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this appointed time next year.” 22 When he finished speaking with him, God went up from Abraham. 23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son and all who were born of his house, and all those acquired by his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on the same day that God spoke with him. 24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin. 25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin. 26 Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised on the same day. 27 And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those acquired by money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him. 1 And Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre. And he was sitting in the doorway of the tent at the heat of the day. 2 And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, three men were standing near him. And he saw them and ran from the doorway of the tent to meet them. And he bowed down to the ground. 3 And he said, “My lord, if I have found favor in your eyes do not pass by your servant. 4 Let a little water be brought and wash your feet, and rest under the tree. 5 And let me bring a piece of bread, then refresh yourselves. Afterward you can pass on, once you have passed by with your servant.” Then they said, “Do so as you have said.” 6 Then Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and he said, “Quickly—make three seahs of fine flour for kneading and make bread cakes!” 7 And Abraham ran to the cattle and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, and he made haste to prepare it. 8 Then he took curds and milk, and the calf which he prepared, and set it before them. And he was standing by them under the tree while they ate.

Genesis,"9 And they said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “Here, in the tent.” 10 And he said, “I will certainly return to you in the spring, and look, Sarah your wife will have a son.” Now Sarah was listening at the doorway of the tent, and which was behind him. 11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; the way of women had ceased to be for Sarah. 12 So Sarah laughed to herself saying, “After I am worn out and my husband is old, shall this pleasure be to me?” 13 Then Yahweh said to Abraham, “What is this that Sarah laughed, saying, ‘Is it indeed true that I will bear a child, now that I have grown old?’ 14 Is anything too difficult for Yahweh? At the appointed time I will return to you in the spring and Sarah shall have a son.” 15 But Sarah denied it, saying, “I did not laugh,” because she was afraid. He said, “No, but you did laugh.” 16 Then the men set out from there, and they looked down upon Sodom. And Abraham went with them to send them on their way. 17 Then Yahweh said, “Shall I conceal from Abraham what I am going to do? 18 Abraham will surely become a great and strong nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed on account of him. 19 For I have chosen him, that he will command his children and his household after him that they will keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice, so that Yahweh may bring upon Abraham that which he said to him.” 20 Then Yahweh said, “Because the outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very serious, 21 I will go down and I will see. Have they done altogether according to its cry of distress which has come to me? If not, I will know.” 22 And the men turned from there and went toward Sodom. And Abraham was still standing before Yahweh. 23 And Abraham drew near to Yahweh and said, “Will you also sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 24 If perhaps there are fifty righteous in the midst of the city, will you also sweep them away and not forgive the place on account of the fifty righteous in her midst? 25 Far be it from you to do such a thing as this, to kill the righteous with the wicked, that the righteous would be as the wicked! Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do justice?” 26 And Yahweh said, “If I find fifty righteous in Sodom, in the midst of the city, then I will forgive the whole place for their sake.” 27 Then Abraham answered and said, “Look, please, I was bold to speak to my Lord, but I am dust and ashes. 28 Perhaps the fifty righteous are lacking five—will you destroy the whole city on account of the five?” And he answered, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.” 29 And once again he spoke to him and said, “What if forty are found there?” And he answered, “I will not do it on account of the forty.” 30 And he said, “Please, let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if thirty be found there?” And he answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.” 31 And he said, “Please, now, I was bold to speak to my Lord. What if twenty be found there?” And he answered, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty.” 32 And he said, “Please, let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak only once more. What if ten are found there?” And he answered, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.” 33 Then Yahweh left, as he finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place. 1 And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening. And Lot was sitting in the gateway of Sodom. Then Lot saw them and stood up to meet them. And he bowed down with his face to the ground. 2 And he said, “Behold, my lords, please turn aside into the house of your servant and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you can rise early and go on your way.” And they said, “No, but we will spend the night in the square.” 3 But he urged them strongly, and they turned aside with him and came into his house. And he made a meal for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 4 Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house. 5 And they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may know them.” ",Genesis 18:9-19:5,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/genesis-189195-182269/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-05-16_genesis-189195_20110425171658.mp3
Genesis,"6 But Lot went out to them at the entrance, and he shut the door behind him. 7 And he said, “No, my brothers, please do not do such a wrong thing. 8 Behold, I have two daughters who have not known a man. Please, let me bring them out to you; then do to them as it seems good in your eyes. Only to these men do not do this thing, since they came under my roof for protection.” 9 But they said, “Step aside!” Then they said, “This fellow came to dwell as a foreigner and he acts as a judge! Now we shall do worse to you than them!” And they pressed very hard against the man, against Lot, and they drew near to break the door. 10 Then the men reached out with their hands and brought Lot in to them, into the house, and they shut the door. 11 And the men who were at the entrance of the house they struck with blindness, both small and great, and they were unable to find the entrance. 12 Then the men said to Lot, “Who is here with you? Bring out from the place your sons-in-law, and your sons and your daughters, and all who are with you in the city. 13 For we are about to destroy this place, because their cry has become great before Yahweh. Yahweh sent us to destroy it.” 14 Then Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law who were taking his daughters and said, “Get up! Go out from this place, because Yahweh is going to destroy the city!” But it seemed like a joke in the eyes of his sons-in-law. 15 And as the dawn came up the angels urged Lot saying, “Get up, take your wife and your two daughters who are staying with you, lest you be destroyed with the punishment of the city.” 16 But when he lingered, the men seized him by his hand and his wife’s hand, and his two daughters by hand, on account of the mercy of Yahweh upon him. And they brought him out and set him outside of the city. 17 And after bringing them outside one said, “Flee for your life; do not look behind you, and do not stand anywhere in the plain. Flee to the mountains lest you be destroyed.” 18 And Lot said to them, “No, please, my lords. 19 Behold, your servant has found favor in your eyes and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot flee to the mountains, lest the disaster overtake me and I die. 20 Behold, this city is near enough to flee there, and it is a little one. Please, let me flee there. Is it not a little one? Then my life shall be saved.” 21 And he said to him, “Behold, I will grant this favor as well; that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. 22 Escape there quickly, for I cannot do this thing until you get there.” Therefore, there name of the city was called Zoar. 23 After the sun had risen upon the earth and Lot had entered Zoar, 24 Yahweh rained down from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh. 25 And he overthrew those cities and the whole plain, and the inhabitants of the cities and the vegetation of the ground. 26 But his wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. 27 And Abraham arose early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before Yahweh. 28 And he looked down upon the surface of Sodom and Gomorrah, and upon the whole surface of the land, the plain. And he saw that, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a smelting furnace. 29 So it was, when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out from the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived. 30 And Lot went out from Zoar and settled in the hill country with his two daughters, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. So he lived in a cave, he and his two daughters. 31 And the firstborn daughter said to the younger one, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to come in to us according to the manner of all the land. 32 Come, let us give our father wine to drink and let us lie with him that we may secure descendants through our father.” 33 And they gave their father wine to drink that night, and the firstborn went and lay with her father, but he did not know when she lay down or when she got up. 34 And it happened that, the next day the firstborn said to the younger one, “Look, I laid with my father last night. Let us give him wine to drink also tonight, then go and lie with him that we may secure descendants through our father.” 35 And they gave their father wine to drink again that night, and the younger got up and lay with him, but he did not know when she lay down or when she got up. 36 And the two daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. 37 The firstborn gave birth to a son, and she called his name Moab. He is the father of Moab until this day. 38 And the younger, she also gave birth to a son, and she called his name Ben-Ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites until this day. 1 And Abraham journeyed from there to the land of the Negev, and he settled between Kadesh and Shur. And he dwelled as an alien in Gerar. 2 And Abraham said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. 3 And God came to Abimelech in a dream at night. And he said to him, “Look, you are a dead man on account of the woman you have taken. For she is a married woman.” 4 Now Abimelech had not approached her, so he said, “my Lord, will you even kill a righteous people?” 5 Did not he himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ With integrity of my heart and with cleanness of my hands I did this.” 6 Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you did this, and I also kept you from sinning against me. Therefore, I did not allow you to touch her. 7 So now, return the wife of the man, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you and you will live. And if you do not return her, know that you will certainly die, and all that are yours.” 8 So Abimelech rose early in the morning. And he called all his servants and told them all these things, and the men were very afraid. 9 And Abimelech called for Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you that you brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? You have done things to me that should not be done.” 10 And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What were you thinking that you did this thing?” 11 And Abraham said, “Because I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place; they will kill me on account of the matter of my wife. 12 Besides, she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother. And she became my wife. 13 And it happened that as God caused me to wander from the house of my father I said to her, ‘This is your loyal kindness that you must do for me at every place where we come: say concerning me, “He is my brother.” ’ ” 14 And Abimelech took sheep and cattle and male slaves and female slaves, and he gave them to Abraham. And he returned Sarah his wife to him. 15 And Abimelech said, “Here is my land before you; settle where it pleases you.” 16 And to Sarah he said, “Look, I have given a thousand pieces of silver to your brother. It shall be an exoneration. You are vindicated before all who are with you.” 17 And Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his female servants so that they could bear children again. 18 For Yahweh had completely closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of the matter of Sarah, the wife of Abraham.

Genesis,"1 And Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said. And Yahweh did to Sarah as he had promised. 2 And she conceived, and Sarah bore to Abraham a son in his old age at the appointed time that God had told him. 3 And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. 4 And Abraham circumcised Isaac his son when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. 5 And Abraham was one hundred years old when Isaac his son was born to him. 6 And Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; all who hear will laugh for me.” 7 And she said, “Who would announce to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne a son to Abraham in his old age.” 8 And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned. 9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne Abraham, mocking. 10 Then she said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave woman will not be heir with my son, with Isaac.” 11 And the matter displeased Abraham very much on account of his son. 12 Then God said to Abraham, “Do not be displeased on account of the boy and on account of the slave woman. Listen to everything that Sarah said to you, for through Isaac your offspring will be named. 13 And I will also make the son of the slave woman into a nation, for he is your offspring.” 14 Then Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder. And he sent her away with the child, and she went, wandering about in the wilderness, in Beersheba. 15 And when the water was finished from the skin, she put the child under one of the bushes. 16 And she went and she sat opposite him, at a distance, a bowshot away, for she said, “Let me not see the child’s death.” So she sat away from him and lifted up her voice and wept. 17 And God heard the cry of the boy and the angel of God called to Hagar from the heavens and said to her, “What is the matter Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the cry of the boy from where he is. 18 Get up, take up the boy and take him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.” 19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave a drink to the boy. 20 And God was with the boy, and he grew and lived in the wilderness. And he became an expert with a bow. 21 And he lived in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt. 22 And it happened that at that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, “God is with you, in all that you do. 23 So now, swear to me here by God that you will not deal with me falsely, or with my descendants, or my posterity. According to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall pledge to do with me and with the land where you have dwelled as an alien.” 24 And Abraham said, “I swear.” 25 Then Abraham complained to Abimelech on account of the well of water that servants of Abimelech had seized. 26 And Abimelech said, “I do not know who did this thing, neither did you tell me, nor have I heard of it except for today.” 27 And Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech. And the two of them made a covenant. 28 Then Abraham set off seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves. 29 And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe-lambs that you have set off by themselves?” 30 And he said, “You shall take the seven ewe-lambs from my hand as proof on my behalf that I dug this well.” 31 Therefore that place is called Beersheba, because there the two of them swore an oath. 32 And they made a covenant at Beersheba. And Abimelech, and Phicol his army commander stood and returned to the land of the Philistines. 33 And he planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of Yahweh, the everlasting God. 34 And Abraham dwelled as an alien in the land of the Philistines many days.

Genesis,"1 And it happened that after these things, God tested Abraham. And he said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 2 And he said, “Take your son, your only child, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains where I will tell you.” 3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his donkey. And he took two of his servants with him, and Isaac his son. And he chopped wood for a burnt offering. And he got up and went to the place which God had told him. 4 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and he saw the place at a distance. 5 And Abraham said to his servants, “You stay here with the donkey, and I and the boy will go up there. We will worship, then we will return to you.” 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and placed it on Isaac his son. And he took the fire in his hand and the knife, and the two of them went together. 7 And Isaac said to Abraham his father, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” 8 And Abraham said, “God will provide the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went together. 9 And they came to the place that God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood. Then he bound Isaac his son and placed him on the altar atop the wood. 10 And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. 11 And the angel of Yahweh called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham! Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 12 And he said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the boy; do not do anything to him. For now I know that you are one who fears God, since you have not withheld your son, your only child, from me.” 13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked. And behold, a ram was caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. 14 And Abraham called the name of that place “Yahweh will provide,” for which reason it is said today, “on the mountain of Yahweh it shall be provided.” 15 And the angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time from heaven. 16 And he said, “I swear by myself, declares Yahweh, that because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only child, 17 that I will certainly bless you and greatly multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the shore of the sea. And your offspring will take possession of the gate of his enemies. 18 All the nations of the earth will be blessed through your offspring, because you have listened to my voice.” ",Genesis 22:1-18,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/genesis-221-18-182272/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-05-19_genesis-221-18_20110425171905.mp3
Genesis,"18 All the nations of the earth will be blessed through your offspring, because you have listened to my voice.” 19 And Abraham returned to his servants, and they got up and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived in Beersheba. 20 And it happened that after these things, it was told to Abraham, “Look, Milcah has also borne children to your brother Nahor: 21 Uz his firstborn and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, 22 and Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” 23 (Now, Bethuel fathered Rebekah). These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, the brother of Abraham. 24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah. 1 And Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah. 2 And Sarah died in Kiriath Arba; that is Hebron, in the land of Canaan. And Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. 3 And Abraham rose up from his dead, and he spoke to the Hittites and said, 4 “I am a stranger and an alien among you; give to me my own burial site among you so that I may bury my dead from before me.” 5 And the Hittites answered Abraham and said to him, 6 “Hear us, my lord, you are a mighty prince in our midst. Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial sites. None of us will withhold his burial site from you for burying your dead.” 7 And Abraham rose up and bowed to the people of the land, to the Hittites. 8 And he spoke with them, saying, “If you are willing that I bury my dead from before me, hear me and intercede for me with Ephron the son of Zohar, 9 that he may sell to me the cave of Machpelah which belongs to him, which is at the end of his field. At full value let him sell it to me in your midst as a burial site.” 10 Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites with respect to all who were entering the gate of his city, and said, 11 “No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field and the cave which is in it, I also give it to you in the sight of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.” 12 And Abraham bowed before the people of the land. 13 And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, “If only you will hear me—I give the price of the field. Take it from me that I may bury my dead there.” 14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, 15 “My lord, hear me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver—what is that between me and you? Bury your dead.” 16 Then Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver at the merchants’ current rate. 17 So the field of Ephron which was in the Machpelah, which was near Mamre—the field and the cave which was in it, with all the trees that were in the field, which were within all its surrounding boundaries—passed 18 to Abraham as a property in the presence of the Hittites, with respect to all who were entering the gate of his city. 19 And thus afterward Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah near Mamre; that is Hebron, in the land of Canaan. 20 And the field and the cave which was in it passed to Abraham as a burial site from the Hittites.

Genesis,"1 Now Abraham was old, advanced in age, and Yahweh had blessed Abraham in everything. 2 And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who had charge of all he had, “Please put your hand under my thigh 3 that I may make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose midst I am dwelling, 4 but that you will go to my land and to my family, and take a wife for my son, for Isaac.” 5 And the servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land—must I then return your son to the land from whence you came?” 6 Abraham said to him, “You must take care that you do not return my son there. 7 Yahweh, the God of heaven who took me from the house of my father and from the land of my family, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, ‘to your offspring I will give this land,’ he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. 8 And if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you shall be released from this oath of mine—only you must not return my son there.” 9 Then the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and he swore to him concerning this matter. 10 And the servant took ten camels from his master’s camels, and he went with all kinds of his master’s good things in his hand. And he arose and went to Aram-Naharaim, to the city of Nahor. 11 And he made the camels kneel outside the city at the well of water, at the time of evening, toward the time the women went out to draw water.12 And he said, “O Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show loyal love to my master Abraham. 13 Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are going out to draw water. 14 And let it be that the girl to whom I shall say, ‘Please, offer your jar that I may drink’ and who says, ‘Drink—and I will also water your camels,’ she is the one you have chosen for your servant, for Isaac. By her I will know that you have shown loyal love to my master.” 15 And it happened that before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah—who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, the brother of Abraham—came out, and her jar was on her shoulder. 16 Now the girl was very pleasing in appearance. She was a virgin; no man had known her. And she went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up. 17 And the servant ran to meet her. And he said, “Please, let me drink a little of the water from your jar.” 18 And she said, “Drink, my lord.” And she quickly lowered her jar in her hand and gave him a drink. 19 When she finished giving him a drink she said, “I will also draw water for your camels until they finish drinking.” 20 And she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water. And she drew water for all his camels. 21 And the man was gazing at her silently to know if Yahweh had made his journey successful or not. 22 And it happened that as the camels finished drinking the man took a gold ring of a half shekel in weight and two bracelets for her arms, ten shekels in weight, 23 and said, “Please tell me, whose daughter are you? Is there a place at the house of your father for us to spend the night?” 24 And she said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” 25 Then she said to him, “We have both straw and fodder in abundance, as well as a place to spend the night.” 26 And the man knelt down and worshiped Yahweh. 27 And he said, “Blessed be Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld his loyal love and his faithfulness from my master. I was on the way and Yahweh led me to the house of my master’s brother.” 28 Then the girl ran and reported these things to the household of her mother. 29 Now Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. And Laban ran out to the man toward the spring. 30 And when he saw the ring and the bracelets on the arms of his sister and heard the words of Rebekah his sister, who said, “Thus the man spoke to me,” he went to the man. And behold, he was standing with the camels at the spring. 31 And he said, “Come, O blessed one of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? Now I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.” 32 And the man came to the house and unloaded the camels. And he gave straw and fodder to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.

Genesis,"33 And food was placed before him to eat. And he said, “I will not eat until I have told my errand.” And he said, “Speak.” 34 And he said, “I am the servant of Abraham. 35 Now Yahweh has blessed my master exceedingly, and he has become great. He has given to him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male slaves and female slaves, and camels and donkeys. 36 And Sarah, the wife of my master, has borne a son to my master after her old age. And he has given to him all that he has. 37 And my master made me swear, saying, ‘Do not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I am living. 38 But you shall go to the house of my father, and to my family, and you shall take a wife for my son.’ 39 And I said to my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow me.’ 40 And he said to me, ‘Yahweh, before whom I have walked, shall send his angel with you and will make your journey successful. And you shall take a wife for my son from my family, and from the house of my father. 41 Then you shall be released from my oath, when you come to my family. And if they will not give a woman to you, then you will be released from my oath.’ 42 Then today I came to the spring, and I said, ‘O Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, if you would please make my journey successful, upon which I am going. 43 Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let it be that the young woman who comes out to draw water and to whom I say, “Please give me a little water to drink from your jar,” 44 let her say to me, “Drink; I will also draw water for your camels,” she is the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for the son of my master.’ 45 I had not yet finished speaking to myself when, behold, Rebekah was coming out with her jar on her shoulder. And she went down to the spring and drew water. And I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’ 46 And she hastened and let down her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will give a drink to your camels also.’ Then I drank and she gave a drink to the camels also. 47 Then I asked her and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ And I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms. 48 And I knelt down and worshiped Yahweh, and I praised Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who led me on the right way, to take the daughter of the brother of my master for his son. 49 So now, if you are going to deal loyally and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me, so that I may turn to the right or to the left.” 50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered, and they said, “The matter has gone out from Yahweh; we are not able to speak bad or good to you. 51 Here is Rebekah before you. Take her and go; let her be a wife for the son of your master as Yahweh has spoken.” 52 And it happened that when the servant of Abraham heard their words he bowed down to the ground to Yahweh. 53 And the servant brought out silver jewelry and gold jewelry, and garments, and he gave them to Rebekah. And he gave precious gifts to her brother and to her mother. 54 And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night. And they got up in the morning, and he said, “Let me go to my master.” 55 And her brother and her mother said, “Let the girl remain with us ten days or so; after that she may go.” 56 And he said to them, “Do not delay me. Now, Yahweh has made my journey successful. Let me go. I must go to my master.” 57 And they said, “Let us call the girl and ask her opinion.” 58 And they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.” 59 So they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and the servant of Abraham and his men. 60 And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “You are our sister; may you become countless thousands; and may your offspring take possession of the gate of his enemies.” 61 And Rebekah and her maidservants arose, and they mounted the camels and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah and left. 62 Now Isaac was coming from the direction of Beer-Lahai-Roi. And he was living in the land of the Negev. 63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field early in the evening, and he lifted up his eyes and saw—behold, camels were coming. 64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac. And she got down from the camel. 65 And she said to the servant, “Who is this man walking around in the field to meet us?” And the servant said, “That is my master.” And she took her veil and covered herself. 66 And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. 67 And Isaac brought her to the tent of Sarah his mother. And he took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And Isaac loved her and was comforted after the death of his mother.

Genesis,"1 Now Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Keturah. 2 And she bore to him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 3 And Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim. 4 And the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All of these were the children of Keturah. 5 And Abraham gave all he had to Isaac. 6 But to the sons of Abraham’s concubines Abraham gave gifts. And while he was still living he sent them away eastward, away from his son Isaac, to the land of the east. 7 Now these are the days of the years of the life of Abraham: one hundred and seventy-five years. 8 And Abraham passed away and died in a good old age, old and full of years. And he was gathered to his people. 9 And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, son of Zohar the Hittite, that was east of Mamre, 10 the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried and Sarah his wife. 11 And it happened that after the death of Abraham God blessed Isaac his son, and Isaac settled at Beer-Lahai-Roi. 12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, that Hagar the Egyptian, the female slave of Sarah, bore to Abraham. 13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names according to their family records. The firstborn of Ishmael was Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their villages and by their encampments—12 leaders according to their tribes. 17 Now these are the years of the life of Ishmael: 137 years. And he passed away and died, and was gathered to his people.18 They settled from Havilah to Shur, which was opposite Egypt, going toward Assyria; he settled opposite all his brothers. 19 Now these are the generations of Isaac, the son of Abraham. Abraham fathered Isaac, 20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-Aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, as his wife. 21 And Isaac prayed to Yahweh on behalf of his wife, for she was barren. And Yahweh responded to his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 22 And the children in her womb jostled each other, and she said, “If it is going to be like this, why be pregnant?” And she went to inquire of Yahweh. 23 And Yahweh said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from birth shall be divided. And one people shall be stronger than the other. And the elder shall serve the younger.” 24 And when her days to give birth were completed, then—behold—twins were in her womb. 25 And the first came out red, all his body was like a hairy coat, so they called his name Esau. 26 And afterward his brother came out, and his hand grasped the heel of Esau, so his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old at their birth. 27 And the boys grew up. And Esau was a skilled hunter, a man of the field, but Jacob was a peaceful man, living in tents. 28 And Isaac loved Esau because he could eat of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob. 29 Once Jacob cooked a thick stew, and Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted. 30 And Esau said to Jacob, “Give me some of that red stuff to gulp down, for I am exhausted!” (Therefore his name was called Edom). 31 Then Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright first.” 32 And Esau said, “Look, I am going to die; now what is this birthright to me?” 33 Then Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” And he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob. 34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread, and thick lentil stew, and he ate and drank. Then he got up and went away. So Esau despised his birthright.

Genesis,"1 And there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine which was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, to Gerar. 2 And Yahweh appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land which I will show to you. 3 Dwell as an alien in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you, for I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your father. 4 And I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and I will give to your descendants all these lands. And all nations of the earth will be blessed through your offspring, 5 because Abraham listened to my voice and kept my charge: my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.” 6 So Isaac settled in Gerar. 7 When the men of the place asked concerning his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “my wife,” thinking “the men of the place will kill me on account of Rebekah, for she was beautiful.” 8 And it happened that, when he had been there a long time, Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked through the window, and saw—behold—Isaac was fondling Rebekah his wife. 9 And Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Surely she is your wife. Now why did you say ‘She is my sister’?” And Isaac said to him, “Because I thought I would die on account of her.” 10 And Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have slept with your wife! Then you would have brought guilt upon us!” 11 Then Abimelech instructed all the people, saying, “The one who touches this man or his wife shall certainly die.” 12 And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in that same year a hundredfold, and Yahweh blessed him. 13 And the man became wealthier and wealthier until he was exceedingly wealthy. 14 And he possessed sheep and cattle and many servants, so that the Philistines envied him. 15 And the Philistines stopped up all the wells that the servants of his father had dug in the days of Abraham his father. They filled them with earth. 16 And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you have become much too powerful for us.” 17 So Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar, and settled there. 18 And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after the death of Abraham. And he gave to them the same names which his father had given them. 19 And when the servants of Isaac dug in the valley, they found a well of fresh water there. 20 Then the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying, “The water is ours.” And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. 21 And they dug another well, and they quarreled over it also. And he called its name Sitnah. 22 Then he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. And he called its name Rehoboth, and said, “Now Yahweh has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.” 23 And from there he went up to Beersheba. 24 And Yahweh appeared to him that night and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you, and I will bless you and make your descendants numerous for the sake of my servant Abraham.” 25 And he built an altar there and called on the name of Yahweh. And he pitched his tent there, and the servants of Isaac dug a well there. 26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol his army commander. 27 And Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me? You hate me and sent me away from you.” 28 And they said, “We see clearly that Yahweh has been with you, so we thought let there be an oath between us—between us and you—and let us make a covenant with you 29 that you may not do us harm just as we have not touched you, but have only done good to you and sent you away in peace. You are now blessed by Yahweh.” 30 So he made a meal for them, and they ate and drank. 31 And they arose early in the morning and each one swore to the other, and Isaac sent them away. And they left him in peace. 32 And it happened that on that same day the servants of Isaac came and told him about the well that they had dug. And they said, “We have found water!” 33 And he called it Sheba. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. 34 And when Esau was forty years old he took as wife Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite. 35 And they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah.

Genesis,"1 And it happened that when Isaac was old and his eyesight was weak, he called Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.” And he said to him, “Here I am.” 2 And he said, “Look, I am old; I do not know the day of my death. 3 So now, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt food for me. 4 Then make for me tasty food like I love, and bring it to me. And I will eat it so that I can bless you before I die. 5 Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to Esau his son, and when Esau went to the field to hunt wild game to bring back, 6 Rebekah said to Jacob her son, “Look, I heard your father speaking to Esau your brother saying, 7 ‘Bring wild game to me and prepare tasty food so I can eat it and bless you before Yahweh before my death.’ 8 So now, my son, listen to my voice, to what I command you. 9 Go to the flock and take two good young goats from it for me, and I will prepare them as tasty food for your father, just as he likes. 10 Then you must take it to your father and he will eat it so that he may bless you before his death.” 11 Then Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, but I am a smooth man. 12 Perhaps my father will feel me and I will be in his eyes as a mocker, and he will bring upon me a curse and not a blessing.” 13 Then his mother said to him, “Your curse be upon me, my son, only listen to my voice—go and get them for me.” 14 So he went and took them, and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared tasty food as his father liked. 15 Then Rebekah took some of her older son Esau’s best garments that were with her in the house, and she put them on Jacob her younger son. 16 And she put the skins of the young goats over his hands and over the smooth part of his neck.17 And she put the tasty food and the bread that she had made into the hand of Jacob, her son. 18 And he went to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?” 19 And Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please get up, sit up and eat from my wild game so that you may bless me.” 20 Then Isaac said to his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because Yahweh your God caused me to find it.” 21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please, come near and let me feel you, my son. Are you really my son Esau or not?” 22 And Jacob drew near to Isaac his father. And he felt him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” 23 And he did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like the hands of Esau his brother. And he blessed him. 24 And he said, “Are you really my son Esau?” And he said, “I am.” 25 Then he said, “Bring it near to me that I may eat from the game of my son, so that I may bless you.” And he brought it to him, and he ate. And he brought wine to him, and he drank. 26 Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near and kiss me, my son.” 27 And he drew near and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his garments, and he blessed him and said, “Look, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that Yahweh has blessed! 28 May God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of grain and new wine. 29 Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you; Be lord of your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. Cursed be those cursing you, and blessed be those blessing you.” 30 And as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, immediately after Jacob had gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came back from his hunting. 31 He too prepared tasty food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat from the wild game of his son, that you may bless me.” 32 And Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.” 33 Then Isaac trembled violently. Then he said, “Who then was he that hunted wild game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I blessed him? Moreover, he will be blessed!” 34 When Esau heard the words of his father he cried out with a great and exceedingly bitter cry of distress. And he said to his father, “Bless me as well, my father!” 35 And he said, “Your brother came in deceit and took your blessing.” 36 Then he said, “Isn’t that why he is named Jacob? He has deceived me these two times. He took my birthright and, look, now he has taken my blessing!” Then he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?” 37 Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, “Behold, I have made him lord over you and I have given him all his brothers as servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. Now what can I do for you, my son?” 38 And Esau said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me also, my father!” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept. 39 Then Isaac his father answered and said to him, “Your home shall be from the fatness of the land, and from the dew of heaven above. 40 But by your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother. But it shall be that when free yourself you shall tear off his yoke from your neck. 41 Then Esau held a grudge against Jacob on account of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are coming, then I will kill Jacob my brother.” 42 But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called for her younger son Jacob. And she said to him, “Look, Esau your brother is consoling himself concerning you, intending to kill you. 43 Now then, my son, listen to my voice; arise and flee to Haran to Laban my brother. 44 Stay with him a few days until the wrath of your brother has turned—45 until the anger of your brother turns from you and he has forgotten what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I lose the two of you in one day?” 46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I loathe my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from Hittite women like these, from the native women, what am I living for?” ",Genesis 27,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/genesis-27-187362/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-05-27_genesis-27_20110517141514.mp3
Genesis,"1 Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him. And he instructed him and said to him, “You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. 2 Arise, go to Paddan-Aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father, and take for yourself a wife from there, from the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother. 3 Now, may El-Shaddai bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, so that you become an assembly of peoples. 4 And may he give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your descendants with you, that you may take possession of the land of your sojourning, which God gave to Abraham.” 5 Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau. 6 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-Aram, to take for himself a wife from there, and he blessed him and instructed him, saying, “You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,” 7 and that Jacob listened to his father and to his mother and went to Paddan-Aram. 8 Then Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father, 9 then Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, son of Abraham, sister of Nebaioth, as a wife, in addition to the wives he had. 10 Then Jacob went out from Beersheba and went to Haran. 11 And he arrived at a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head and slept at that place. 12 And he dreamed, and behold, a stairway was set on the earth, and its top touched the heavens. And behold, angels of God were going up and going down on it. 13 And behold, Yahweh was standing beside him, and he said, “I am Yahweh, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. The ground on which you were sleeping I will give to you and to your descendants. 14 Your descendants shall be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west, and to the east, and to the north and to the south. And all the families of the earth will be blessed through you and through your descendants. 15 Now behold, I am with you, and I will keep you wherever you go. And I will bring you to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised to you.” 16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely Yahweh is indeed in this place and I did not know!” 17 Then he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is nothing else than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven!” 18 And Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up as a stone pillar, and poured oil on top of it. 19 And he called the name of that place Bethel; however, the name of the city was formerly Luz. 20 And Jacob made a vow saying, “If God will be with me and protect me on this way that I am going, and gives me food to eat and clothing to wear, 21 and if I return in peace to the house of my father, then Yahweh will become my God. 22 And this stone that I have set up as a pillar shall be the house of God, and of all that you give to me I will certainly give a tenth to you.” ",Genesis 28,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/genesis-28-187363/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-05-30_genesis-28_20110517141658.mp3
Genesis,"1 And Jacob continued his journey and went to the land of the Easterners. 2 And he looked, and behold, there was a well in the field, and behold, there were three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of that well the flocks were watered. And the stone on the mouth of the well was large. 3 And when all the flocks were gathered there, they rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well. And they watered the sheep and returned the stone upon the mouth of the well to its place. 4 And Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Haran.” 5 And he said to them, “Do you know Laban, son of Nahor?” And they said, “We know him.” 6 And he said to them, “Is he well?” And they said, “He is well. Now look, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep.” 7 And he said, “Look, it is still broad daylight; it is not the time for the livestock to be gathered. Give water to the sheep and go, pasture them.” 8 And they said, “We are not able, until all the flocks are gathered. Then the stone is rolled away from the mouth of the well, and we water the sheep.” 9 While he was speaking with them, Rachel came with the sheep which belonged to her father, for she was pasturing them. 10 And it happened that, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob drew near and rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother. 11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept. 12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was the relative of her father, and that he was the son of Rebekah. And she ran and told her father.13 And it happened that when Laban heard the message about Jacob, the son of his sister, he ran to meet him. And he embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. 14 And Laban said to him, “Surely you are my flesh and my bone!” And he stayed with him a month. 15 Then Laban said to Jacob, “Just because you are my brother should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wage should be.” 16 Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 17 Now the eyes of Leah were dull, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. 18 And Jacob loved Rachel and said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.” 19 Then Laban said, “Better that I give her to you than I give her to another man. Stay with me.” 20 And Jacob worked for Rachel seven years, but they were as a few days in his eyes because he loved her. 21 And Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.” 22 So Laban gathered all the men of the place and prepared a feast. 23 And it happened that in the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him, and he went in to her. 24 And Laban gave Zilpah his female slave to her, to Leah his daughter as a female servant. 25 And it happened that in the morning, behold, it was Leah! And he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Now why did you deceive me?” 26 Then Laban said, “It is not the custom in our country to give the younger before the firstborn. 27 Complete the week of this one, then I will also give you the other, on the condition that you will work for me another seven years.” 28 And Jacob did so. So he completed the week of this one, then he gave Rachel his daughter to him as a wife. 29 And Laban gave Bilhah his female slave to Rachel his daughter as a female servant. 30 Then he also went in to Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served with him yet another seven years.

Genesis,"30 Then he also went in to Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served with him yet another seven years. 31 When Yahweh saw that Leah was unloved he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. 32 Then Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, “Because Yahweh has noticed my misery. Surely now my husband will love me.” 33 And she conceived again and gave birth to a son. And she said, “It is because Yahweh has heard that I am unloved that he gave me this son also.” And she called his name Simeon. 34 And she conceived again and gave birth to a son. Then she said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, for I have borne him three sons.” Therefore, she called his name Levi. 35 And she conceived again and gave birth to a son. And she said, “This time I will praise Yahweh.” Therefore she called his name Judah. And she ceased bearing children. 1 When Rachel saw that she could not bear children to Jacob, Rachel envied her sister. And she said to Jacob, “Give me children—if not, I will die!” 2 And Jacob became angry with Rachel. And he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?” 3 Then she said, “Here is my servant girl Bilhah; go in to her that she may bear children as my surrogate. Then I will even have children by her.” 4 Then she gave him Bilhah, her female slave, as a wife, and Jacob went in to her 5 And Bilhah conceived and gave birth to a son for Jacob. 6 Then Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son.” Therefore she called his name Dan. 7 And Bilhah, Rachel’s female slave, conceived again and bore a second son to Jacob. 8 And Rachel said, “I have struggled a mighty struggle with my sister and have prevailed.” And she called his name Naphtali. 9 When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took Zilpah her female slave and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 10 And Zilpah, the female slave of Leah, bore a son to Jacob. 11 Then Leah said, “Good fortune!” And she called his name Gad. 12 And Zilpah, Leah’s female slave, bore a second son to Jacob. 13 Then Leah said, “How happy am I! For women have called me happy.” So she called his name Asher. 14 And in the days of the wheat harvest, Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and he brought them to Leah his mother. And Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” 15 And she said to her, “Is your taking my husband such a small thing that you will also take the mandrakes of my son?” Then Rachel said, “Then he may sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.” 16 When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him. And she said, “Come in to me, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” And he slept with her that night. 17 And God listened to Leah and she conceived and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob. 18 Then Leah said, “God has given me my wage since I gave my slave girl to my husband.” And she called his name Issachar. 19 And Leah conceived again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob. 20 And Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good gift. This time my husband will acknowledge me, because I bore him six sons.” And she called his name Zebulun. 21 And afterward she gave birth to a daughter. And she called her name Dinah. 22 Then God remembered Rachel and listened to her, and God opened her womb. 23 And she conceived and gave birth to a son. And she said, “God has taken away my disgrace.” 24 And she called his name Joseph, saying, “Yahweh has added to me another son.” 25 And it happened that as soon as Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away that I may go to my place and my land. 26 Give me my wives and my children for which I have served you, and let me go. For you yourself know my service that I have rendered to you.” 27 But Laban said to him, “Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, I have learned by divination that Yahweh has blessed me because of you.” 28 And he said, “Name your wage to me and I will give it.” 29 Then he said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you and how your livestock have been with me. 30 For you had little before me, and it has increased abundantly. And Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned. So then, when shall I provide for my own family also?” 31 And he said, “What shall I give you?” And Jacob said, “Do not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flocks and keep them. 32 Let me pass through all your flocks today, removing all the speckled and spotted sheep from them, along with every dark-colored sheep among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. That shall be my wages. 33 And my righteousness will answer for me later when you come concerning my wages before you. Every one that is not speckled or spotted among the goats, or dark-colored among the sheep shall be stolen if it is with me.” 34 Then Laban said, “Look! Very well. It shall be according to your word.” 35 But that day he removed the streaked and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats, all that had white on it, and every dark-colored ram, and put them in the charge of his sons. 36 And he put a journey of three days between him and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the remainder of Laban’s flock. 37 Then Jacob took fresh branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled white strips on them, exposing the white which was on the branches. 38 And he set the branches that he had peeled in front of the flocks, in the troughs that were in the water containers, where the flocks came to drink. And they were in heat when they came to drink. 39 And the flocks mated by the branches, so the flocks bore streaked, speckled, and spotted. 40 And Jacob separated the lambs and turned the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the dark-colored in Laban’s flocks. And he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with the flocks of Laban. 41 And whenever any of the stronger of the flocks were in heat, Jacob put the branches in full view of the flock in the troughs that they might mate among the branches. 42 But with the more feeble of the flock he would not put them there. So the feebler were Laban’s and the stronger were Jacob’s. 43 And the man became exceedingly rich and had large flocks, female slaves, male slaves, camels, and donkeys. 1 Now he heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying, “Jacob has taken all that our father has,” and “From that which was our father’s he has gained all this wealth.” 2 Then Jacob saw the face of Laban and, behold, it was not like it had been in the past. 3 And Yahweh said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your ancestors and to your family, and I will be with you.” 4 So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flocks, 5 and he said to them, “Look, I see the face of your father, that it is not like it has been toward me in the past. But the God of my father is with me. 6 Now you yourselves know that I have served your father with all my strength, 7 and your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God has not allowed him to harm me.

Genesis,"7 and your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God has not allowed him to harm me. 8 If thus he said, ‘Speckled shall be your wage,’ then all the flock bore speckled. And if he said, ‘Streaked shall be your wage,’ then all the flock bore streaked. 9 God has taken away your father’s livestock and given them to me. 10 Now it happened that at the time of the mating of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams mounting the flock were streaked, speckled, and dappled. 11 Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’ 12 And he said, ‘Lift up your eyes and see—all the rams mounting the flock are streaked, speckled, and dappled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you. 13 I am the God of Bethel where you anointed a stone pillar, where you made a vow to me. Now get up, go out from this land and return to the land of your birth.’ ” 14 Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, “Is there yet a portion for us, and an inheritance in the house of our father? 15 Are we not regarded as foreigners by him, because he has sold us and completely consumed our money? 16 For all the wealth that God has taken away from our father, it belongs to us and to our sons. So now, all that God has said to you, do.” 17 Then Jacob got up and put his children and his wives on the camels. 18 And he drove all his livestock and his possessions that he had acquired, the livestock of his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-Aram, in order to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan. 19 Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole the idols that belonged to her father. 20 And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he intended to flee. 21 Then he fled with all that he had, and arose and crossed the Euphrates and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead. 22 And on the third day it was told to Laban that Jacob had fled. 23 Then he took his kinsmen with him and pursued after him, a seven-day journey, and he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead. 24 And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Take care that you not speak with Jacob, whether good or evil.” 25 And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban and his kinsmen pitched their tents in the hill country of Gilead. 26 Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done that you tricked me and have carried off my daughters like captives of the sword? 27 Why did you hide your intention to flee and trick me, and did not tell me so that I would have sent you away with joy and song and tambourine and lyre? 28 And why did you not give me opportunity to kiss my grandsons and my daughters goodbye? Now you have behaved foolishly by doing this. 29 It is in my power to do harm to you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night saying, ‘Take care from speaking with Jacob, whether good or evil.’ 30 Now, you have surely gone because you desperately longed for the house of your father, but why did you steal my gods?” 31 Then Jacob answered and said to Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I thought, ‘Lest you take your daughters from me by force.’ 32 But with whomever you find your gods, he shall not live. In the presence of your kinsmen now identify what is with me that is yours and take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them. 33 Then Laban went into Jacob’s tent and Leah’s tent and the tent of the two female servants and did not find his gods. And he came out of Leah’s tent and went into Rachel’s tent. 34 Now Rachel had taken the idols and put them in the saddle bag of the camel and sat on them. And Laban searched the whole tent thoroughly but did not find them. 35 And she said to her father, “Let there not be anger in the eyes of my lord, for I am not able to rise before you, for the way of women is with me. And he searched carefully and did not find the idols. 36 Then Jacob became angry and quarreled with Laban. Jacob answered and said to Laban, “What is my offense? What is my sin that you pursued after me? 37 For you have searched all my possessions, and what did you find of all the possessions of your household? Set it before my kinsmen and your kinsmen that they may decide between the two of us! 38 These twenty years I was with you; your ewes and your female goats did not miscarry, and the rams of your flocks I did not eat. 39 I brought no mangled carcass to you—I bore its loss. From my hand you sought it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 40 There I was, during the day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. 41 These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. 42 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac had not been with me, indeed now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my misery and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night.” 43 Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters and the grandsons are my grandsons, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see, it is mine. Now, what can I do for these my daughters today, or for their children whom they have borne? 44 So now, come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be a witness between me and you.” 45 And Jacob took a stone and set it up as a stone pillar. 46 And Jacob said to his kinsmen, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a pile of stones, and they ate there by the pile of stones. 47 And Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. 48 Then Laban said, “This pile of stones is a witness between me and you today.” Therefore its name is called Galeed, 49 and Mizpah, because he said, “Yahweh watch between me and you when we are out of sight of each other. 50 If you mistreat my daughters, and if you take wives besides my daughters, when there is no man with us, see—God is a witness between me and you.” 51 And Laban said to Jacob, “See, this pile of stones, and see the pillar that I have set up between me and you. 52 This pile of stones is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this pile of stones to you, and that you will not pass beyond this pile of stones and this pillar to me intending harm. 53 May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father judge between us.” Then Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. 54 And Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice on the hill, and he called his kinsmen to eat the meal. And they ate the meal and spent the night on the hill. 55 And Laban arose early in the morning and kissed his grandsons and his daughters, and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned to his homeland.

Genesis,"1 And Jacob went on his way, and angels of God met him. 2 And when he saw them, Jacob said, “This is the camp of God!” And he called the name of that place Mahanaim. 3 Then Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the territory of Edom. 4 And he instructed them, saying, “Thus you must say to my lord, to Esau, ‘Thus says your servant Jacob, I have dwelled as an alien with Laban, and I have remained there until now. 5 And I have acquired cattle, male donkeys, flocks, and male and female slaves, and I have sent to tell my lord, to find favor in your eyes.’ ” 6 And the messengers returned to Jacob and said, “We came to your brother, to Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.” 7 Then Jacob was very frightened and distressed. So he divided the people, flocks, cattle, and camels that were with him into two companies. 8 And he thought, “If Esau comes to one company and destroys it, the remaining company will be able to escape.” 9 Then Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Yahweh, who said to me, ‘Return to your land and to your family, and I will deal well with you.’ 10 I am not worthy of all the loyal love and all the faithfulness that you have shown your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps. 11 Please rescue me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and attack me, mother and children alike. 12 Now you yourself said, ‘I will surely deal well with you and make your offspring as the sand of the sea that cannot be counted for abundance.’ ” 13 And he lodged there that night. Then he took from what he had with him a gift for Esau his brother: 14 two hundred female goats, twenty male goats, two hundred ewes, twenty rams, 15 thirty milk camels with their young, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten male donkeys. 16 And he put them under the hand of his servants, herd by herd, and said to his servants, “Cross on ahead before me, and put some distance between herds. 17 And he instructed the foremost, saying, “When Esau my brother comes upon you and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you and where are you going? To whom do these animals belong ahead of you?’ 18 Then you must say, ‘To your servant, to Jacob. It is a gift sent to my lord, to Esau. Now behold, he is also coming after us.’ ” 19 And he also instructed the second servant and the third, and everyone else who was behind the herds, saying, “You must speak to Esau according to this word when you find him. 20 And moreover, you shall say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is behind us.’ ” For he thought, “Let me appease him with the gift going before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will show me favor.” 21 So the gift passed on before him, but he himself spent that night in the camp. 22 That night he arose and took his two wives, his two female slaves, and his eleven children and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. 23 And he took them and sent them across the stream. Then he sent across all his possessions. 24 And Jacob remained alone, and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the dawn. 25 And when he saw that he could not prevail against him, he struck his hip socket, so that Jacob’s hip socket was sprained as he wrestled with him. 26 Then he said, “Let me go, for dawn is breaking.” But he answered, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.” 27 Then he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.” 28 And he said, “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed.” 29 Then Jacob asked and said, “Please tell me your name.” And he said, “Why do you ask this—for my name?” And he blessed him there. 30 Then Jacob called the name of the place Peniel which means “I have seen God face to face and my life was spared.” 31 Then the sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip. 32 Therefore the Israelites do not eat the sinew of the sciatic nerve that is upon the socket of the hip unto this day, because he struck the socket of the thigh of Jacob at the sinew of the sciatic nerve.

And he divided the children among Leah and among Rachel, and among the two of his female slaves. 2 And he put the female slaves and their children first, then Leah and her children next, then Rachel with Joseph last. 3 And he himself passed on before them and bowed down to the ground seven times until he came to his brother. 4 But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell upon his neck and kissed him, and they wept. 5 Then Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said, “Who are these with you?” And he said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.” 6 Then the female slaves drew near, they and their children, and they bowed down. 7 Then Leah and her children drew near and bowed down, and afterward Joseph and Rachel drew near and they bowed down. 8 And he said, “What do you mean by all this company that I have met?” Then he said, “To find favor in the eyes of my lord.” 9 Then Esau said, “I have enough my brother; keep what you have.” 10 And Jacob said, “No, please, if I have found favor in your eyes, you must take my gift from my hand, for then I have seen your face which is like seeing the face of God, and you have received me. 11 Please take my gift which has been brought to you, for God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” And he urged him, so he took it. 12 Then he said, “Let us journey and go on, and I will go ahead of you.” 13 But he said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and the flocks and the cattle which are nursing are a concern to me. Now if they drove them hard for a day all the flocks would die. 14 Let my lord pass on before his servant and I will move along slowly at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me, and at the pace of the children until I come to my lord in Seir.” 15 And Esau said, “Let me leave some of my people with you.” But he said, “What need is there? Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.” 16 So Esau turned that day on his way to Seir. 17 But Jacob traveled on to Succoth, and he built for himself a house, and he made shelters for his livestock. Therefore he called the name of the place Succoth. 18 And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-Aram. And he camped before the city. 19 And he bought a piece of land where he pitched his tent for one hundred pieces of money from the hand of the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem. 20 And there he erected an altar and called it “El Elohe Israel.” ",Genesis 33,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/genesis-33-187368/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-06-06_genesis-33_20110517141912.mp3
Genesis,"1 Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 2 And Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. And he took her and lay with her and raped her. 3 And his soul clung to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to the girl. 4 So Shechem said to Hamor his father, saying, “Get this girl for me as a wife.” 5 And Jacob heard that Dinah his daughter had been defiled, but his sons were with his flocks in the field. And Jacob kept silent until they came. 6 And Hamor, father of Shechem, went out to Jacob to speak with him. 7 And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. And the men were distressed and very angry because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by having sexual relations with the daughter of Jacob—something that should not be done. 8 And Hamor spoke with them saying, “Shechem my son is in love with your daughter. Please give her to him for a wife. 9 Make marriages with us. Give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves. 10 You shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you; settle and trade in it, and acquire property in it.” 11 Then Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will do. 12 Make the bride price and gift as high as you like; I will give what you say to me. But give me the girl as a wife.” 13 Then the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor speaking deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister. 14 And they said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for that is a disgrace for us. 15 Only on this condition will we give consent to you; if you will become like us—every male among you to be circumcised. 16 Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take for ourselves your daughters, and we will live with you and become one family. 17 But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we will take our daughters and we will go.” 18 And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor and in the eyes of Shechem, the son of Hamor. 19 And the young man did not delay to do the thing, for he wanted the daughter of Jacob. Now he was the most honored of his father’s house. 20 Then Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city, and they spoke to the men of their city, saying, 21 “These men are at peace with us. Let them dwell in the land and let them trade in it. Now, behold, the land is broad enough for them. Let us take their daughters as wives, and let us give our daughters to them. 22 Only on this condition will the men give consent to us, to live with us and to become one family—when every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised. 23 Will not their livestock and their property and all their animals be ours? Only let us give consent to them so they will live among us.” 24 And all those who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem. Every male was circumcised, all those who went out of the gate of his city. 25 And it happened that on the third day, while they were in pain, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dinah, each took his sword and came against the unsuspecting city and killed all the males. 26 They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword, and they took Dinah from the house of Shechem and went out. 27 The other sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister. 28 They took their flocks and their cattle and their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and whatever was in the field. 29 They captured and plundered all that was in the houses—all their wealth, their little ones, and their women. 30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me, making me stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites! I am few in number! If they gather against me and attack me, I will be destroyed—I and my household!” 31 But they said, “Shall he treat our sister like a prostitute?” ",Genesis 34,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/genesis-34-187369/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-06-07_genesis-34_20110517142057.mp3
Genesis,"1 And God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there, and make an altar to the God who appeared to you when you fled from before Esau your brother.” 2 Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that are in your midst and purify yourselves and change your garments. 3 Then let us make ready and let us go up to Bethel, so that I can make an altar there to the God who answered me in the day of my trouble, and who has been with me on the way that I have gone.” 4 So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that were in their hands, and the ornamental rings that were in their ears. And Jacob buried them under the oak which was near Shechem. 5 Then they set out on their journey, and the terror of God was upon the cities that were all around them, so that they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 6 And Jacob came to Luz which was in the land of Canaan (that is Bethel), he and all the people that were with him. 7 And he built an altar there and called the place El-Bethel, for there God had appeared to him when he fled before his brother. 8 And Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, died. And she was buried below Bethel, under the oak. And its name was called Allon-Bacuth. 9 And God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan-Aram, and he blessed him. 10 And God said to him, “Your name is Jacob. Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.” Then his name was called Israel. 11 And God said to him, “I am El-Shaddai. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and an assemblage of nations shall be from you, and kings shall go out from your loins. 12 And as for the land that I gave to Abraham and to Isaac, I will give it to you. And to your descendants after you I will give the land. 13 And God went up from him at the place where he spoke with him. 14 And Jacob set up a pillar at the place where God had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. And he poured out a drink offering upon it, and poured oil on it. 15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him Bethel. 16 Then they journeyed from Bethel. And when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor. And she had hard labor. 17 And when her labor was the most difficult the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid for you have another son.” 18 And it happened that when her life was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-Oni. But his father called him Benjamin. 19 And Rachel died and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 20 And Jacob erected a pillar at her burial site. That is the pillar of the burial site of Rachel unto this day. 21 And Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder. 22 And while Israel was living in that land Reuben went and had sexual relations with Bilhah, his father’s concubine. And Israel heard about it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. 23 The sons of Leah: The firstborn of Jacob was Reuben. Then Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 24 The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. 25 The sons of Bilhah, the female slave of Rachel: Dan and Naphtali. 26 The sons of Zilpah, the female slave of Leah: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-Aram. 27 And Jacob came to Isaac his father at Mamre, or Kiriath-Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac dwelled as aliens. 28 Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years. 29 And Isaac passed away and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.

Genesis,"1 Now these are the descendants of Esau (that is, Edom). 2 Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah, daughter of Elon, the Hittite, and Oholibamah, daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite, 3 and Basemath, the daughter of Ishmael, the sister of Nebaioth. 4 And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bore Reuel; 5 and Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan. 6 And Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters, and all the persons of his household, and his sheep and goats, and all his cattle, and all the goods that he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to a land away from his brother Jacob. 7 For their possessions were too many to live together, so that the land of their sojourning was not able to support them on account of their livestock. 8 So Esau dwelled in the hill country of Seir (Esau, that is Edom). 9 Now these are the descendants of Esau, the father of Edom, in the hill country of Seir. 10 These are the names of the sons of Esau: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, the wife of Esau; Reuel, the son of Basemath, the wife of Esau. 11 The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 12 (Now Timnah was the concubine of Eliphaz, the son of Esau. And she bore Amalek to Eliphaz.) These are the sons of Adah, the wife of Esau. 13 Now these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the sons of Basemath, the wife of Esau. 14 Now these are the sons of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon, the wife of Esau: She bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. 15 These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau: the chiefs of Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 16 Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah. 17 Now these are the sons of Reuel, the son of Esau: the chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Basemath, the wife of Esau. 18 Now these are the sons of Oholibamah, the wife of Esau: the chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the chiefs born of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the wife of Esau. 19 These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs (that is, Edom). 20 These are the sons of Seir, the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 21 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom. 22 And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. And Lotan’s sister was Timna. 23 Now these are the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 24 Now these are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah—he is Anah who found the hot springs in the desert while he pastured the donkeys of Zibeon his father. 25 Now these are the sons of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah. 26 Now these are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Keran. 27 These are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. 28 These are the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran. 29 These are the chiefs of the Horites: the chiefs Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 30 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir. 31 Now these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king ruled over the Israelites. 32 Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom. And the name of his city was Dinhabah. 33 And Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zerah from Bozrah, reigned in his place. 34 And Jobab died, and Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place. 35 And Husham died, and Hadad, son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the field of Moab reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Avith. 36 And Hadad died, and Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place. 37 And Samlah died, and Shaul from Rehoboth on the Euphrates reigned in his place. 38 And Shaul died, and Baal-Hanan, the son of Acbor, reigned in his place. 39 And Baal-Hanan the son of Acbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Pau, and the name of his wife was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahab. 40 Now these are the names of the chiefs of Esau according to their families, according to their dwelling places, by their names: the chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 41 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 42 Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 43 Magdiel, and Iram.

Genesis,"1 And Jacob settled in the land of the sojourning of his father, in the land of Canaan. 2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, when seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers. Now he was a helper with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, the wives of his father. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father. 3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, for he was a son of his old age. And he made a robe with long sleeves for him. 4 When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and were not able to speak peaceably to him. 5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers. And they hated him even more. 6 And he said to them, “Listen now to this dream that I dreamed. 7 Now behold, we were binding sheaves in the midst of the field and, behold, my sheaf stood up and it remained standing. Then behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.” 8 Then his brothers said to him, “Will you really reign over us? Or will you truly rule over us?” And they hated him even more on account of his dream and because of his words. 9 Then he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brothers. And he said, “Behold, I dreamed a dream again, and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” 10 And he told it to his father and to his brothers. And his father rebuked him and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down to the ground to you?” 11 And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind. 12 Now his brothers went to pasture the flock of their father in Shechem. 13 And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing in Shechem? Come, let me send you to them.” And he said to him, “Here I am.” 14 Then he said to him, “Go now, see if it goes well for your brothers and for the flock, then return word to me.” And he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he arrived at Shechem. 15 And a man found him, and behold, he was wandering about in a field. And the man asked him, “What do you seek?” 16 And he said, “I am seeking my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are pasturing.” 17 And the man said, “They have moved on from here, for I heard them saying, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’ ” Then Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan. 18 And they saw him from a distance. And before he drew near to them, they conspired against him to kill him. 19 And each said to his brothers, “Look, this master of dreams is coming.

Genesis,"20 Now then, come, let us kill him and throw him in one of the pits. Then we will say a wild animal devoured him. Then we will see what his dreams become.” 21 And Reuben heard it and delivered him from their hand and said, “We must not take his life.” 22 And Reuben said to them, “You must not shed blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the desert, but do not lay a hand on him”—so that he might rescue him from their hand to return him to his father. 23 And it happened that as Joseph came to his brothers they stripped Joseph of his robe, the robe with long sleeves, that was upon him. 24 And they took him and threw him into the pit (the pit was empty; there was no water in it). 25 Then they sat down to eat some food. And they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead. And their camels were carrying aromatic gum and balm and spices on the way to Egypt. 26 Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is there if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? 27 Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, but our hand shall not be against him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers agreed. 28 Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and brought him up from the pit, and they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph to Egypt. 29 Then Reuben returned to the pit and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit. And he tore his clothes. 30 And he returned to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone! Now I, what can I do?” 31 Then they took the robe of Joseph and slaughtered a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood. 32 Then they sent the robe with long sleeves and they brought it to their father and said, “We found this; please examine it. Is it the robe of your son or not?” 33 And he recognized it and said, “The robe of my son! A wild animal has devoured him! Joseph is surely torn to pieces!” 34 And Jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days. 35 And all his sons and all his daughters tried to console him, but he refused to be consoled. And he said, “No, I shall go down to my son, to Sheol, mourning.” And his father wept for him. 36 And the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh, a commander of the guard. 1 And it happened that at that time Judah went down from his brothers and pitched his tent near a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.

Genesis,"1 And it happened that at that time Judah went down from his brothers and pitched his tent near a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 2 And Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite there whose name was Shua. And he took her and went in to her. 3 And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er. 4 And she conceived again and bore a son, and he called his name Onan. 5 And once again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. And he was in Chezib when she bore him. 6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 7 And Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and Yahweh killed him. 8 Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to the wife of your brother and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.” 9 But Onan knew that the offspring would not be for him, so whenever he went in to the wife of his brother he would waste it on the ground so as not to give offspring to his brother. 10 And what he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh, so he killed him also. 11 Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Stay a widow in your father’s house until Shelah my son grows up,” for he feared he would also die like his brother. So Tamar went and stayed in the house of her father. 12 And in the course of time the daughter of Shua, the wife of Judah, died. When Judah was consoled he went up to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite, to Timnah. 13 And it was told to Tamar, saying, “Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.” 14 So she removed the clothes of her widowhood and covered herself with the veil and disguised herself. And she sat at the entrance to Eynayim, which is on the way to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah was grown but she had not been given to him as a wife. 15 And Judah saw her and reckoned her to be a prostitute, for she had covered her face. 16 And he turned aside to her at the roadside and said, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, “What will you give to me that you may come in to me?” 17 And he said, “I will send a kid from the goats of the flock.” And she said, “Only if you give a pledge until you send it.” 18 And he said, “What is the pledge that I must give to you?” And she said, “your seal, your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.” And he gave them to her and went in to her. And she conceived by him. 19 And she arose and left, and she removed her veil from herself and put on the garments of her widowhood. 20 And Judah sent the kid from the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the hand of the woman, but he could not find her. 21 So he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is that cult prostitute that was at Eynayim by the roadside?” And they said, “There is no cult prostitute here.” 22 Then he returned to Judah and said, “I could not find her. Morever, the men of the place said, ‘There is no cult prostitute here.’ ” 23 And Judah said, “Let her take them for herself, lest we be laughed at. Behold, I sent this kid, but you could not find her.” 24 And about three months later it was told to Judah, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the whore, and now, behold, she has conceived by prostitution.” And Judah said, “Bring her out and let her be burned.” 25 She was brought out, but she sent to her father-in-law saying, “By the man to whom these belong I have conceived.” And she said, “Now discern to whom these belong: the seal and cord and the staff.” 26 Then Judah recognized them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not know her again. 27 And it happened that at the time she gave birth that, behold, twins were in her womb. 28 And it happened that at her labor one child put out a hand. And the midwife took it and tied a crimson thread on his hand saying, “This one came out first.” 29 Then his hand drew back and, behold, his brother came out, and she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” And she called his name Perez. 30 And afterward his brother who had the crimson thread on his hand came out. And his name was called Zerah. 1 Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh, commander of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there. 2 And Yahweh was with Joseph, and he became a successful man.

Genesis,"1 Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh, commander of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there. 2 And Yahweh was with Joseph, and he became a successful man. And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian. 3 And his master observed that Yahweh was with him, and everything that was in his hand to do Yahweh made successful. 4 And Joseph found favor in his eyes and he served him. Then he appointed him over his house and all that he owned he put into his hand. 5 And it happened that from the time he appointed him over his house and over all that he had, Yahweh blessed the house of the Egyptian on account of Joseph. And the blessing of Yahweh was upon all that he had in the house and in the field. 6 And he left all that he had in the hand of Joseph, and he did not worry about anything except the food that he ate. Now Joseph was well built and handsome. 7 And it happened that after these things his master’s wife cast her eyes on Joseph, and she said, “Lie with me.” 8 But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Look, my master does not worry about what is in the house, and everything he owns he has put in my hand. 9 He has no greater authority in this house than me, and he has not withheld anything from me except you, since you are his wife. Now how could I do this great wickedness and sin against God?” 10 And it happened that as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he did not heed her to lie beside her or to be with her. 11 But one particular day he came into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house were there in the house, 12 she seized him by his garment and said, “Lie with me!” And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and he went outside. 13 And it happened that when she saw that he left his garment in her hand and fled outside, 14 she called to the men of her house and said to them, “Look! He brought a Hebrew man to us to mock us! He came to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice. 15 And when he heard me, that I raised my voice and called out, he left his garment beside me and fled, and he went outside.” 16 Then she put his garment beside her until his master came to his house. 17 Then she spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew slave that you brought to us came to me to make fun of me. 18 And it happened that as I raised my voice and called out, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.” 19 And when his master heard the words of his wife that she spoke to him, “This is what your servant did to me,” he became very angry. 20 And Joseph’s master took him and put him into prison, the place that the king’s prisoners were confined. And he was there in prison. 21 And Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed loyal love to him, and gave him favor in the eyes of the chief of the prison. 22 And the chief of the prison put all the prisoners that were in the prison into the hand of Joseph. And everything that was done there, he was the one who did it. 23 The chief of the prison did not worry about anything in his hand, since Yahweh was with him. And whatever he did Yahweh made it successful.

Genesis,"1 And it happened that after these things the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker did wrong against their lord, against the king of Egypt. 2 And Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, with the chief cupbearer and chief baker. 3 And he put them in custody in the house of the commander of the guard, into the prison where Joseph was confined. 4 And the commander of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he attended them. And they were in custody many days. 5 And the two of them, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, dreamed a dream one night, each his own dream, with its own interpretation. 6 When Joseph came to them in the morning he looked at them, and behold, they were troubled. 7 And he asked the court officials of Pharaoh that were with him in the custody of his master’s house, “Why are your faces sad today?” 8 And they said to him, “We each dreamed a dream, but there is no one to interpret it.” And Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me.” 9 Then the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and he said to him, “In my dream, now behold, there was a vine before me, 10 and on the vine were three branches. And as it budded, its blossoms came up, and its clusters of grapes grew ripe. 11 And the cup of Pharaoh was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them into the cup of Pharaoh. Then I placed the cup into the hand of Pharaoh.” 12 Then Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: The three branches, they are three days. 13 In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and will restore you to your office. And you shall put the cup of Pharaoh into his hand as was formerly the custom, when you were his cupbearer. 14 But remember me when it goes well with you, and please may you show kindness with respect to me, and mention me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. 15 For I was surely kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me in this pit.” 16 And when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said to Joseph, “I also dreamed. In my dream, now behold, there were three baskets of bread upon my head. 17 And in the upper basket were all sorts of baked foods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket upon my head.” 18 Then Joseph answered and said, “This is its interpretation: The three baskets, they are three days. 19 In three days Pharaoh will lift your head from you and hang you on a pole, and the birds will eat your flesh from you.” 20 And it happened that on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants. And he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker in the midst of his servants. 21 And he restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing position. And he placed the cup in the hand of Pharaoh. 22 But the chief baker he hanged as Joseph had interpreted to them. 23 But the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.

Genesis,"1 And it happened that after two full years Pharaoh dreamed, and behold, he was standing by the Nile. 2 And behold, seven cows, well built and fat, were coming up from the Nile, and they grazed among the reeds. 3 And behold, seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, ugly and gaunt, and they stood beside those cows on the bank of the Nile. 4 And the ugly and gaunt cows ate the seven well built and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke. 5 And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time, and behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were coming out of one stalk. 6 And behold, seven thin ears of grain, scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them. 7 And the thin ears of grain swallowed up the seven plump and full ears of grain. Then Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. 8 And it happened that in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called all of the magicians of Egypt, and all its wise men, and Pharaoh told his dream to them. But they had no interpretation for Pharaoh. 9 Then the chief of the cupbearers spoke with Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my sins today. 10 Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the house of the commander of the guard. 11 And we dreamed a dream one night, I and he, each with a dream that had a meaning. 12 And there with us was a young man, a Hebrew servant of the commander of the guard, and we told him the dream, and he interpreted our dreams for us, each according to his dream he interpreted. 13 And it happened just as he interpreted to us, so it was. He restored me to my office, and him he hanged.” 14 Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they brought him quickly from the prison. And he shaved and changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh. 15 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I dreamed a dream, but there is none to interpret it. Now, I have heard concerning you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” 16 Then Joseph answered Pharaoh saying, “It is not in my power; God will answer concerning the well-being of Pharaoh.” 17 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now in my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 18 and behold, seven cows, well built and fat, were coming up from the Nile, and they grazed among the reeds. 19 And behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly looking and gaunt—never have I seen any as them in all the land of Egypt for ugliness. 20 And the thin and ugly cows ate the former seven healthy cows. 21 But when they went into their bellies it could not be known that they went into their bellies, for their appearance was as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke. 22 Then I saw in my dream and behold, seven ears of grain were coming out of one stalk, full and good. 23 And behold, seven withered ears of grain, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them. 24 And the thin ears of grain swallowed up the seven good ears of grain. And I told the magicians, but there was none to explain it to me.” 25 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. 26 The seven good cows, they are seven years, and the seven good ears of grain, they are seven years. The dreams are one. 27 And the seven thin and ugly cows coming up after them, they are seven years, and the seven empty ears of grain, scorched by the east wind, they are also seven years of famine. 28 This is the word that I have spoken to Pharaoh; God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. 29 Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the whole land of Egypt. 30 Then seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten. The famine will consume the land. 31 Abundance in the land will not be known because of the famine that follows, for it will be very heavy. 32 Now concerning the repetition of the dream twice to Pharaoh, it is because the matter is established by God, and God will do it quickly. 33 Now then, let Pharaoh select a man who is discerning and wise, and let him set him over the land of Egypt. 34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint supervisors over the land, and let him take one-fifth from the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance. 35 Then let them gather all the food of these coming good years and let them pile up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. 36 Then the food shall be as a deposit for the land for the seven years of the famine that will be in the land of Egypt, that the land will not perish on account of the famine.” 37 And the plan was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants. 38 Then Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this in whom is the spirit of God?” 39 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all of this known to you there is no one as discerning and wise as you. 40 You shall be over my house, and to your word all my people shall submit. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.” 41 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” 42 Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his finger and put it on the finger of Joseph. And he clothed him with garments of fine linen, and he put a chain of gold around his neck. 43 And he had him ride in his second chariot. And they cried out before him, “Kneel!” And Pharaoh set him over all the land of Egypt. 44 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your consent no one will lift his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.” 45 And Pharaoh called the name of Joseph Zaphenath-paneah and gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, as a wife. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.

Genesis,"46 Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and traveled through the whole land of Egypt. 47 And the land produced a plenty in the seven years of abundance. 48 And he gathered all the food of the seven years which occurred in the land of Egypt. And he stored the food in the cities. The food of the field that surrounded each city he stored in its midst. 49 And Joseph piled up grain like the sand of the sea in great abundance until he stopped counting it, for it could not be counted. 50 Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him. 51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, for he said, “God has caused me to forget all my hardship and all my father’s house.” 52 And the name of the second he called Ephraim, for he said, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my misfortune.” 53 And the seven years of abundance which were in the land of Egypt came to an end. 54 And the seven years of famine began to come as Joseph had said. And there was famine in all of the countries, but in all the land of Egypt there was food. 55 And when all the land of Egypt was hungry the people cried out to Pharaoh for food. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; what he says to you, you must do.” 56 And the famine was over the whole land, and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold food to the Egyptians. And the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. 57 And every land came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, for the famine was severe in every land. 1 When Jacob realized that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?” 2 Then he said, “Look, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy grain for us there that we may live and not die.” 3 And the ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain from Egypt. 4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, with his brothers, for he feared harm would come to him. 5 Then the sons of Israel went to buy grain amid those other people who went as well, for there was famine in the land of Canaan. 6 Now Joseph was the governor over the land. He was the one who sold food to all the people of the land. And the brothers of Joseph came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground. 7 And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger to them. And he spoke with them harshly and said to them, “From where have you come?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.” 8 And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. 9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed concerning them, and he said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land!” 10 And they said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. 11 We all are sons of one man. We are honest men. We, your servants, are not spies.” 12 Then he said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.” 13 Then they said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, but behold, the youngest is with our father today, and one is no more.” 14 But Joseph said to them, “It is what I said to you—you are spies.

Genesis,"15 By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh you will not go out from here unless your youngest brother comes here. 16 Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, but you will be kept in prison so that your words might be tested to see if there is truth with you. And if not, by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.” 17 Then he gathered them into the prison for three days. 18 On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live; I fear God. 19 If you are honest, let one of your brothers be kept in prison where you are now being kept, but the rest of you go, carry grain for the famine for your households. 20 You must bring your youngest brother to me, and then your words will be confirmed and you will not die.” And they did so. 21 Then each said to his brother, “Surely we are guilty on account of our brother when we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded for mercy to us and we would not listen. Therefore this trouble has come to us.” 22 Then Reuben answered them, saying, “Did I not say to you, do not sin against the boy? But you did not listen, and now, behold, his blood has been sought.” 23 Now they did not know that Joseph understood, for the interpreter was between them. 24 And he turned away from them and wept. Then he returned to them and spoke to them, and took Simeon from them and tied him up in front of them. 25 Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to return their money to each sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. Thus he did for them. 26 Then they loaded their grain upon their donkeys and went away from there. 27 And one of them later opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodging place and saw his money—behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. 28 And he said to his brothers, “My money was returned and moreover, behold, it is in my sack!” Then their hearts failed them and each of them trembled and said, “What is this God has done to us?” 29 And when they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan they told him everything that had happened to them, saying, 30 “The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and treated us as if we were spying out the land. 31 But we said to him, ‘We are honest; we are not spies. 32 We are twelve brothers, the sons of our father. One is no more and the youngest is with our father now in the land of Canaan.’ 33 Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest. Leave one of your brothers with me, and take food for the famine in your households and go. 34 And bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies but you are honest. I will give your brother back to you, and you will trade in the land.’ ” 35 And it happened that when they emptied their sacks, behold, each one’s pouch of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw the pouches of their money, they were greatly distressed. 36 And Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me—Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and Benjamin you would take! All of this is against me! 37 Then Reuben said to his father, “You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hand and I myself will return him to you.” 38 But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone remains. If harm meets him on the journey that you would take, you would bring down my gray head in sorrow to Sheol.” 1 Now the famine in the land was severe. 2 And it happened that as they finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt their father said to them, “Return and buy a little food for us.” 3 Then Judah said to him, “The man solemnly admonished us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’ 4 If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you, 5 but if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’ ” 6 Then Israel said, “Why did you bring trouble to me by telling the man you still had a brother?” 7 And they said, “The man asked explicitly about us and about our family, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have a brother?’ And we answered him according to these words. How could we know that he would say, ‘Bring down your brother’?” 8 Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me, and let us arise and go, so that we will live and not die—you, we, and our children. 9 I myself will be surety for him. You may seek him from my hand. If I do not bring him back to you and present him before you, then I will stand guilty before you forever. 10 Surely if we had not hesitated by this time we would have returned twice.” 11 Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so then do this. Take some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift—a little balm and honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, and pistachios and almonds. 12 And take double the money with you. Take back with you the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake. 13 And take your brother. Now arise and return to the man. 14 And may El-Shaddai grant you compassion before the man that he may release your other brother to you and Benjamin. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.” 15 So the men took this gift, and they took double money in their hands, and Benjamin, and they rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.

Genesis,"16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them he said to the one who was over his household, “Bring the men into the house and slaughter and prepare an animal, for the men shall eat with me at noon.” 17 And the man did as Joseph had said, and the man brought the men into the house of Joseph. 18 And the men were afraid when they were brought into the house of Joseph. And they said “We were brought here on account of the money that was returned to our sacks the first time, that he might attack us and fall upon us to take us as slaves with our donkeys.” 19 So they approached the man who was over Joseph’s house and spoke to him at the doorway of the house. 20 And they said, “Please, my lord, we surely came down once before to buy food, 21 but when we came to the place of lodging and we opened our sacks, then behold, each one’s money was in the mouth of his sack—our money in its full weight—so we have returned with it in our hands. 22 Now, other money we have brought down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.” 23 And he said, “Peace to you; do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father must have given you a treasure in your sacks; your money came to me.” And he brought Simeon out to them. 24 Then the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and he gave them water and washed their feet, and gave fodder to their donkeys. 25 Then they laid out the gift until Joseph came at noon, for they had heard that they were to eat food there. 26 And when Joseph came into the house they brought the gift that was in their hand into the house to him, and they bowed down before him to the ground. 27 And he greeted them and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” 28 And they said, “Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.” And they knelt and bowed down. 29 Then he lifted up his eyes and saw Benjamin his brother, the son of his mother, and said, “Is this your youngest brother of whom you told me?” And he continued, “God be gracious to you, my son.” 30 Then Joseph hurried away, being overcome with emotion toward his brother, and sought for a place to cry. Then he went into a room and wept there. 31 Then he washed his face and went out, now controlling himself, and said, “Serve the food.” 32 And they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves, for Egyptians could not dine with Hebrews, because that was a detestable thing to Egyptians. 33 And they were seated before him from the firstborn according to his birthright to the youngest according to his youth. And the men looked at one another amazed. 34 And portions were served to them from his table, and the portion of Benjamin was five times greater than the portion of any of them. And they drank and became drunk with him. 1 Then he commanded the one who was over his household, saying, “Fill the sacks of the men with food as much as they are able to carry, and put each one’s money in the mouth of his sack. 2 And my cup—the cup of silver—you shall put into the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and the money for his grain. And he did according to the word of Joseph that he had commanded. 3 When the morning light came the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. 4 They went out of the city, and had not gone far when Joseph said to the one who was over his house, “Arise! Pursue after the men and overtake them. Then you shall say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good? 5 Is this not that from which my master drinks? Now he himself certainly practices divination with it. You have done evil in what you have done.’ ” 6 When he overtook them he spoke these words to them. 7 And they said to him, “Why has my lord spoken according to these words? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! 8 Behold, the money that we found in the mouth of our sacks we returned to you from the land of Canaan. Now why would we steal silver or gold from the house of my lord? 9 Whoever is found with it from among your servants shall die. And moreover, we will become slaves to my lord.” 10 Then he said, “Now also according to your words, thus will it be. He who is found with it shall be my slave, but you shall be innocent.” 11 Then each man quickly brought down his sack to the ground, and each one opened his sack. 12 And he searched, beginning with the oldest and finishing with the youngest. And the cup was found in the sack of Benjamin. 13 Then they tore their clothes, and each one loaded his donkey and they returned to the city. 14 And Judah and his brothers came to the house of Joseph—now he was still there—they fell before him to the ground. 15 Then Joseph said to them, “What is this deed that you have done? Did you not know that a man who is like me surely practices divination?” 16 And Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? Now how can we show ourselves innocent? God has found the guilt of your servants! Behold, we are slaves to my lord, both we and also he in whose hand the cup was found.” 17 But he said, “Far be it from me to do this! The man in whose hand the cup was found, he will become my slave. But as for you, go up in peace to your father.” 18 But Judah drew near to him and said, “Please my lord, let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord, and let not your anger burn against your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself. 19 My lord had asked his servants, saying, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 20 And we said to my lord, ‘We have an aged father, and a younger brother, the child of his old age, and his brother died, and he alone remains from his mother, and his father loves him.’ 21 Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me that I may set my eyes upon him.’ 22 Then we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he should leave his father, then he would die.’ 23 Then you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not again see my face.’ 24 And it happened that we went up to your servant, my father, and told him the words of my lord. 25 And when our father said, ‘Go back, buy a little food for us,’ 26 then we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we shall go down. For we will not be able to see the face of the man unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 27 Then your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You yourselves know that my wife bore two sons to me. 28 One went out from me, and I said, “Surely he must have been torn to pieces,” and I have never seen him since.

Genesis,"25 And when our father said, ‘Go back, buy a little food for us,’ 26 then we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we shall go down. For we will not be able to see the face of the man unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 27 Then your servant, my father, said to us, ‘You yourselves know that my wife bore two sons to me. 28 One went out from me, and I said, “Surely he must have been torn to pieces,” and I have never seen him since. 29 And if you take this one also from me, and he encounters harm, you will bring down my gray head in sorrow to Sheol.’ 30 So now, when I come to your servant, my father, and the boy is not with us—now his life is bound up with his life—31 it shall happen that when he sees that the boy is gone, he will die. And your servants will bring down the gray head of your servant, our father, to Sheol with sorrow. 32 For your servant is pledged as surety for the boy by my father, saying, If I do not bring him to you, then I shall be culpable to my father forever. 33 So then, please let your servant remain in place of the boy as a slave to my lord, and let the boy go up with his brothers. 34 For how can I go up to my father if the boy is not with me? I do not want to see the misery which will find my father.” 1 Then Joseph was not able to control himself before all who were standing by him. And he cried out, “Make every man go out from me!” So no one stood with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. 2 And he wept loudly, so that the Egyptians heard it and the household of Pharaoh heard it. 3 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” And his brothers were unable to answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence. 4 So Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.” And they drew near. And he said, “I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 5 So now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves that you sold me here, for God sent me as deliverance before you. 6 For these two years the famine has been in the midst of the land, but there will be five more years where there is no plowing or harvest. 7 And God sent me before you all to preserve for you a remnant in the land and to keep alive among you many survivors. 8 So now, you yourselves did not send me here, but God put me here as father to Pharaoh and as master of all his household, and a ruler over all the land of Egypt. 9 Hurry, and go up to my father and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me and do not delay. 10 You shall settle in the land of Goshen so that you will be near me, you and your children and your grandchildren, and your flocks and your herds and all that you have. 11 And I will provide for you there, because there are still five years of famine—lest you and your household and all that you have become destitute.’ 12 Now behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is I who am speaking to you. 13 And you must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt and all that you have seen. Now hurry and bring my father here.” 14 Then he fell upon the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 15 And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. And afterward his brothers spoke with him. 16 Then the report was heard in the house of Pharaoh, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” And it pleased Pharaoh and his servants. 17 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers: ‘Do this—load your donkeys and go back to the land of Canaan, 18 and take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.’ 19 And you Joseph, are commanded to say this: ‘Do this! Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives, and bring your father and come! 20 Do not worry about your possessions, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’ ” 21 And the sons of Israel did so. And Joseph gave them wagons at the word of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey. 22 To each and to all of them he gave sets of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of clothing. 23 And to his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys carrying the best of Egypt, and ten donkeys carrying grain and food and provisions for his father for the journey. 24 Then he sent his brothers away, and when they departed he said to them, “Do not be agitated on the journey.” 25 So they went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father. 26 And they spoke to him, saying, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” And his heart went numb, because he did not believe them. 27 Then they told him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them. And when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, then the spirit of Jacob their father revived. 28 And Israel said, “It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.” ",Genesis 44:25-45:28,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/genesis-44254528-193636/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-06-23_genesis-44254528_20110606115857.mp3
Genesis,"1 So Israel journeyed with all that he had, and he came to Beersheba and offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac. 2 And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, “Jacob, Jacob.” And he said, “Here I am.” 3 Then he said, “I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you a great nation there. 4 I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I myself will also bring you up. And Joseph will place his hand over your eyes.” 5 So Jacob arose from Beersheba. And the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob, and their little ones and their wives in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to transport him. 6 And they took their livestock and their possessions that they had acquired in the land of Canaan. And they came to Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him: 7 his sons and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters and his sons’ daughters, and all his offspring he brought with him into Egypt. 8 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons. Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob 9 and the sons of Reuben: Enoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 10 The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. 11 The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 12 The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 13 The sons of Issachar: Tolah, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron. 14 The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 15 These are the sons of Leah that she bore to Jacob in Paddan-Aram, and Dinah his daughter. His sons and his daughters were thirty-three persons in all. 16 The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. 17 The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah, and their sister Serah. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malkiel. 18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob—sixteen persons. 19 The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 20 And Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him, were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt. 21 The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 22 These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob—fourteen persons in all. 23 The sons of Dan: Hushim. 24 The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 25 These are the sons of Bilhah whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob—seven persons in all. 26 All the persons belonging to Jacob who came to Egypt who were his descendants, not including the wives of the sons of Jacob were sixty-six persons in all. 27 And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt were two persons. All the persons of the house of Jacob who came to Egypt were seventy. 28 He had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to appear before him in Goshen. And they came to the land of Goshen. 29 Then Joseph harnessed his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen. He presented himself to him and fell upon his neck and wept upon his neck a long time. 30 Then Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die since I have seen your face, for you are still alive.” 31 Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and report to Pharaoh, and I will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Canaan have come to me. 32 And the men are shepherds, for they are men of livestock, and they have brought their flocks and their cattle and all that they have.’ 33 And it shall be that when Pharaoh calls you he will say, ‘What is your occupation?’ 34 Then you must say, ‘You servants are men of livestock from our childhood until now, both we and also our ancestors,’ so that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is a detestable thing to Egyptians.” ",Genesis 46,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/genesis-46-193645/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-06-24_genesis-46_20110606122657.mp3
Genesis,"1 So Joseph went and reported to Pharaoh. And he said, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and their herds, and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan. Now they are here in the land of Goshen.” 2 And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them before Pharaoh. 3 And Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and also our ancestors.” 4 And they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servant’s flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. So now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” 5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 6 The land of Egypt is before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them live in the land of Goshen, and if you know there is among them men of ability, then appoint them overseers of my own livestock.” 7 Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 8 Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How old are you?” 9 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojourning are one hundred and thirty years. Few and hard have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not reached the days of the years of the lives of my ancestors in the days of their sojourning.” 10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and he went out from the presence of Pharaoh. 11 And Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and he gave them property in the land of Egypt in the best part of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had instructed. 12 And Joseph provided his father and his brothers and all the household of his father with food, according to the number of their children. 13 Now there was no food in all the land, for the famine was very severe. And the land of Egypt languished, with the land of Canaan, on account of the famine. 14 And Joseph collected all the money found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain that they were buying. And Joseph brought the money into the house of Pharaoh. 15 And when the money was spent in the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan, all of Egypt came to Joseph, saying, “Give us food! Why should we die before you? For the money is used up.” 16 And Joseph said, “Give your livestock and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock if your money is used up.” 17 So they brought their herds to Joseph, and Joseph gave food to them in exchange for horses, their flocks, and their cattle and donkeys. And he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year. 18 When that year ended, they came to him in the following year and said to him, “We cannot hide from my lord that our money and livestock belong to my lord. Nothing remains before my lord except our bodies and our land. 19 Why should we die in front of you, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, then we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Then give us seed and we shall live and not die, and the land will not become desolate.” 20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for each Egyptian sold his field, for the famine was severe upon them. And the land became Pharaoh’s. 21 As for the people, he transferred them to the cities, from one end of the territory of Egypt to the other. 22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for there was an allotment for the priests from Pharaoh, and they lived on the allotment that Pharaoh gave to them. Therefore they did not sell their land. 23 And Joseph said to the people, “Look, I have bought you and your land this day for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you so you can sow the land. 24 And it shall happen that at the harvest, you must give a fifth to Pharaoh and four-fifths shall be yours, as seed for the field and for your food and for those who are in your households, and as food for your little ones.” 25 And they said, “You have saved our lives. If we have found favor in the eyes of my lord, we will be servants to Pharaoh.” 26 So Joseph made it a statute unto this day concerning the land of Egypt: one fifth to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests alone did not belong to Pharaoh. 27 So Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they acquired possessions in it and were fruitful and multiplied greatly. 28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. And the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred and forty-seven years. 29 When the time of Israel’s death drew near, he called to his son, to Joseph. And he said to him, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please put your hand under my thigh, that you might vow to deal kindly and faithfully with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt, 30 but let me lie with my ancestors. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial site.” And he said, “I will do according to your word.” 31 Then he said, “Swear to me.” And he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself on the head of the bed.

Genesis,"1 And it happened that after these things, it was said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is ill.” And he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim. 2 And it was told to Jacob, “Behold, your son Joseph has come to you.” Then Israel strengthened himself and he sat up in the bed. 3 Then Jacob said to Joseph, “El-Shaddai appeared to me in Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 4 and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and make you numerous, and will make you a company of nations. And I will give this land to your offspring after you as an everlasting possession.’ 5 And now, your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before my coming to you in Egypt, are mine. Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine as Reuben and Simeon are. 6 And your children whom you father after them shall be yours. By the name of their brothers they shall be called, with respect to their inheritance. 7 As for me, when I came from Paddan-Aram, Rachel died to my sorrow in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath. And I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).” 8 When Israel saw the sons of Joseph he said, “Who are these?” 9 Then Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons whom God has given me here.” And he said, “Please bring them to me that I may bless them.” 10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim on account of old age; he was not able to see. So he brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them. 11 And Israel said to Joseph, “I did not expect to see your face and behold, God has also shown me your offspring.” 12 Then Joseph removed them from his knees and bowed down with his face to the ground. 13 And Joseph took the two of them, Ephraim at his right to the left of Israel, and Manasseh at his left to the right of Israel. And he brought them near to him. 14 And Israel stretched out his right hand and put it on the head of Ephraim (now he was the younger), and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands, for Manasseh was the firstborn. 15 And he blessed Joseph and said, “The God before whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, walked, The God who shepherded me all my life unto this day, 16 The angel who redeemed me from all evil, may he bless the boys. And through them let my name be perpetuated, and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac. And let them multiply into many in the midst of the earth. 17 When Joseph saw that his father put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, he was displeased. And he took hold of his father’s hand to remove it from the head of Ephraim over to the head of Manasseh. 18 And Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father; because this one is the firstborn. Put your right hand upon his head.” 19 But his father refused and said, “I know, my son; I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great, but his younger brother shall be greater than him, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.” 20 So he blessed them that day, saying, Through you Israel shall pronounce blessing, saying, ‘May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.’ ” So he put Ephraim before Manasseh. 21 And Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your ancestors. 22 And I have given to you one slope of land rather than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorites by my sword and with my bow.” ",Genesis 48,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/genesis-48-193650/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-06-28_genesis-48_20110606131307.mp3
Genesis,"1 Then Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather together so that I can tell you what will happen with you in days to come. 2 Assemble and hear, O sons of Jacob! Listen to Israel your father! 3 Reuben, you are my firstborn, my strength, and the firstfruit of my vigor, excelling in rank and excelling in power. 4 Unstable as water, you shall not excel any longer, for you went up upon the bed of your father, then defiled it. You went up upon my couch! 5 Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of violence are their swords. Let me not come into their council. 6 Let not my person be joined to their company. For in their anger they killed men, and at their pleasure they hamstrung cattle. 7 Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath, for it is cruel. I will divide them in Jacob, and I will scatter them in Israel. 8 Judah, as for you, your brothers shall praise you. Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies. The sons of your father shall bow down to you. 9 Judah is a lion’s cub. From the prey, my son, you have gone up. He bowed down; he crouched like a lion and as a lioness. Who shall rouse him? 10 The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff between his feet, until Shiloh comes. And to him shall be the obedience of nations. 11 Binding his donkey to the vine and his donkey’s colt to the choice vine, he washes his clothing in the wine and his garment in the blood of grapes. 12 The eyes are darker than wine, and the teeth whiter than milk. 13 Zebulun shall settle by the shore of the sea. He shall become a haven for ships, and his border shall be at Sidon. 14 Issachar is a strong donkey, crouching between the sheepfolds. 15 He saw a resting place that was good, and land that was pleasant. So he bowed his shoulder to the burden and became a servant of forced labor.

Genesis,"16 Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel. 17 Dan shall be a serpent on the way, a viper on the road that bites the heels of a horse, so that its rider falls backward. 18 I wait for your salvation, O Yahweh. 19 Bandits shall attack Gad, but he shall attack their heels. 20 Asher’s food is delicious, and he shall provide from the king’s delicacies. 21 Naphtali is a doe running free that puts forth beautiful words. 22 Joseph is the bough of a fruitful vine, a fruitful bough by a spring. His branches climb over the wall. 23 The archers fiercely attacked him. They shot arrows at him and were hostile to him. 24 But his bow remained in a steady position; his arms were made agile by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob. From there is the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel. 25 Because of the God of your father he will help you and by Shaddai he will bless you with the blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that crouches beneath, blessings of the breasts and the womb. 26 The blessings of your father are superior to the blessings of my ancestors, to the bounty of the everlasting hills. May they be on the head of Joseph, and on the forehead of the prince of his brothers. 27 Benjamin is a devouring wolf, devouring the prey in the morning, and dividing the plunder in the evening. 28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them; each according to his blessing he blessed them. 29 Then he instructed them and said to them, “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me among my ancestors in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30 in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah that is before Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site. 31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife. And there I buried Leah—32 the purchase of the field and the cave which was in it from the Hittites.” 33 When Jacob finished instructing his sons he drew his feet up to the bed. Then he took his last breath and was gathered to his people. 1 Then Joseph fell on the face of his father and wept upon him and kissed him. 2 And Joseph instructed his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel. 3 Forty days were required for it, for thus are the days required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days. 4 When the days of his weeping had passed, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the hearing of Pharaoh, saying, 5 ‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am about to die. In my tomb that I have hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan—there you must bury me.” So then, please let me go up and let me bury my father; then I will return.’ ” 6 Then Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father as he made you swear.” 7 So Joseph went up to bury his father. And all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, went up with him, 8 with all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and the household of his father. They left only their little children and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen. 9 And there also went up with him chariots and horsemen. The company was very great. 10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which was beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful wailing. And he made a mourning ceremony for his father seven days. 11 And when the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, saw the mourning ceremony at the threshing floor of Atad they said, “This is a severe mourning for the Egyptians.” Therefore its name was called Abel-Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.12 Thus his sons did to him just as he had instructed them. 13 And his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which field Abraham had bought as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite before Mamre. 14 And after burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father. 15 And when the brothers of Joseph saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hold a grudge against us and pay us back dearly for all the evil that we did to him.” 16 So they sent word to Joseph saying, “Your father commanded us before his death, saying, 17 “Thus you must say to Joseph, ‘O, please now forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did evil to you.’ So now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” And Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 18 Then his brothers went also and fell before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” 19 Then Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God? 20 As for you, you planned evil against me, but God planned it for good, in order to do this—to keep many people alive—as it is today. 21 So then, do not be afraid. I myself will provide for you and your little ones. And he consoled them and spoke kindly to them. 22 So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and the house of his father. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. 23 And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. Moreover, the children of Makir, son of Manasseh, were born on the knees of Joseph. 24 And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will certainly visit you and bring you up from this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” 25 Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall bring up my bones from here.” 26 So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old. They embalmed him and he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.

Behold, two woes are still coming after these things. 13 And the sixth angel blew the trumpet, and I heard one voice from the horns of the golden altar that is before God 14 saying to the sixth angel, the one who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who have been bound at the great river Euphrates!” 15 And the four angels who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year were released, in order that they should kill a third of humanity. 16 And the number of the troops of the cavalry was two hundred million; I heard the number of them. 17 And in this way I saw the horses in the vision, and those seated on them, who had fiery red and hyacinth-colored and sulphurous yellow breastplates, and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and sulphur. 18 By these three plagues a third of humanity was killed—by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur that came out of their mouths. 19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails are similar in appearance to snakes, having heads, and with them they cause injury. 20 And the rest of humanity who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands, in order not to worship the demons and the gold and silver and bronze and stone and wooden idols, which are able neither to see nor to hear nor to walk, ",Revelation 9:7-20,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/revelation-97-20-156300/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-02-11_revelation-97-20_20110105154802.mp3

And he put his right foot on the sea and his left on the land. 3 And he cried out with a loud voice like a lion roars, and when he cried out, the seven thunders sounded their own voices. 4 And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up the things which the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them!” 5 And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven 6 and swore by the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, “There will be no more delay! 7 But in the days of the sound of the seventh angel, whenever he is about to blow the trumpet, then the mystery of God is completed, as he announced to his own slaves the prophets.” ",Revelation 10:2-7,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/revelation-102-7-157368/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-02-15_revelation-102-7_20110112160802.mp3

Revelation,"3 And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days, dressed in sackcloth.” 4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. 5 And if anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouth and consumes their enemies. And if anyone wants to harm them, in this way he must be killed. 6 These have the authority to shut the sky, so that it does not rain during the days of their prophecy. And they have authority over the waters, to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with every plague as often as they wish. 7 And when they have completed their testimony, the beast that comes up from the abyss will make war with them and will conquer them and will kill them. 8 And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which is called symbolically Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. 9 And those from peoples and tribes and languages and nations will see their dead bodies three and a half days, and they will not allow their dead bodies to be placed in a tomb. 10 And those who live on the earth will rejoice over them, and will celebrate and will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who live on the earth. 11 And after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. 12 And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here,” and they went up into heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.

Behold, the third woe is coming quickly! 15 And the seventh angel blew the trumpet, and there was a loud voice in heaven saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever.” 16 And the twenty-four elders who are seated on their thrones before God fell down on their faces and worshiped God, 17 saying, “We give thanks to you, Lord God All-Powerful, the one who is and the one who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign. 18 And the nations were angry, and your wrath has come, and the time for the dead to be judged, and to give their reward to your slaves the prophets and to the saints and to the ones who fear your name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.” 19 And the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant appeared in his temple, and there were lightnings and sounds and thunders and an earthquake and large hail. 1 And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun and with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars, ",Revelation 11:13-12:1,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/revelation-1113121-157371/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-02-18_revelation-1113121_20110112161403.mp3

And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, in order that whenever she gave birth to her child he could devour it. 5 And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is going to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod, and her child was snatched away to God and to his throne.

Revelation,"6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared there by God, so that they could feed her there for one thousand two hundred sixty days. 7 And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. 8 And they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them any longer in heaven. 9 And the great dragon was thrown down, the ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world.

Revelation,"10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, “Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, because the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, the one who accuses them before our God day and night. 11 And they conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives until death. 12 Because of this, rejoice, you heavens, and those who live in them! Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great anger, because he knows that he has little time!” 13 And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. 14 And the two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman, in order that she could fly into the wilderness, to her place where she is fed there for a time, and times, and half a time, from the presence of the serpent. 15 And from his mouth the serpent spouted water like a river after the woman, in order that he could make her swept away by a river. 16 And the earth came to the aid of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon had spouted out of his mouth. 17 And the dragon was angry at the woman, and went away to fight against the rest of her children, those who keep the commandments of God and who hold to the testimony about Jesus.

Revelation,"1 After these things I saw another angel descending from heaven, who had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. 2 And he cried out with a powerful voice, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and it has become a dwelling place of demons and a haunt of every unclean spirit and a haunt of every unclean bird and a haunt of every unclean and detested animal. 3 For all the nations have drunk from the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich from the power of her sensuality.” 4 And I heard another voice from heaven saying, “Come out from her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins, and so that you will not receive her plagues, 5 because her sins have reached up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes. 6 Pay back to her as she herself also paid out, and pay back double according to her deeds; in the cup that she mixed, mix double for her. 7 As much as she glorified herself and lived in luxury, give to her so much torment and mourning, because in her heart she said, ‘I sit as a queen, and am not a widow, and I will never see mourning!’ 8 Because of this her plagues will come in one day— death and mourning and famine— and she will be burned up with fire, because the Lord God who passes judgment on her is powerful!” ",Revelation 18:1-8,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/revelation-181-8-167010/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2011-03-14_revelation-181-8_20110224101820.mp3

Revelation,"11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and the one seated on it was called “Faithful” and “True,” and with justice he judges and makes war. 12 Now his eyes were a flame of fire, and on his head were many royal headbands having a name written that no one except he himself knows. 13 And he was dressed in an outer garment dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God. 14 And the armies that are in heaven, dressed in clean, white fine linen, were following him on white horses. 15 And out of his mouth came a sharp sword, so that with it he could strike the nations. And he will shepherd them with an iron rod, and he stomps the winepress of the wine of the furious wrath of God, the All-Powerful. 16 And he has a name written on his outer garment and on his thigh: “King of kings and Lord of lords.” 17 And I saw one angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly directly overhead, “Come! Assemble for the great banquet of God, 18 in order that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of military tribunes, and the flesh of the powerful, and the flesh of horses and those seated on them, and the flesh of all people, both free and slave, and small and great!” 19 And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war with the one who is seated on the horse and with his army. 20 And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs before him, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who had worshiped his image. The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulphur. 21 And the rest were killed by the sword of the one who is seated on the horse—the sword that comes out of his mouth—and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.

But it will rise up high and it will stay in its place from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, up to the Corner Gate and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses. 11 And they will dwell in it, and there will be no more ban imposed, and Jerusalem will dwell in security. 12 And this will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike all the peoples that fight against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they are standing on their feet; their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. 13 And then on that day a great panic from Yahweh will fall on them, and they will seize one another’s hand, and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of another. 14 And Judah also will fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—gold and silver, and garments in great abundance. 15 Like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, and the donkey, and every kind of animal in those camps. 16 And then every survivor from all those nations coming against Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the king, Yahweh of hosts, and celebrate the Feast of Booths. 17 And then whoever of the clans of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the king, Yahweh of hosts, it will not rain on them. 18 And if the clan of Egypt will not go up and come in, on them will be that plague Yahweh inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. 19 This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. 20 On that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, “Holy to Yahweh.” And the cooking pots in the house of Yahweh will be holy like the sacrificial basins before the altar. 21 And every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Yahweh of hosts, and all those who sacrifice will come and will take from them, and will cook in them, and there will be no longer a trader in the house of Yahweh of hosts on that day.

Morning by morning he renders his judgment; at dawn he does not fail, but an evil one knows no shame. 6 “I have cut off nations; their strongholds are deserted. I have laid waste their streets, so that none pass through. Their cities have been destroyed and are without a man, without an inhabitant. 7 I have said, ‘Surely she will fear me; she will accept discipline. Then her dwelling place will not be cut down, nor all that I have brought upon her.’ Surely they rise early; they make all their deeds corrupt. 8 “Therefore, wait for me”—a declaration of Yahweh— “for the day of my rising as a witness. For my decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out my wrath upon them, all my burning anger. For by the fire of my anger all the land shall be consumed.

Zephaniah,"9 Because then I will make the speech of the nations pure; that all of them might call on the name of Yahweh, to serve him in unison. 10 From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshipers and the daughter of my scattered ones shall bring my offering. 11 On that day you shall not be humiliated on account of all your deeds by which you have rebelled against me. For then I shall remove from your midst those exulting in your pride, and you shall no longer be haughty in my holy mountain. 12 And I will leave in your midst a people afflicted and poor, and they shall take refuge in the name of Yahweh. 13 The remnant of Israel shall not do wickedness; they shall not speak deception, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth. For they shall graze and lie down, and none shall frighten them.” 14 Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion! Cry aloud, O Israel! Rejoice and be jubilant with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem! 15 Yahweh has annulled your judgments; he has turned away your enemies. The king of Israel, Yahweh, is in your midst; you shall no longer fear misfortune. 16 On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, “Fear not, O Zion; your hands shall not hang limp. 17 Yahweh your God is in your midst; a mighty warrior who saves. He shall rejoice over you with joy; he renews you in his love; he will exult over you with singing. 18 I will gather those of you grieving on account of the feast; they were raising against her a reproach. 19 Behold, at that time I will deal with all your oppressors; I will save the lame and gather the outcast. I will change them from shame to glory and renown throughout the whole world. 20 At that time I will bring you in; at the time of my gathering you together. For I will make you renowned and praised among all the nations of the earth when I restore your fortunes before your eyes,” says Yahweh.

Habakkuk,"2 O Yahweh, how long shall I cry for help and you will not listen? How long will I cry out to you, “Violence!” and you will not save? 3 Why do you cause me to see evil while you look at trouble? Destruction and violence happen before me; contention and strife arise. 4 Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice does not go forth perpetually. For the wicked surround the righteous; therefore justice goes forth perverted. 5 “Look among the nations and see; be astonished and astounded. For a work is about to be done in your days that you will not believe if it is told. 6 For look! I am raising up the Chaldeans, the bitter and impetuous nation, the one who walks through the spacious places of earth to take possession of dwellings not belonging to it. 7 They are dreadful and awesome; their justice and their dignity proceed from themselves. 8 Their horses are more swift than leopards; they are more menacing than wolves at dusk.

Habakkuk,"7 Under affliction I saw the tents of Cushan; the tent curtains of the land of Midian trembled. 8 Was the anger of Yahweh against the rivers? Was your wrath against the rivers, or your fury against the sea, when you mounted upon your horses, upon your victory chariot? 9 You laid bare the nakedness of your bow, swearing oaths with the arrows of your word. You split the earth with rivers. 10 When the mountains saw you they writhed; a torrent of waters swept by; the deep gave its voice; it raised its hands on high. 11 Sun and moon stood still in their place; at the light of your arrows they moved about; at the gleam of the flashing of your spear. 12 In fury you marched through the earth; in anger you trampled the nations. 13 You went forth for the salvation of your people, for the salvation of your anointed. You crushed the head of the house of wickedness, laying bare from the foundation to the top. 14 You pierced the head of his warriors with his own arrows; they came like a whirlwind to scatter me, their exultation like one who devours the afflicted in ambush. 15 You trampled upon the sea with your horses, the churning of many waters. 16 I hear and my stomach shakes; my lips quiver at the sound; infection enters my bones; that which is beneath me trembles; I wait quietly for the day of trouble to come upon the people attacking us. 17 Though the fig tree does not blossom, nor there be fruit on the vines; the yield of the olive tree fails, and the cultivated fields do not yield food; the flock is cut off from the animal pen, and there is no cattle in the stalls, 18 Yet I will rejoice in Yahweh; I will exult in the God of my salvation. 19 Yahweh, my Lord, is my strength; he makes my feet like the deer; he causes me to walk on my high places.

Bashan and Carmel wither; the blossom of Lebanon languishes. 5 Mountains quake before him; the hills shake apart. The earth heaves before him— the world and all her inhabitants. 6 His indignation—who can stand before it? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; rocks are shattered before him. 7 Yahweh is good—a refuge in the day of distress; he knows those who take refuge in him. 8 But with a rushing torrent he will bring Nineveh to an end; he will chase his enemies into darkness. 9 What do you plot against Yahweh?

Micah,"1 Woe to those who plan wickedness and evil deeds upon their beds! In the light of the morning they did it, because they have power in their hands. 2 They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and they take them away. They oppress a man and his house; a man and his inheritance. 3 Therefore, thus says Yahweh: Look! I am planning disaster against this family from which you will not be able to remove your necks. You will not walk proudly, for it is a time of disaster. 4 In that day they will raise a proverb against you, and will wail a bitter wailing, saying, “We are utterly ruined; he exchanges the portion of my people. How he removes it from me; he apportions our field to an apostate.” 5 Therefore you will have no one casting a line by lot in the assembly of Yahweh. 6 “Do not preach!” they are preaching. They should not preach to these; disgrace will not overtake us. 7 Should this be said, O house of Jacob? Is the patience of Yahweh shortened? Are these his deeds? Are my words not pleasing to him who walks upright? 8 But recently my people have risen up as an enemy; from before the cloak you strip off the robe from those passing by in confidence, returning from war. 9 You have driven out the women of my people from the houses of their pleasure. From their children you have taken away my glory forever. 10 Arise and go, for this is no resting place, on account of uncleanness that destroys with painful destruction. 11 If a man walks about in a spirit of deception and lies, saying “I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,” then he would be a preacher for this people!

1 John,"1 My little children, I am writing these things to you in order that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous one, 2 and he is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. 4 The one who says “I have come to know him,” and does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in this person. 5 But whoever keeps his word, truly in this person the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in him. 6 The one who says that he resides in him ought also to walk just as that one walked. 7 Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the message which you have heard. 8 Again, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light already is shining. 9 The one who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness until now. 10 The one who loves his brother resides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him. 11 But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you on account of his name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known the One who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have conquered the evil one. 14 I have written to you, children, because you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known the One who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God resides in you, and you have conquered the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him, 16 because everything that is in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the arrogance of material possessions—is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17 And the world is passing away, and its desire, but the one who does the will of God remains forever. 18 Children, it is the last hour, and just as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen, by which we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us. But they went out, in order that it might be shown that all of them are not of us. 20 And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know. 21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because every lie is not of the truth. 22 Who is the liar except the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This person is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 As for you, what you have heard from the beginning must remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise which he himself promised us: eternal life. 26 These things I have written to you concerning the ones who are trying to deceive you. 27 And as for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not have need that anyone teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you reside in him. 28 And now, little children, remain in him, so that whenever he is revealed we may have confidence and not be put to shame before him at his coming. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness has been fathered by him.

And meanwhile Jonah went down into the hold of the vessel and lay down and fell asleep. 6 And the captain of the ship approached him and said to him, “Why are you sound asleep? Get up! Call on your god! Perhaps your god will take notice of us and we won’t perish!” 7 And they said to one another, “Come, let us cast lots so that we may know on whose account this disaster has come on us!” And they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. 8 So they said to him, “Please tell us whoever is responsible that this disaster has come upon us! What is your occupation? And from where do you come? What is your country? And from which people are you?” 9 And he said to them, “I am a Hebrew, and I fear Yahweh, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.” 10 Then the men were greatly afraid, and they said to him, “What is this you have done?” because they knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Yahweh (because he had told them).

Jonah,"11 So they said to him, “What shall we do to you so that the sea may quiet down for us?” because the sea was growing more and more tempestuous. 12 And he said to them, “Pick me up and hurl me into the sea so that the sea may quiet down for you, because I know that on account of me this great storm has come upon you all.” 13 But the men rowed hard to bring the ship back to the dry land, and they could not do so because the sea was growing more and more tempestuous against them. 14 So they cried out to Yahweh, and they said, “O Yahweh! Please do not let us perish because of this man’s life, and do not make us guilty of innocent blood, because you, O Yahweh, did what you wanted.” 15 And they picked Jonah up and hurled him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. 16 So the men feared Yahweh greatly, and they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh and made vows. 17 And Yahweh provided a large fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. 1 And Jonah prayed to Yahweh his God from the belly of the fish 2 and said, “I called from my distress to Yahweh, and he answered me; from the belly of Sheol I cried for help— you heard my voice.

Jonah,"1 And Jonah prayed to Yahweh his God from the belly of the fish 2 and said, “I called from my distress to Yahweh, and he answered me; from the belly of Sheol I cried for help— you heard my voice. 3 And you threw me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the sea currents surrounded me; all your breakers and your surging waves passed over me. 4 And I said, ‘I am banished from your sight; how will I continue to look on your holy temple?’ 5 The waters encompassed me up to my neck; the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head. 6 I went down to the foundations of the mountains; the Underworld—its bars were around me forever. But you brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh my God.

Jonah,"7 When my life was ebbing away from me, I remembered Yahweh, and my prayer came to you, to your holy temple. 8 Those who worship vain idols forsake their loyal love. 9 But I, with a voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you; I will fulfill what I have vowed. Deliverance belongs to Yahweh!” 10 And Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out on the dry land. 1 And the word of Yahweh came to Jonah a second time, saying, 2 “Get up! Go to Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim to it the message that I am telling you.” ",Jonah 2:7-3:2,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jonah-2732-102002/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2010-06-02_jonah-2732-.mp3

Jonah,"2 “Get up! Go to Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim to it the message that I am telling you.” 3 So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh according to the word of Yahweh. Now Nineveh was an extraordinarily great city—a journey of three days across. 4 And Jonah began to go into the city a journey of one day, and he cried out and said, “Forty more days and Nineveh will be demolished!” 5 And the people of Nineveh believed in God, and they proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth—from the greatest of them to the least important. 6 And the news reached the king of Nineveh, and he rose from his throne and removed his royal robe, put on sackcloth, and sat in the ashes. 7 And he had a proclamation made, and said, “In Nineveh, by a decree of the king and his nobles: “No human being or animal, no herd or flock, shall taste anything! They must not eat, and they must not drink water! 8 And the human beings and the animals must be covered with sackcloth! And they must call forcefully to God, and each must turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands. 9 Who knows? God may relent and change his mind and turn from his blazing anger so that we will not perish.” 10 And God saw their deeds—that they turned from their evil ways—and God changed his mind about the evil that he had said he would bring upon them, and he did not do it.

Jonah,"1 And this was greatly displeasing to Jonah, and he became furious. 2 And he prayed to Yahweh and said, “O Yahweh, was this not what I said while I was in my homeland? Therefore I originally fled to Tarshish, because I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and having great steadfast love, and one who relents concerning calamity. 3 And so then, Yahweh, please take my life from me, because for me death is better than life!” 4 And Yahweh said, “Is it right for you to be angry?” 5 And Jonah went out from the city and sat down east of the city, and he made for himself a shelter there. And he sat under it in the shade, waiting to see what would happen with the city. 6 And Yahweh God appointed a plant, and he made it grow up over Jonah to be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. And Jonah was very glad about the plant. 7 So God appointed a worm at daybreak the next day, and it attacked the plant, and it withered. 8 And when the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head and he grew faint. And he asked that he could die and said, “My death is better than my life!” 9 So God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?” And he said, “It is right for me to be angry enough to die!” 10 But Yahweh said, “You are troubled about the plant, for which you did not labor nor cause it to grow. It grew up in a night and it perished in a night! 11 And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, the great city, in which there are more than one hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know right from left, plus many animals?” ",Jonah 4,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jonah-4-109475/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2010-06-08_jonah-4_20100519093213.mp3

Obadiah,"1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus says my Lord Yahweh concerning Edom: We have heard a report from Yahweh, and a messenger has been sent among the nations: “Rise up and let us rise against it for battle.” 2 “Look, I will make you insignificant among the nations. You will be utterly despised! 3 The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of a rock, the heights of its dwelling, you who say in your heart: ‘Who can bring me down to the ground?’ 4 Even if you soar like the eagle, even if your nest is set among the stars, from there I will bring you down!” declares Yahweh: ",Obadiah 1-4,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/obadiah-14-101992/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcg_2010-05-19_obadiah-14-.mp3
Obadiah,"4 Even if you soar like the eagle, even if your nest is set among the stars, from there I will bring you down!” declares Yahweh: 5 “If thieves came to you, if plunderers of the night—How you have been destroyed!—would they not steal what they wanted? If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings? 6 How Esau has been pillaged; his treasures have been ransacked! 7 All of your allies have driven you up to the boundary; your confederates have deceived you and have prevailed against you. Those who eat your bread have set an ambush for you, there is no understanding of it. 8 On that day,” declares Yahweh, “will I not destroy the wise men from Edom, and understanding from the mountain of Esau? 9 And your warriors will be shattered, O Teman, so that everyone from the mountain of Esau will be cut off because of the slaughter!

You also should not have gloated over his misery on the day of his disaster, and you should not have stretched out your hands to his wealth on the day of his disaster. 14 And you should not have stood at the crossroads to cut off his fugitives and you should not have handed over his survivors on the day of distress.

Obadiah,"15 “For the day of Yahweh is near against all the nations! Just as you have done, it will be done to you. Your deeds will return on your own head. 16 For just as you have drunk on my holy mountain, all the nations will drink continually. They will drink and they will slurp, and they will be as if they had never been. 17 But on Mount Zion there will be an escape, and it will be holy, and the house of Jacob will take possession of their dispossessors. 18 And the house of Jacob will be a fire and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau stubble; and they will set them on fire and will consume them. And there will not be a survivor for the house of Esau,” for Yahweh has spoken. 19 Those of the Negev will take possession of the mountain of Esau, and those of the Shephelah will possess the land of the Philistines, and they shall take possession of the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria, and Benjamin will take possession of Gilead. 20 And the exiles of this army of the people of Israel will possess Canaan up to Zarephath, and the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will take possession of the cities of the Negev. 21 And those who have been saved will go up on Mount Zion to rule the mountain of Esau.
