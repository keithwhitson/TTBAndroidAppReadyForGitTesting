Amos,"1 Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Moab and for four I will not revoke the punishment, because he burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom. 2 So I will send a fire against Moab and it will devour the citadel fortresses of Kerioth, and Moab will die amid uproar, amid war cries and amid the sound of a horn. 3 And I will cut off the ruler from its midst and I will kill all of its officials with him,” says Yahweh. 4 Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Judah and for four I will not revoke the punishment, because they have rejected the law of Yahweh and have not kept his rules, and their lies have led them astray, after which their ancestors walked! 5 So I will send a fire against Judah and it will devour the citadel fortresses of Jerusalem. 6 Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Israel and for four I will not revoke the punishment, because they sell the righteous for money and the poor for a pair of sandals! 7 Those who trample the heads of the powerless into the dust of the ground and turn aside the way of the destitute, a man and his father have sexual relations with the same girl, so that they profane my holy name. 8 They stretch themselves out beside every altar on clothing taken in pledge and they drink wine, bought with fines imposed, in the house of their God. 9 Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, who was as tall as cedars and was as strong as the oaks.

Amos,"9 Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, who was as tall as cedars and was as strong as the oaks. I destroyed his fruit above and his roots beneath. 10 And I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and I led you in the wilderness forty years to take possession of the land of the Amorite. 11 And I raised up some of your sons to be prophets and some of your young men to be Nazirites. Is it not so, O people of Israel? This is the declaration of Yahweh! 12 But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets, saying, ‘You shall not prophesy.’ 13 Look! I am going to press you down in your place just as a utility cart full of mature stalks of grain is pressed down. 14 Flight will perish from the swift and the strong person will not muster his strength and the warrior will not save his life. 15 And the one who takes hold of the bow will not stand and the one who is swift on his feet will not save himself, nor will the one who rides the horse save his life. 16 Even those who are strong of heart among the mighty will flee away naked from the city on that day.

You built vineyards of delightfulness, but you will not drink their wine. 12 For I know your transgressions are many and your sins are numerous, you foes of the righteous, those who take a bribe, and those who push aside the poor ones in the gate! 13 Therefore, whoever has insight will keep silent in that time, for it is a time of evil. 14 Seek good and not bad in order that you may live, and so Yahweh, the God of hosts, will be with you, as you have said. 15 Hate evil and love good and establish justice in the gate; perhaps Yahweh, the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph. 16 Therefore, thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, my Lord, “In all of the public squares there will be wailing, and in all of the streets they will say, ‘Alas, alas!’ They shall call the farmers to mourning and to wailing, to those who are skilled in lamentation. 17 And in all of the vineyards there will be wailing, because I will pass in your midst,” says Yahweh.

But you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood! 13 You who rejoice over Lo-Debar, who say, “Have we not taken Karnaim for ourselves by our strength?” 14 Indeed, I am going to raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, declares Yahweh, the God of hosts. And they shall oppress you from Lebo-hamath up to the wadi of the Arabah. 1 This is what my Lord Yahweh showed me, and look, he is going to form locusts at the beginning of the sprouting of the second crop, and look, after the mowings of the king. 2 And then when they finished eating the vegetation of the land, I said, “O Lord Yahweh, please forgive! How can Jacob stand, because he is small?” 3 Yahweh relented concerning this. “It will not be,” said Yahweh. 4 This is what my Lord Yahweh showed me, and look, my Lord Yahweh was going to call for a legal case with fire, and it devoured the great deep and it ate up the plots of ground. 5 Then I said, “O Lord Yahweh, please stop! How can Jacob stand, because he is small?” 6 Yahweh also relented concerning this. “This also will not be,” said my Lord Yahweh. 7 This is what he showed me: Behold, my Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plummet, and a plummet was in his hand. 8 And Yahweh said to me, “What do you see, Amos?” And I said, “A plummet.” And my Lord said, “Look, I am going to set a plummet in the midst of my people, Israel. I will not pass them by again. 9 The high places of Isaac shall become desolate and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste. And I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.” 10 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam the king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to endure all of his words. 11 For this Amos has said, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly go into exile away from his land.’ ” 12 And Amaziah said to Amos, “O seer, go, flee to the land of Judah and earn food there and prophesy there!” 13 But do not prophesy again at Bethel, because this is a sanctuary of a king and this is a temple of a kingdom.” 14 And Amos answered and said to Amaziah, “I am not a prophet and I am not a son of a prophet, but I am a herdsman and I am one taking care of sycamore trees. 15 And Yahweh took me from following behind the sheep and goats and Yahweh said to me, “Go, prophesy to my people Israel!

However, I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” declares Yahweh. 9 “Yes, look, I am going to command and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations like one who shakes with a sieve, but not a pebble will fall to the ground. 10 All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, ‘Evil will not overtake or confront us.’ 11 On that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen, and I will repair its breaches and will raise up its ruins and will build it like the days of old. 12 Thus they may take possession of the remnant of Edom and all the nations who are called by my name,” declares Yahweh, who does this. 13 “Look, days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “when the one who plows will overtake the one who reaps, the one who treads grapes will catch up with the one who sows the seed. And the mountains will drip sweet wine and all of the hills will flow with it. 14 And I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel, and they will rebuild the desolated cities and will inhabit them.

1 Peter,"11 Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and temporary residents to abstain from fleshly desires which wage war against your soul, 12 maintaining your good conduct among the Gentiles, so that in the things in which they slander you as evildoers, by seeing your good deeds they may glorify God on the day of visitation. 13 Subject yourselves to every human authority for the sake of the Lord, whether to a king as having supreme authority, 14 or to governors as those sent out by him for the punishment of those who do evil and the praise of those who do good. 15 For the will of God is as follows: by doing good to silence the ignorance of foolish people. 16 Live as free persons, and not using your freedom as a covering for evil, but as slaves of God. 17 Honor all people, love the community of believers, fear God, honor the king. 18 Domestic slaves, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unjust. 19 For this finds favor, if because of consciousness of God someone endures sorrows while suffering unjustly. 20 For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if you endure when you do good and suffer for it, this finds favor with God. 21 For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his footsteps, 22 who did not commit sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth, 23 who when he was reviled, did not revile in return; when suffering, he did not threaten, but entrusted himself to the one who judges justly, 24 who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we may die to sins and live to righteousness, by whose wounds you were healed. 25 For you were going astray like sheep, but you have turned back now to the shepherd and guardian of your souls. 1 In the same way, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some are disobedient to the word, they may be won over without a word by the conduct of their wives, ",1 Peter 2:11-3:1,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-peter-21131-98276/direct-download/tbd20100326.mp3

1 Peter,"8 And finally, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, showing mutual affection, compassionate, humble, 9 not repaying evil for evil or insult for insult, but on the other hand blessing others, because for this reason you were called, so that you could inherit a blessing. 10 For “The one who wants to love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips must not speak deceit. 11 And he must turn away from evil and do good; he must seek peace and pursue it. 12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil. 13 And who is the one who will harm you if you are a zealous adherent for what is good? 14 But even if you might suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. And do not be afraid of their intimidation or be disturbed, 15 but set Christ apart as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense to anyone who asks you for an accounting concerning the hope that is in you. 16 But do so with courtesy and respect, having a good conscience, so that in the things in which you are slandered, the ones who malign your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame. 17 For it is better to suffer for doing good, if God wills it, than for doing evil. 18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, in order that he could bring you to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, 19 in which also he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, 20 who were formerly disobedient, when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, while an ark was being constructed, in which a few—that is, eight souls—were rescued through water. 21 And also, corresponding to this, baptism now saves you, not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22 who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, with angels and authorities and powers having been subjected to him.

Therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for your prayers. 8 Above all, keep your love for one another constant, because love covers a large number of sins. 9 Be hospitable to one another without complaining. 10 Just as each one has received a gift, use it for serving one another, as good stewards of the varied grace of God. 11 If anyone speaks, let it be as the oracles of God; if anyone serves, let it be as by the strength that God provides, so that in all things God will be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power forever and ever.

But if it begins out from us first, what will be the outcome for those who are disobedient to the gospel of God? 18 And if the righteous are saved with difficulty, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner? 19 So then also those who suffer according to the will of God must entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing good.

And let them say, “Take pity, Yahweh, on your people. Do not make your inheritance a reproach, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the nations, ‘Where is their God?’ ” 18 Then Yahweh became jealous for his land and took pity on his people. 19 And Yahweh answered and said to his people, “Look at me, I am sending to you grain, new wine, and olive oil, and you will be satisfied by it.

Are you repaying to me what is deserved? If you are recompensing me, I will return swiftly and quickly what you deserve on your head! 5 For you have taken my silver and my gold, and my beautiful treasures you have carried into your temples. 6 And the sons of Judah and Jerusalem you sold to the sons of the Greeks, in order to remove them from their border. 7 Look! I am rousing them from the place where you have sold them, and I will return what you deserve on your head! 8 I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans and to a nation far away, for Yahweh has spoken. 9 Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare for war! Stir up the mighty warriors; let them approach and come up; let all the men of war approach. 10 Beat your cutting tools of iron into swords and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weakling say, ‘I am a mighty warrior!’ 11 Hurry and come, all the nations, from all around, and gather yourselves there. Bring down your mighty warriors, O Yahweh! 12 Let the nations be roused and let them come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat, for there I will sit to judge all the nations from all around. 13 Send forth the sickle, for the harvest is ripe! Go tread, for the winepress is full! The vats overflow, because their evil is great! 14 Commotion, commotion in the valley of decision!

And Jerusalem will be a place of holiness, and strangers will pass through it no longer. 18 And it will happen on that day; the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will flow with milk, and all the channels of Judah will flow with water. A spring from the house of Yahweh will come forth, and it will water the valley of Acacia Trees. 19 Egypt will become a desolation, and Edom will become a desolate desert, because of the violence they did against the children of Judah, in whose land they have shed innocent blood. 20 But Judah will be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem for all generations. 21 I will cleanse their bloodguilt that I did not cleanse, for Yahweh is dwelling in Zion.

Let her put away her whoring from before her, and her adultery from between her breasts. 3 Lest I strip her naked and expose her like the day when she was born; I will make her like the desert and turn her into parched land; I will kill her with thirst. 4 And I will not have pity on her children, because they are children of whoredom. 5 Because their mother was unfaithful; she who conceived them has acted shamefully, for she said: “I will go after my lovers, the ones who give me my bread, my water, my wool, and my flax, my oil, and my drink.” 6 Therefore, Look! I am going to hedge her path with thorns, and I will build a stone wall, a stone wall against her, and she will not find her paths. 7 Then she will pursue her lovers, but she will not overtake them; she will seek them and not find them; and she will say, “I will go and return to my first husband because it was better for me then than now.” 8 But she did not know that it was I who gave her grain, new wine, and oil, and who gave her silver in abundance, and gold which they made into a Baal. 9 Therefore I will take again my grain in its time, and my wine in its season; and I will take away my wool and my flax, which were to cover her nakedness. 10 And now I will uncover her nakedness before the eyes of her lovers, and no one will rescue her from my hand. 11 And I will put an end to all her mirth, her festivals, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her appointed festivals; 12 and I will lay waste to her vines and her fig trees, of which she said, “They are my payment for prostitution, which my lovers gave to me.” I will make them a forest, and the wild animals of the field will devour them. 13 I will punish her for the days of the Baals, to whom she burns incense, and she decked herself with her ornamental ring and jewelry, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me —a declaration of Yahweh. 14 Therefore, Look! I am going to allure her and bring her into the desert, and I will speak tenderly to her. 15 From there I will give her her vineyards, and the Valley of Achor as a doorway of hope. And there she will respond, as in the days of her youth, just as in the day of her coming out of the land of Egypt. 16 And on that day— a declaration of Yahweh— you will call me, “My husband;” you will no longer call me, “My Baal.” ",Hosea 2:1-16,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/hosea-21-16-87151/direct-download/tbd20100125.mp3
Hosea,"15 From there I will give her her vineyards, and the Valley of Achor as a doorway of hope. And there she will respond, as in the days of her youth, just as in the day of her coming out of the land of Egypt. 16 And on that day— a declaration of Yahweh— you will call me, “My husband;” you will no longer call me, “My Baal.” 17 I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they will no longer be mentioned by their name. 18 I will make a covenant for them on that day, with the animals of the field, with the birds of the heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; the bow, the sword, and the war I will abolish from the land, and I will let them lie down in safety. 19 And I will take you as my wife forever; I will take you as a wife for myself in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy. 20 I will take you as my wife in faithfulness, and you will know Yahweh. 21 On that day I will answer, declares Yahweh, I will answer the heavens, and they will answer the earth. 22 And the earth will answer the grain, the wine, and the oil, and they will answer Jezreel. 23 I will sow her for myself in the land; I will have pity on Lo-ruhama; I will say to Lo-ammi, “You are my people,” and he himself will say, “you are my God.” 1 And Yahweh said to me again, “Go, love a woman who has a lover and is committing adultery, just like the love of Yahweh for the children of Israel, but they are turning to other gods and love raisin cakes.” 2 So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer of barely and a measure of wine. 3 And I said to her, “You must remain as mine for many days, and you will not play the whore; you will not belong to a man, and I will belong to you.” 4 The children of Israel will remain for many days without a king and prince, without sacrifice and stone pillar, ephod and teraphim.

Hosea,"6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from acting as a priest for me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children. 7 When they became many, their sin increased against me; they changed their glory into shame. 8 They feed on the sin of my people, they are greedy for their iniquity. 9 And it will be like people, like priest; I will punish them for their ways, and I will requite them for their deeds. 10 They will eat and not be satisfied; they will play the whore and not multiply, because they have forsaken Yahweh to devote themselves to 11 whoredom. Wine and new wine take away the understanding. 12 My people, consult their wooden idols, and their divining rod gives them oracles; because a spirit of whoredom led them astray, and they played the whore from under their God. 13 On the tops of the mountains they sacrifice, and on the hills they make offerings, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because their shade is good. Therefore your daughters play the whore, and all your daughters-in-law commit adultery. 14 I will not punish your daughters when they play the whore, or your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery; because they go aside with whores, and they sacrifice with temple prostitutes, a people that does not understand comes to ruin. 15 Even though you, O Israel, are playing the whore, do not let Judah become guilty; do not enter Gilgal, or go up to Beth-aven; and do not swear, “As Yahweh lives!” 16 Indeed, like a stubborn heifer, Israel is stubborn; Now Yahweh will feed them, like a lamb in broad pasture. 17 Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone. 18 When their drinking has ended, they surely indulge in sexual orgies. They love lewdness more than their glory. 19 A wind has wrapped them in its wings, and they will be ashamed because of their altars.

Hosea,"1 Hear this, O priests! Give heed, O house of Israel! Listen, O house of the king! Because the judgment applies to you; because you have been a snare for Mizpah, and a net spread out on Tabor; 2 they dug a deep pit in Shittim, but I am a punishment for all of them. 3 I myself know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; because now you have played the whore, O Ephraim— Israel is defiled. 4 Their deeds do not permit them to return them to God. Because a spirit of whoredom is in their midst, they do not know Yahweh. 5 The pride of Israel testifies against him, and Israel and Ephraim stumble in their guilt, and Judah stumbles with them. 6 With their flocks and herds they will go to seek Yahweh, but they will not find him; he has withdrawn from them. 7 They have dealt faithlessly with Yahweh because they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them with their fields. 8 Blow the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah. Sound the alarm in Beth-aven; look behind you, Benjamin. 9 Ephraim will be a desolation in the day of punishment; among the tribes of Israel I will reveal what is true. 10 The princes of Judah have become like those who remove a landmark; on them I will pour out my wrath like water. 11 Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, because he was determined to go after filth. 12 But I am like a maggot to Ephraim and like rottenness to the house of Judah. 13 And when Ephraim saw his illness, and Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria, he sent to the great king. But he was unable to cure you and heal your wound. 14 Because I will be like a lion to Ephraim and like a fierce strong lion to the house of Judah.

He will come like the showers to us, like the spring rain that waters the earth. 4 What will I do with you, O Ephraim? What will I do with you, O Judah? Your love is like a morning cloud, like the dew that goes away early in the morning. 5 Therefore, I have hewn them by the prophets; I have killed them by the words of my mouth, and my judgment goes forth like the light. 6 Because I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, and knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings. 7 But like Adam, they transgressed the covenant; there they dealt faithlessly with me. 8 Gilead is a city of evil, a cunning city because of blood. 9 Like bandits lying in wait, so is a band of priests; they murder on the road to Shechem; indeed, they commit a monstrous crime. 10 In the house of Israel I have seen something horrible; Ephraim’s unfaithfulness is there.

Hosea,"1 when I would heal Israel, and the corruption of Ephraim is revealed, and the wicked deeds of Samaria; because they deal in falsehood, the thief breaks in, and the bandit raids the outside. 2 But they did not consider that I remember all their wickedness. Now their deeds surround them; they are before my face. 3 By their wickedness they make the king glad, and the officials by their treacheries. 4 All of them commit adultery, like a burning oven whose baker has stopped from stirring the fire, and from kneading the dough until it is leavened. 5 On the day of our king, the princes became sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with mockers. 6 Because they are kindled like an oven, their heart burns within them; all night their anger smolders, in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire. 7 All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings have fallen; there is none who calls to me amongst them. 8 Ephraim mixes himself with the nations; Ephraim is a bread cake not turned over. 9 Foreigners devour his strength, and he does not know it; mold is also sprinkled upon him, and he does not know it. 10 The pride of Israel testifies against him— they do not return to Yahweh their God; they do not seek him for all of this. 11 Ephraim was like a dove, silly, without sense; they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. 12 Just as they go, I will cast my net over them; I will bring them down like the birds of the heavens; I will discipline them according to a report to their assembly. 13 Woe to them, because they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, because they have rebelled against me! I myself would redeem them, but they speak lies against me. 14 They do not cry out to me from their heart, but they wail on their beds; because of grain and new wine they lacerate themselves; they depart from me. 15 And I myself trained and strengthened their arms; but they plan evil against me. 16 They turn, not to the Most High, like a slack bow; their officials will fall by the sword because of the anger of their tongue.

Hosea,"1 Put to your lips the trumpet like a vulture over the house of Yahweh, because they have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law. 2 They cry out to me, “My God! We, Israel, know you!” 3 Israel has spurned the good; the enemy will pursue him. 4 They appointed kings, but not through me; they made officials, but without my knowledge. With their silver and gold they made idols for themselves for their own destruction. 5 Your calf is rejected, O Samaria; my anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence? 6 Because it is from Israel, an artisan made it, it is not a god; for the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces. 7 Because they sow the wind, they will reap the whirlwind. The standing grain does not have heads; it will not yield flour. And if it would yield, strangers would devour it. 8 Israel is swallowed up; now they are among the nations, like an object that no one desires. 9 For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild donkey alone to itself; Ephraim has sold itself for lovers. 10 Even though they have sold themselves to the nations, now I will gather them. They will soon writhe from the burden of kings and princes. 11 When Ephraim multiplied altars to expiate sins, they became to him altars to sin on. 12 I write for him myriads of my instruction; they are regarded as a strange thing. 13 They offer sacrifices of my choice and they eat flesh; Yahweh does not accept them. Now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins; they will return to Egypt. 14 Israel has forgotten his maker and built palaces, and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; but I will send fire on his cities and it will devour her strongholds. 1 Do not rejoice, O Israel, do not exult like the nations! For you played the whore, departing from your God; you loved a harlot’s wage on all the threshing floors of grain. 2 Threshing floor and wine vat will not feed them, and new wine will fail her. 3 They will not remain in the land of Yahweh. But Ephraim will return to Egypt, and in Assyria they will eat unclean food. 4 They will not pour drink offerings of wine to Yahweh, and their sacrifices will not please him. They are like mourners’ bread for them; all those who eat it will be defiled. For their bread will be for their hunger; it will not come to the house of Yahweh. 5 What will you do on the day of the appointed time, and on the day of the festival of Yahweh? 6 For look! If they flee from the destruction, Egypt will gather them; Memphis will bury them. Nettles will possess their precious things of silver; thorns will be in their tents.

Because of the greatness of your sin, your hostility is great. 8 The prophet keeps watch over Ephraim for my God; the snare of a fowler is on all his ways, and hostility in the house of his God. 9 They deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah; he will remember their sin, he will punish their sins. 10 Like the grapes in the wilderness, I found Israel. Like early ripened fruit on the fig tree in the first season, I saw your ancestors. They themselves came to Baal Peor, and they consecrated themselves to shame. And they became detestable things, like the thing they love. 11 Ephraim’s glory is like a bird; it will fly away— no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception. 12 Even though they bring up their children, I will bereave them before maturity. Woe to them indeed, when I depart from them! 13 Ephraim, as I see it, is like a palm in a meadow; but Ephraim must bring out his children to the slayer. 14 Give them, O Yahweh— what will you give them? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. 15 Every evil of theirs began at Gilgal, so I began to hate them there; because of the evil of their deeds I will drive them out from my house. I will love them no more; all their officials are rebels. 16 Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, they shall not bear fruit. Even if they give birth, I will kill the cherished offspring of their womb. 17 My God will reject them because they did not listen to him, and they will be wanderers among the nations. 1 Israel is a luxuriant vine; he yields fruit for himself.

The more his land prospered, the more he improved his stone pillars. 2 Their heart is false; now they must bear their guilt. He himself will break down their altars; he will destroy their stone pillars. 3 For now they will say, “We have no king; indeed, we did not fear Yahweh, and what can a king do for us?” 4 They utter words of vain oaths when making covenants, and judgment blossoms like a poisonous plant on the furrows of the field. 5 The inhabitants of Samaria tremble for the calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, his people will mourn for it, and his idolatrous priests will wail over it— over its glory because it has departed from it. 6 It will also be brought to Assyria, as tribute to the great king. Ephraim will obtain disgrace and Israel will be ashamed from his advice. 7 Samaria will be destroyed; her king is like a chip on the surface of the water. 8 The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed. Thorn and thistle will grow on their altars. They will say to the mountains, “Cover us,” and to the hills, “Fall on us.” 9 From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel; there they have remained. Will not war in Gibeah overtake them against the children of evil? 10 In my desire I will punish them; nations will be gathered against them when they are punished for their double iniquities. 11 Ephraim was a trained heifer, that loved to thresh grain, and I myself spared the fairness of her neck; I will make Ephraim break the ground, Judah will plow, Jacob must till for himself. 12 Sow for yourselves righteousness; reap loyal love. Break up for yourself fallow ground; it is time to seek Yahweh so he will come and rain righteousness upon you. 13 You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped injustice, you have eaten the fruit of lies, because you have trusted in your strength, in the multitude of your warriors. 14 The tumult of war will rise up against your people, and all your fortresses will be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel; on the day of war mothers were dashed to pieces with their children. 15 So it will be done to you, O Bethel, because of the evil of your wickedness; at dawn, the king of Israel will be utterly destroyed. 1 When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.

Hosea,"1 When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. 2 When I called them, they went from my face. They sacrificed to the Baals, and they sacrificed to idols. 3 And I myself taught Ephraim to walk; I took them in my arms, but they did not know that I healed them. 4 I drew them with human ties, with the bands of love. I was to them like one who lifted up a yoke on their jaws, though I bent down to them and let them eat. 5 He will return to the land of Egypt, and Assyria will be his king, because they refused to return. 6 The sword rages in his cities; it consumes his false prophets and devours because of their plans. 7 My people are bent on backsliding from me. To the Most High they call, he does not raise them at all. 8 How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is disturbed within me; all my compassions are aroused. 9 I will not execute my fierce anger, I will not again destroy Ephraim; because I am God and not a mortal, the Holy One in your midst; and I will not come in wrath. 10 They will go after Yahweh; he roars like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the sea. 11 They will tremble like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria; and I will let them return to their homes— a declaration of Yahweh. 12 Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; and Judah is still wandering with God and is faithful to the Holy One. 1 Ephraim herds the wind and is pursuing the east wind all day long; he multiplies deception and violence and he makes a treaty with Assyria, and oil is brought to Egypt. 2 Yahweh has a quarrel with Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds. 3 In the womb he deceived his brother, and in his manhood he struggled with God. 4 He struggled with the angel and prevailed; he pleaded for his mercy. He met him at Bethel, and there he spoke with him. 5 Yahweh the God of hosts, Yahweh is his renowned name! 6 But you, you must return to your God; keep love and justice, and wait continually for your God. 7 The trader, in his hand are scales of deceit; he loves to oppress. 8 And Ephraim said, “Surely, I am rich, I gained wealth for myself; in all my toil they have not found guilt in me that is sin. 9 But I am Yahweh your God since the land of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, like the days of the appointed festival. 10 I spoke to the prophets; I myself multiplied revelations and through the hand of the prophets I will destroy. 11 If in Gilead there is evil, surely they will come to nothing. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, also their altars will be like stone heaps on furrows of the field. 12 Jacob fled to the open field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he watched over sheep. 13 And by a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up from Egypt, and by a prophet he was watched over. 14 Ephraim has caused bitter provocation, and his Lord will hold him responsible for his crimes and pay back to him his insults. 1 When Ephraim spoke, there was terror; he was exalted in Israel, but he incurred guilt through Baal and died. 2 And now they sin again, and they make for themselves a molten idol, idols from their silver metal according to their understanding, all of them the work of skilled craftsmen. To these they say, “Sacrifice!” People are kissing bull calves. 3 Therefore, they will be like the morning cloud, and like the dew of early morning going away, like chaff swirling from the threshing floor, or like smoke from a window. 4 I am Yahweh your God since the land of Egypt; you know no god except me, and no one saves besides me. 5 I fed you in the desert, in the land of drought. 6 When I fed them, they were satisfied; they were satisfied and their heart was lifted up; therefore they forgot me. 7 And I will be like a lion to them; I lie in wait beside the way, like a leopard. 8 I will attack them like a bear robbed of her offspring, and I will tear open the covering of their heart; there I will devour them like a lion, like an animal of the field would mutilate them. 9 I will destroy you, O Israel; who will help you? 10 Where now is your king that he may save you? Where in all your cities are your judges, of whom you said, “Give to me a king and rulers?” 11 I gave you a king in my anger, and I took him in my wrath. 12 The sin of Ephraim is wrapped up; his sin is concealed. 13 The labor pains of childbirth come for him; he is an unwise son because at the proper time, he does not present himself at the mouth of the womb. 14 Should I redeem them from the power of Sheol? Should I deliver them from death? Where are your plagues, O Death? Where is your destruction, O Sheol? Compassion is hidden from my eyes. 15 Although he may flourish among reeds, the east wind will come, a wind of Yahweh rising from the desert; his fountain will dry up, his spring will be parched. It will plunder his treasury, every object of desire. 16 Samaria will be guilty, because she has rebelled against her God; they will fall by the sword, their children will be dashed to pieces, and their pregnant women will be ripped open. 1 Return to Yahweh your God, O Israel, for you have stumbled because of your sin. 2 Take words with you, and return to Yahweh. Say to him, “Take away all guilt; accept good, and we will offer the fruit of our lips. 3 Assyria will not save us; we will not ride on horses, and we will say no more, “Our God,” to the work of our hands because in you the fatherless child finds mercy. 4 I will heal their disloyalty; I will love them freely because my anger has turned back from them. 5 I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like the lily plant, and he will strike his roots like the trees of Lebanon. 6 His new plant shoots will spread out; his splendor will be like the olive tree, and his scent like the trees of Lebanon. 7 They will again dwell in my shadow; they will grow grain and they will blossom like the plant vine; his fame will be like the wine of Lebanon. 8 O Ephraim, what have I to do with idols? I myself have answered and looked after you. I am like a luxuriant cypress; your fruit comes from me. 9 Who is wise that he can understand these things? Who is discerning that he knows them? The ways of Yahweh are right, and the righteous walk in them; but transgressors stumble in them.

When he had made purification for sins through him, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 4 having become by so much better than the angels, by as much as he has inherited a more excellent name than theirs. 5 For to which of the angels did he ever say, “You are my son, today I have begotten you,” and again, “I will be his father, and he will be my son”? 6 And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, “And let all the angels of God worship him.” 7 And concerning the angels he says, “The one who makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire,” ",Hebrews 1:3-7,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/hebrews-137-69141/direct-download/tbd20091125.mp3
Hebrews,"8 but concerning the Son, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of righteous is the scepter of your kingdom. 9 You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; because of this God, your God, has anointed you with the olive oil of joy more than your companions. 10 And, “You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the works of your hands; 11 they will perish, but you continue, and they will all become old like a garment, 12 and like a robe you will roll them up, and like a garment they will be changed; but you are the same, and your years will not run out.” 13 But to which of the angels has he ever said, “Sit down at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.” 14 Are they not all spirits engaged in special service, sent on assignment for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation? 1 Because of this, it is all the more necessary that we pay attention to the things we have heard, lest we drift away. 2 For if the word spoken through angels was binding and every transgression and act of disobedience received a just penalty, 3 how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation which had its beginning when it was spoken through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard, 4 while God was testifying at the same time by signs and wonders and various miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will.

For in subjecting all things, he left nothing that was not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him, 9 but we see Jesus, for a short time made lower than the angels, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that apart from God he might taste death on behalf of everyone. 10 For it was fitting for him for whom are all things and through whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory to perfect the originator of their salvation through sufferings.

Hebrews,"1 Therefore, holy brothers, sharers in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession, 2 who was faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses also was in his household. 3 For this one is considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, inasmuch as the one who builds it has greater honor than the house. 4 For every house is built by someone, but the one who built all things is God. 5 And Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony to the things that would be spoken, 6 but Christ was faithful as a son over his house, whose house we are, if we hold fast to our confidence and the hope we can be proud of.

Hebrews,"16 For who, when they heard it, were disobedient? Surely it was not all who went out from Egypt through Moses? 17 And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness? 18 And to whom did he swear they would not enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient? 19 And so we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief. 1 Therefore let us fear, while there remains a promise of entering into his rest, that none of you appear to fall short of it. 2 For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as those also did, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united with those who heard it in faith. 3 For we who have believed enter into rest, just as he has said, “As I swore in my anger, ‘They will never enter into my rest.’ ” And yet these works have been accomplished from the foundation of the world. 4 For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,” 5 and in this passage again, ‘They will never enter into my rest.’ ” 6 Since therefore it remains for some to enter into it, and the ones to whom the good news was proclaimed previously did not enter because of disobedience, 7 again he ordains a certain day, today, speaking by David after so long a time, just as had been said before, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.” 8 For if Joshua had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken about another day after these things.

Hebrews,"1 For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of people in the things relating to God, in order that he can offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins, 2 being able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and led astray, since he himself also is surrounded by weakness, 3 and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins for himself also, as well as for the people. 4 And someone does not take for himself the honor, but is called by God, just as Aaron also was. 5 Thus also Christ did not glorify himself to become high priest, but the one who said to him, “You are my Son, today I have begotten you,” 6 just as also in another place he says, “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek,” 7 who in the days of his flesh offered up both prayers and supplications, with loud crying and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard as a result of his reverence.

Hebrews,"2 to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything—in the first place, his name is translated “king of righteousness,” and then also “king of Salem,” that is, “king of peace”; 3 without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God—he remains a priest for all time. 4 But see how great this man was, to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth from the spoils! 5 And indeed those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have a commandment to collect a tenth from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, although they are descended from Abraham. 6 But the one who did not trace his descent from them collected tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. 7 Now without any dispute the inferior is blessed by the more prominent. 8 And in this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case it is testified that he lives. 9 And, so to speak, even Levi, the one who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham. 10 For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him. 11 Thus if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people received the law, what further need is there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not said to be according to the order of Aaron? 12 For when the priesthood changes, of necessity there is a change of the law also. 13 For the one about whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe from which no one has officiated at the altar. 14 For it is evident that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses said nothing concerning priests. 15 And it is still more clear, if another priest according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises, 16 who has become a priest not according to a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life. 17 For it is testified, “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.” 18 For on the one hand a preceding commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness 19 (for the law made nothing perfect), but on the other hand there is the introduction of a better hope through which we draw near to God.

Through the greater and more perfect tent not made by hands, that is, not of this creation, 12 and not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered once for all into the most holy place, obtaining eternal redemption. 13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled sanctify them for the ritual purity of the flesh, 14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve the living God? 15 And because of this, he is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that, because a death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions committed during the first covenant, those who are the called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. 16 For where there is a will, it is a necessity for the death of the one who made the will to be established. 17 For a will is in force concerning those who are dead, since it is never in force when the one who made the will is alive. 18 Therefore not even the first covenant was ratified without blood. 19 For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people, 20 saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you.” 21 And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the utensils of service with the blood. 22 Indeed, nearly everything is purified with blood according to the law, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. 23 Therefore it was necessary for the sketches of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these. 24 For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf, ",Hebrews 9:2-24,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/hebrews-9224-87129/direct-download/tbd20091224.mp3

God is dealing with you as sons.

Amen. 22 Now I urge you, brothers, bear with my word of exhortation, for indeed I have written to you briefly. 23 Know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I will see you, if he comes quickly enough. 24 Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you. 25 Grace be with all of you.

Daniel,"2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim the king of Judah into his hand and some of of the utensils of the temple of God, and he brought them to the land of Shinar to the temple of his gods, and he brought the utensils to the treasury of his gods. 3 And the king ordered Ashpenaz, the commander of his court officials, to bring some of the Israelites from the royal family and from the lords, 4 youths who have no physical defect, and who are handsome, and who are prudent in all wisdom and endowed with knowledge, and who understand insight, and who have the ability in them to serve in the palace of the king. And the king ordered him to teach them the literature and the language of the Chaldeans. 5 And the king assigned to them his daily portion from the fine food of the king, and from the wine that he drank, and instructed that they were to be educated for three years. And at the end of their training, they were to be stationed before the king. 6 Now there was among them from the Judeans, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. 7 And the commander of the court officials gave them names, and he called Daniel, Belteshazzar; and Hananiah, Shadrach; and Mishael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego. 8 Now Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the fine food of the king, and with the wine that he drank, and so he requested from the commander of the court officials permission so that he would not defile himself. 9 And God gave Daniel favor and compassion before the commander of the court officials, 10 and the commander of the court officials said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord, the king, who has determined your food and your drink, for why should he see your face having a worse appearance than the young men who are your age? Then you will endanger my head with the king.” 11 Then Daniel asked the guard whom the commander of the court officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 12 “Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us some of the vegetables, and let us eat and let us drink water. 13 Then let our appearances and the appearance of the young men who are eating the fine food of the king be compared before you, and then deal with your servants according to what you see.” ",Daniel 1:2-13,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/daniel-1213-69109/direct-download/tbd20091012.mp3
Daniel,"14 So he agreed to this proposal with them, and he tested them for ten days. 15 And at the end of ten days their appearances appeared better and they were healthier of body than all the young men who were eating the fine food of the king. 16 So the guard continued to withhold their fine food and the wine of their drink, and he gave them vegetables. 17 And as for these four young men, God gave to them knowledge and insight into all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had insight into all visions and dreams. 18 And at the end of the time the king had set to bring them, the commander of the court officials brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 19 And the king spoke with them, and among all of them no one was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; then they stood before the king. 20 And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired from them, he found them ten times better than all of the magicians and conjurers that were in his entire kingdom. 21 And Daniel was there until the first year of Cyrus the king. 1 Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.

Daniel,"2 So the king said to call the magicians and the conjurers and the sorcerers and the astrologers to tell to the king his dreams. And they came in and they stood before the king. 3 And the king said to them, “I have had a dream and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.” 4 And the astrologers said to the king in Aramaic, “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants and we will reveal the explanation.” 5 The king answered and said to the astrologers, “The command from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its explanation, then you will be broken into pieces and your houses will be laid in ruins. 6 But if you tell me the dream and its explanation, you will receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me. Therefore, tell me the dream and its explanation.” 7 They answered once more and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants and we will make the explanation known.” 8 The king answered and said, “Certainly I know that you are trying to gain time because you have seen that this matter is firmly decreed by me, 9 for if you do not make the dream known to me, your verdict is fixed, and you have conspired to say a lying and deceitful word to me until the circumstances will change. Therefore, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can tell me its explanation.” 10 The astrologers answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth that is able to reveal the word of the king; in fact, no great and powerful king has ever asked a thing like this of any magician or conjurer or astrologer. 11 And the thing that the king is asking is too difficult and there is no one who can reveal it to the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with mortals.” 12 Because of this the king became angry, and he became very much enraged, and he said that all the wise men of Babylon are to be destroyed. 13 And the decree was issued, and the wise men were on the verge of being executed, and they searched for Daniel and his companions to be executed. 14 Then Daniel responded prudently and discretely to Arioch, the commander of the imperial guard of the king, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon. 15 He asked and said to Arioch, the royal official of the king, “Why is the decree from the king so severe?” Then Arioch explained the matter to Daniel. 16 And Daniel went in and requested from the king that he would give him time, and he would tell the king the explanation. 17 Then Daniel went to his home, and he made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, his companions, 18 and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions, along with the remainder of the wise men of Babylon, would not be killed. 19 Then in a vision of the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel; then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 20 Daniel said: “Let his name, the name of God, be blessed throughout the ages, for the wisdom and the power are his. 21 And he changes the times and the seasons, and he deposes kings and he sets up kings; he gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men who know understanding. 22 He reveals the deep and the hidden things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him. 23 To you, O God of my ancestors, I give thanks and I give praises, for the wisdom and the power you gave to me, and now you have made known to me what we have asked from you, for you have made known to us the matter of the king.” ",Daniel 2:2-23,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/daniel-2223-69111/direct-download/tbd20091014.mp3
Daniel,"24 Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and thus he said to him: “You must not destroy the wise men of Babylon; take me in before the king and I will give the explanation to the king.” 25 Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel in before the king and thus he said to him: “I have found a man among the exiles of Judah who can relate the explanation to the king.” 26 The king then asked and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its explanation?” 27 Daniel answered the king and said, “The mystery that the king asks, no wise men, conjurers, magicians, or diviners are able to make known to the king. 28 But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what it is that will be at the end of days. This is your dream and the visions of your head on your bed. 29 “As for you, king, your thoughts on your bed turned to what it was that would be in the future, and the revealer of mysteries has made known to you what that would be. 30 And as for me, it is not because of wisdom that is in me more than any other living person that this mystery is revealed to me, but in order that the explanation may be made known to the king and you will understand the thoughts of your mind. 31 “You, O king, were looking and, look, there was one great statue. This statue was huge and its brilliance extraordinary, standing there before you, and its appearance was frightening. 32 The head of this statue was of fine gold, its chest and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze, 33 its legs of iron, its feet, part of them of iron and part of them of clay. 34 You were looking on until a stone was chiseled out—that not by hands—and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and it broke them in pieces. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold all at once broke into pieces and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floor, and the wind carried them away and any trace of them could not be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and it filled the whole earth. 36 “This was the dream, and now we will tell its interpretation to the king. 37 You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power and the might and the glory, 38 and also human beings wherever they dwell, the animals of the field and the birds of heaven—he has given into your hand and made you ruler over all of them—you are the head of gold. 39 And after you another kingdom inferior to yours will arise, and another third kingdom of bronze that will rule over the whole earth.

Daniel,"40 And a fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, and just as iron crushes and smashes everything, and as iron shatters all of these other metals, so it will crush and it will shatter these nations. 41 And just as you saw the feet and the toes, partly potter’s clay and partly iron, it will be a divided kingdom; and some hardness of the iron will be in it, just as you have seen the iron mixed with the wet clay. 42 And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so part of the kingdom will be strong and partly brittle. 43 And in that you saw the iron was mixed with wet clay, so they will mix in marriage and they will not cling to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. 44 And in the day of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, and the kingdom will not be left for another nation, and it will bring an end to all these kingdoms, but it will stand forever.

Daniel,"44 And in the day of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, and the kingdom will not be left for another nation, and it will bring an end to all these kingdoms, but it will stand forever. 45 Inasmuch as you saw that a stone from the mountain was chiseled out but not by hands, and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, thereby the great God made known to the king what will be in the future, and the dream is certain and its explanation trustworthy.” 46 Then the king, Nebuchadnezzar, fell on his face and he paid homage to Daniel; and he commanded them to offer a grain offering and incense offering to him. 47 The king answered Daniel and said, “Truly your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings, and he reveals mysteries, for you are able to reveal this mystery.” 48 Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. 49 And Daniel made a request from the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained in the court of the king. 1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made a statue of gold. Its height was sixty cubits and its width was six cubits; he set it up in the valley of Dura in the province of Babylon. 2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent directions to assemble the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all of the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

Daniel,"3 Then the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the province were assembled for the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up, and were standing before the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 4 Then the herald proclaimed aloud, “To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations and people of all languages, 5 that at the time that you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the harp, the drum and all kinds of music, you must fall down and you must worship the statue of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up. 6 And whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown immediately into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.” 7 Therefore, at that time, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the harp and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations and people of all languages were falling down and were worshiping the statue of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 8 Therefore at this time some astrologers came forward and they denounced the Jews. 9 They responded and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, “O king, may you live forever! 10 You, O king, have made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the harp and the drum and all kinds of music, he shall fall down and shall worship the statue of gold. 11 And whoever does not fall down and worship shall be thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire. 12 However there are Judean men whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—these men, O king, pay you no heed and were not serving your god, and the statue of gold that you set up they are not worshiping.” 13 Then Nebuchadnezzar said in rage and anger to bring in Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego; then they brought in these men before the king. 14 Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you are not serving my god, and you are not worshiping the statue of gold that I have set up? 15 Now if you are ready so that when you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the harp and the drum and all kinds of music, you fall down and you worship the statue that I have made, that will be good. But if you do not worship it, immediately you will be thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire, and who is the god who will rescue you from my hands?” 16 Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king, Nebuchadnezzar, “We have no need on this matter to present a defense to you.

Daniel,"17 If it is so, our God, whom we serve, is able to rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire. And from your hand, O king, let him rescue us. 18 And if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, and the statue of gold that you have set up we will not worship.” 19 Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with anger and the image of his face was changed toward Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, so he ordered and said to heat up the one furnace seven times what was usual to heat it up. 20 And he commanded the strongest men of the guards who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire. 21 Then these men were bound with their garments, their trousers and their turbans and their other clothing, and they were thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire. 22 Therefore because the word of the king was severe and the furnace was exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed these men who lifted up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. 23 But these men, the three of them, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, fell down into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire, and they were bound. 24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and he rose up in haste and he asked, saying to his advisers, “Did we not throw three men, bound, into the midst of the fire? They answered, saying to the king, “Certainly, O king!” 25 He answered, saying, “Look, I see four men unbound walking in the midst of the fire and there is no damage to them, and the appearance of the fourth man resembles the son of a god.” 26 Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire, and he called out, saying, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out and come here!” 27 And the satraps, the prefects, the governors and the advisors of the king were assembling, and they saw these men, that the fire had no power over their bodies, and the hair of their heads was not singed, and their garments were not harmed, and the smell of fire did not come from them. 28 Nebuchadnezzar responded, saying, “Blessed be their God, the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who sent his angel and rescued his servants who trusted in him, and the command of the king they disobeyed, and they gave their bodies so that they did not serve and did not worship any god except their God. 29 And from me is set forth a decree that any people, nation, or language that may utter criticism against their God—the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego—will be broken into pieces and their house will be made like ruins. For there is not another God who is able to rescue like this God.” 30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.

Now tell me the visions of my dream that I saw, and its explanation. 10 Now these were the visions of my head as I was lying on my bed: I was gazing and, look, a tree was in the midst of the earth, and its height was exalted.  ----  17 The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the decision by the command of the holy ones, in order that the living will know that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdom of humankind, and to whomever he wills he gives it, and he even sets the humblest of men over it.” ","Daniel 4:1-10, 17",http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/daniel-4110-17-69117/direct-download/tbd20091022.mp3
Daniel,"10 Now these were the visions of my head as I was lying on my bed: I was gazing and, look, a tree was in the midst of the earth, and its height was exalted. 11 The tree grew and it became strong, and its height reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth. 12 Its foliage was beautiful, and its fruit abundant, and in it was provision for all. Under it the animals of the field sought shade, and in its branches the birds of heaven nested, and from it all the living beings were fed. 13 “ ‘I was looking in the vision of my head as I lay on my bed, and look, a watcher, and a holy one, came down from heaven. 14 He cried aloud and so he said: “Cut down the tree and chop off its branches; shake off its foliage and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it, and the birds from its branches. 15 But the stump of its roots leave in the earth, along with a band of iron and bronze; leave it in the grass of the field. And in the dew of heaven let it be watered, and with the animals let his lot be in the grass of the earth. 16 Let his mind be changed from that of a human, and let the mind of an animal be given to him, and let seven times pass over him. 17 The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the decision by the command of the holy ones, in order that the living will know that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdom of humankind, and to whomever he wills he gives it, and he even sets the humblest of men over it.” 18 “ ‘This is the dream that I, Nebuchadnezzar the king, saw. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its explanation, for all of the wise men of my kingdom were not able to make the explanation known to me, but you are able because the spirit of holy gods is in you.’ 19 “Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was distressed for some time, and his thoughts disturbed him. The king answered and he said, ‘Belteshazzar, let the dream and its explanation not disturb you.’ Belteshazzar answered and said, ‘My lord, may the dream and its explanation be for those who hate you and for your enemies. 20 The tree that you saw, which grew and became strong and its height reached to heaven and it was visible to the end of the whole earth, 21 and its foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, and so there was provision for all in it, and the animals of the field lived under it and in its branches nest the birds of heaven, 22 —it is you, O king, who have grown great and you have grown strong, and so your greatness has increased and it has reached to heaven and your sovereignty to the end of the earth.

Daniel,"22 —it is you, O king, who have grown great and you have grown strong, and so your greatness has increased and it has reached to heaven and your sovereignty to the end of the earth. 23 And inasmuch that the king saw the watcher, a holy one coming down from heaven and he said, “Cut down the tree and destroy it, but the stump of its root in the earth leave with a band of iron and bronze in the grass of the field, and let it be watered with the dew of heaven and let his lot be with the animals of the field until seven times have passed over him.” 24 This is the explanation, O king, and it is a decree of the Most High that has come upon my lord the king: 25 you will be driven away from human society and you will dwell with the animals of the field, and you will be caused to graze grass like the oxen yourself, and you will be watered with the dew of heaven, and seven periods of time will pass over you until that you have acknowledged that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdom of humankind, and to whom he wills he gives it. 26 And in that they said to leave alone the stump of the tree’s root, so your kingdom will be restored for you when you acknowledge that heaven is sovereign. 27 Therefore, O king, let my advice be acceptable to you and your sin remove with righteousness and your iniquity with having mercy on the oppressed, in case there might be a prolongation of your prosperity.’ ” 28 All this happened to Nebuchadnezzar the king. 29 At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon. 30 And the king answered and said, “Is this not the great Babylon which I have built as a royal palace by the strength of my own power, and for the glory of my own majesty?” 31 While the words were still in the mouth of the king, a voice from heaven came, saying, ‘To you, King Nebuchadnezzar, it is declared that the kingdom has departed from you, 32 and you will be driven away from human society and your dwelling will be with the animals of the field and they will cause you to graze the grass like oxen, and seven times will pass over you, until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdom of humankind and that he gives it to whom he wills.’ 33 Immediately the word was fulfilled concerning Nebuchadnezzar, and he was expelled from human society and he ate grass like oxen, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven until his hair was like the hair of an eagle and his nails grew like a bird’s claws. 34 “But at the end of that period, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and then my reason returned to me; and I blessed the Most High and the one who lives forever I praised and I honored. “For his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty, and his kingdom continues from generation to generation. 35 And all the dwellers of the earth are regarded as nothing, and he does according to his desire in the host of heaven and among the dwellers of earth, and there is not one who can hold back his hand, or ask him, ‘What are you doing?’ 36 “At that time my reason returned to me, and also the glory of my kingdom and my majesty and splendor returned to me, and my advisers and my lords searched me out, and I was established over my kingdom and abundant greatness was added to me. 37 Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor the king of heaven, for all his works are truth, and his ways are justice and that he is able to humble those who walk in pride.” ",Daniel 4:22-37,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/daniel-42237-69119/direct-download/tbd20091026.mp3
Daniel,"1 Belshazzar the king made a great festival for a thousand of his lords, and in the presence of the thousand lords he was drinking wine. 2 When he tasted the wine, Belshazzar commanded that they bring the vessels of gold and silver that Nebuchadnezzar his predecessor had taken from the temple that was in Jerusalem, so that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines may drink from them. 3 Then they brought in the vessels of gold that they took from the temple, the house of God that was in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines drank from them. 4 They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood and stone. 5 Immediately human fingers appeared and they wrote opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the palace of the king, and the king was watching the palm of the hand that was writing. 6 Then his face changed and his thoughts terrified him, and his hip joints gave way and his knees knocked together. 7 The king cried aloud to bring in the conjurers, the astrologers and the diviners; the king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, “Any man that can read this writing and can tell me its explanation will be clothed in purple and will have a necklace of gold hung around his neck and he will rule as third in authority in the kingdom.” 8 Then all the wise men of the king came in, but they were not able to read the writing or to make known its explanation. 9 Then the king, Belshazzar, became greatly terrified, and his facial features changed upon him, and his lords were perplexed. 10 Because of the words of the king and his lords, the queen came into the banqueting hall and the queen spoke up and said, “O king, live forever, and let not your thoughts terrify you and do not let your facial expressions grow pale. 11 There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. And in the days of your predecessor, enlightenment and insight and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in him; and, O king, Nebuchadnezzar your predecessor appointed him as chief of the magicians, the conjurers, the astrologers, and the diviners. Your predecessor the king did this 12 because there was found in him an excellent spirit and understanding and insight for interpreting dreams and explaining riddles and solving riddles; that is, in Daniel whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now, let Daniel be called and he will tell the explanation.” 13 Then Daniel was brought in before the king, and the king spoke and said to Daniel, “You are Daniel who are one of the exiles of Judah whom my predecessor, the king, brought from Judah. 14 And I have heard that a spirit of the gods is in you and enlightenment and insight and excellent wisdom was found in you. 15 And now the wise men and the conjurers were brought in before me so that they could read this writing in order to make its explanation known to me, but they were not able to disclose the explanation of the matter. 16 But I have heard concerning you that you are able to produce interpretations and to solve riddles; now if you are able to read the writing and to make known its explanation to me, you will be clothed in purple and a necklace of gold will be placed around your neck and you will rule as third in command in the kingdom.” 17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, “Let your gifts be for yourself or your rewards give to another; nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and I will make known to him the explanation. 18 O king, the Most High God gave the kingdom and the greatness and the glory and the majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your predecessor. 19 And because of the greatness that he gave to him, all the peoples, the nations and languages trembled and feared before him; whomever he wanted he killed, and whomever he wanted he let live, and whomever he wanted he honored, and whomever he wanted he humbled.

Daniel,"20 But when his heart became arrogant and his spirit became hard so as to act proudly, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom and the glory was taken away from him. 21 And he was driven away from human society and his mind was made like the animals and his dwelling was with the wild asses; and he was given grass like oxen to eat, and with the dew of heaven his body was bathed, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdom of humankind, and whoever he wants he sets over it. 22 “But you his successor, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart even though you knew all this. 23 And now you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven, and the vessels of his temple you have brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines, have been drinking wine from them, and you have praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone that do not see and do not hear and do not know, but the God who holds your life in his hand and all of your ways come from him, you have not honored. 24 So then the palm of the hand was sent out from his presence and this writing was inscribed. 25 “Now this was the writing that was inscribed: ‘Mene, Mene, Tekel and Parsin.’ 26 “This is the explanation of the matter: ‘Mene’—God has numbered your kingdom and brought an end to it. 27 “ ‘Tekel’—you have been weighed on scales and you have been found wanting. 28 “ ‘Peres’—your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.’ ” 29 Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple and placed a necklace of gold around his neck, and they made a proclamation concerning him that he would be the third ruler in authority in the kingdom. 30 That same night Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was killed. 31 And Darius the Mede received the kingdom when he was about sixty-two years old.

Daniel,"1 It pleased Darius, and he set up one hundred and twenty satraps over the kingdom, that they were throughout the whole kingdom, 2 and over them were three administrators, of whom Daniel was one, so that these satraps were giving account to them, and the king would not be suffering loss. 3 Then Daniel began distinguishing himself above the administrators and the satraps because an exceptional spirit was in him, and so the king planned to appoint him over the whole kingdom. 4 Then the other administrators and satraps began to seek to find a pretext against Daniel in connection with the kingdom, but they were not able to find any pretext and corruption because he was trustworthy, and no negligence or corruption could be found in him. 5 Then these men said, “We will not find any pretext against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.” 6 So the administrators and the satraps conspired with respect to the king and so they said to him, “Darius, O king, live forever! 7 All of the administrators of the kingdom, and the prefects, the satraps, the counselors and the governors took counsel and have agreed to establish an edict of the king and to enforce a decree that whoever will seek a prayer from any god or human except from you for up to thirty days will be thrown into the lion pit. 8 Now, O king, establish the edict and you must sign the document so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians which cannot be revoked.” 9 So the king, Darius, signed the writing and the interdict. 10 Now when Daniel realized that the document was signed, he went to his house (now he had windows in his upper room that were open toward Jerusalem), and three times daily he knelt on his knees and prayed and gave praise before his God, just as he had been doing previously. 11 Then these men came as a group and they found Daniel praying and pleading for mercy before his God. 12 Then they approached and spoke with the king concerning the edict of the king, “Did you not sign an edict that any person who would seek anything from any God or human within thirty days except from you, O king, would be thrown into the lion pit?” The king answered and said, “The matter as you have just stated is certain according to the law of the Medes and Persians which cannot be revoked.” 13 Then they responded and said before the king, “Daniel, who is from the exiles of Judah, is not paying any attention to you, O king, or to the decree that you have signed, and three times daily he says his prayer.” 14 Then the king, when he heard that report, he was extremely distressed over it; and concerning Daniel he was determined to rescue him. And until the setting of the sun he was making every effort to deliver him. 15 Then these men came as a group to the king and said, “Recall, O king, that with respect to the law of the Medes and Persians that any decree or edict that the king establishes cannot be changed.” 16 Then the king gave the command, and Daniel was brought in and they threw him into the lion pit. The king said to Daniel, “Your God, whom you serve faithfully, may he rescue you!” 17 And a stone was brought and it was put on the entrance of the pit, and the king sealed it with his signet ring and with the signet rings of his lords, so that nothing would be changed concerning Daniel. 18 Then the king went to his palace and spent the night in fasting, and no food was brought in before him and his sleep fled from him. 19 Then the king got up at daybreak, at first light, and he went in haste to the lion pit. 20 And when he came near to the pit, he cried out to Daniel with a distressed voice, and the king spoke and said to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, your God whom you serve faithfully, was he able to rescue you from the lions?” 21 Then Daniel spoke to the king, “O king, live forever! 22 My God sent his angel and he shut the mouth of the lions and they did not hurt me, because before him I was found blameless, and also before you, O king, I have not done any wrong.” 23 Then the king was exceedingly glad over it and commanded that Daniel be lifted up from the pit; and there was not any wound found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

Daniel,"1 In the third year of the kingdom of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that appeared to me previously. 2 And I saw in the vision, and when I saw, I was in Susa, the citadel that was in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I myself was at the stream of Ulai. 3 And I lifted up my eyes and I saw, and look! A ram standing before the stream, and it had two horns, and the horns were long, but the one was longer than the second, and the longer one came up after the other one. 4 I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward, and none of the beasts stood before it, and there was no rescuing from its power, and it did what it wanted and it became strong. 5 And I was considering this, and look, a he-goat coming from the west across the face of the whole earth, and it was not touching the ground; and the he-goat had a conspicuous horn between its eyes. 6 Then it came toward the ram that had the two horns that I saw standing before the stream, and it ran at it with the rage of its power. 7 And I saw it approaching the ram and it was furious at it, and it struck the ram, and it broke its two horns, and there was not strength in the ram to stand before him, and he threw it down to the ground and trampled it, and there was no one who could rescue the ram from its power. 8 And the he-goat grew exceedingly great, and at the height of its power the great horn was broken, and four conspicuous horns came up in place of it toward the four winds of heaven. 9 And from one of them came forth a horn, a little one, and it grew exceedingly toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beautiful land. 10 And it grew up to the host of heaven, and it threw down to the ground some of the host and some of the stars and trampled them. 11 Even against the prince of the hosts it acted arrogantly and took away from him the regular burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown. 12 And on account of transgression, the host was given over to the horn in addition to the regular burnt offering. And it cast down truth to the ground, and it acted, and it had success. 13 And I heard a certain holy one speaking, and a certain other holy one said to the specific one who was speaking, “For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, and the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and the host to trampling?” ",Daniel 8:1-13,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/daniel-8113-69128/direct-download/tbd20091106.mp3
Daniel,"13 And I heard a certain holy one speaking, and a certain other holy one said to the specific one who was speaking, “For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, and the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and the host to trampling?” 14 And he said to me, “For two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings, then the sanctuary will be restored.” 15 And then when I, Daniel, saw the vision, and I was seeking understanding, there was one standing before me with the appearance of a man. 16 And I heard the voice of a human at the Ulai, and he called and said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.” 17 And he came beside where I was standing, and when he came I became terrified and I fell prostrate on my face. And he said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.” 18 And when he spoke with me I fell into a trance with my face to the ground, and he touched me and made me stand on by feet. 19 And he said, “Look, I am making known to you what will happen in the period of wrath, for it refers to the appointed time of the end. 20 “The ram that you saw who had two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia. 21 “And the hairy he-goat is the kingdom of Greece, and the great horn that is between his eyes—he is the first king. 22 And the horn that was broken, and then there arose four horns in place of it—these are four kingdoms that will arise from his nation, but not with his power. 23 And at the end of their kingdom, when the transgressions are completed, a king will arise, fierce in countenance and skilled in riddles. 24 And his power will grow, but not by his own power, and he will cause fearful destruction, and he will succeed and he will act, and he will destroy the mighty and the people of the holy ones. 25 And by his planning he will make a success of deceit by his hand, and in his mind he will boast, and in their ease he will destroy many, and even against the prince of princes he will rise up, and he will be broken, but not by human hands. 26 And the vision of the evening and the morning that has been described, it is true; and you, seal up the vision, for it refers to many days to come.” 27 And I, Daniel, was overcome, and I became ill for some days, and I performed the business of the king, and I was dismayed over the vision and I did not understand it.

Daniel,"1 In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, from the offspring of the Medes, who became king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans— 2 in the first year of his kingship I, Daniel, observed in the scrolls the number of the years that it was that were to be fulfilled according to the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah the prophet for the devastation of Jerusalem—seventy years. 3 Then I turned my face to the Lord God to seek him by prayer and pleas for mercy, in fasting and in sackcloth and ashes. 4 And I prayed to Yahweh my God, and I made confession and I said, “O Lord, the great and awesome God, keeping the covenant and loyal love with those who love him and with those who keep his commandments, 5 we have sinned and we have done wrong and we acted wickedly and we rebelled and have been turning aside from your commandments and from your ordinances. 6 We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our ancestors and to all the people of the land. 7 “Righteousness belongs to you, O Lord, and on us is open shame, just as it is this day to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all Israel, those who are near and those who are far off in all the lands to which you have driven them, because of their infidelity which they displayed against you. 8 Yahweh, on us is open shame, on our kings, on our princes, and on our ancestors, because we have sinned against you. 9 Compassion and forgiveness belong to the Lord, our God, for we have rebelled against him, 10 and we have not listened to the voice of Yahweh our God, by following his law which he placed before us by the hand of his servants the prophets. 11 “And all Israel transgressed your law and turned aside so as not to listen to your voice, and so the curse and the oath which was written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, has been poured out upon us, because we have sinned against him. 12 And so he has carried out his words which he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled us, to bring upon us a great calamity which was not done under all of heaven as it was done in Jerusalem. 13 Just as it is written in the law of Moses, all of this calamity has come upon us, and we have not implored the face of Yahweh our God so as to turn from our iniquities and to attend closely to your faithfulness. 14 So Yahweh has kept watch over the calamity, and now he has brought it upon us. Indeed, Yahweh our God is righteous concerning all his works that he has done, but we have not listened to his voice. 15 “And now, Lord our God, who have brought your people out from the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and you have made for yourself a name until this day—we have sinned, we have acted wickedly. 16 Lord, according to all your righteousness, please let your anger and your rage turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain, because through our sins and through the iniquities of our ancestors Jerusalem and your people have become an object of mockery among all of our neighbors. 17 “And now, listen to the prayer of your servant and to his pleas for mercy. Shine your face upon your desolate sanctuary for your sake, O Lord. 18 Incline your ear, my God, and listen; open your eyes and look at our desolation and the city that is called by your name, for we are not presenting our pleas for mercy before you because of our righteousness, but rather because of your great compassion. 19 Lord, listen!

Peace be to you; be strong and be courageous!” And when he spoke with me, I was strengthened and I said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.” 20 Then he asked, “Do you know why I have come to you?

Daniel,"1 “And I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood as a support and as a protection for him. 2 And now I will reveal the truth to you. Look! Still three kings will arise in Persia, and the fourth will get abundance and great wealth, even more than all of them, and when he becomes strong through his wealth, then he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Javan. 3 And a mighty king will arise, and he will rule with great dominion, and he will do as he pleases. 4 But as he rises in power, his kingdom will be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, and not according to his dominion by which he ruled, for his kingdom will be uprooted and be given to others besides them. 5 “Then the king of the south will grow strong and also one of his officials, and he will grow stronger than him and he will rule a dominion greater than his dominion. 6 And at the end of some years they will make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make a peace treaty, but she will not retain her position of power, and his offspring will not endure, and she will be given up, she and her attendants and her child supporting her, in those times. 7 And a branch from her roots will rise up in his place, and he will come against the army and he will enter the stronghold of the king of the north and he will take action against them and he will prevail. 8 And also their gods with their idols and with the precious vessels, silver and gold he will take to Egypt into captivity, and for years he will leave the king of the north alone. 9 And then he will come into the kingdom of the king of the south, but he will return to his land. 10 “But his sons will wage war and they will gather a multitude of great forces and he will advance with great force, and he will overflow like a flood and he will pass through and he will return, and they will wage war up to his fortress. 11 And the king of the south will become furious, and he will go and he will battle against him, against the king of the north; and he will muster a great multitude, and the multitude will be given into his hand. 12 When the multitude is carried off, his heart will be exalted and he will overthrow tens of thousands, but he will not prevail. 13 And the king of the north will again raise a multitude, greater than the former, and at the end of some years he will surely come with a great army and with great supplies. 14 “And in these times many will rise up against the king of the south, and the violent ones of your people will lift themselves to fulfill the vision, but they will fall.

Daniel,"15 And the king of the north will come, and he will throw up siege ramps and capture a city of fortifications and the military forces of the south and his choice troops will not stand, for there is no strength left to resist. 16 And the one coming to him will act according to his pleasure, and there is no one who will stand before him, and he will stand in the beautiful land and complete destruction will be in his power. 17 And he will set his face to come with the authority of his whole kingdom and will form an agreement; and he will act, and the daughter of women he will give to him to destroy it, but the ploy will not succeed and she will not support him. 18 And he will turn his face to the coastlands, and he will capture many, but a commander will end his insults to him so that instead his insults will turn back upon him. 19 And he will turn back his face toward the strongholds of his land, but he will stumble and he will fall and will not be found. 20 “Then in his place will arise one sending an official throughout the glory of his kingdom, and in a few days he will be broken, but not in anger and not in battle. 21 And in his place a despicable person will arise on whom they have not conferred the majesty of the kingdom, and he will come in without warning and he will seize the kingdom by deceit. 22 And before him mighty military forces will be utterly swept away, and they will be broken, and also the leader of the covenant. 23 And after an alliance is made with him, he will act deceitfully, and he will rise and he will become powerful with few people backing him. 24 In a time of ease and in the rich parts of the province, he will come and he will do what his predecessors did not do; he will distribute plunder and spoil and possessions to them, and he will devise his plans against fortifications, but only for a time. 25 And he will stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south and with a much greater and stronger army; but he will not succeed, for they will devise plans against him. 26 And those who eat of his royal rations will break him and his army will be overwhelmed, and many will fall, slain. 27 And two of the kings will bend their hearts to evil. And at the same table they will speak lies, but what is discussed will not succeed, for still an end is coming at the appointed time. 28 Then he will return to his land with many possessions, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant, and he will take action and he will return to his land. 29 “At the appointed time he will return and he will come into the south, but it will not be as it was before. 30 And the ships of Kittim will come against him, and he will lose heart, and he will turn back, and he will be enraged against the holy covenant, and he will take action, and he will turn back, and he will pay attention to those who forsake the holy covenant. 31 And military forces from him will occupy and will profane the sanctuary stronghold, and they will abolish the regular burnt offering, and they will set up the abomination that causes desolation. 32 “And those who violate the covenant he will seduce with flattery, but the persons who know their God will stand firm and will take action. 33 And those who have insight will instruct the many, but they will fall by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder for some time. 34 And when they fall they will receive little help, and many will join with them in hypocrisy. 35 And even some of those who have insight will fall in order for them to be refined by it, and to be purified and cleansed until the time of the end, for the appointed time is still to come. 36 “Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt himself and will consider himself above any god, and he will speak horrendous things against the God of gods, yet he will succeed until the period of anger is finished, for what is determined will be done.

Daniel,"37 He will not pay respect to the gods of his ancestors, or to the darling of women, and not to any god will he pay respect, for he will consider himself great over all gods. 38 But instead he will honor the god of fortresses, a god whom his ancestors did not know. He will honor him with gold, and with silver, and with precious stones and with costly gifts. 39 And he will deal with the fortified strongholds with the help of a foreign god; and he will increase wealth for whoever will acknowledge him, and he will cause them to rule over the many, and he will distribute land for a price. 40 “And at the time of the end the king of the south will attack him, and the king of the north will storm against him with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships, and he will advance against the countries and he will sweep through like a flood. 41 And he will come into the beautiful land and many will fall victim, but these will escape from his power: Edom and Moab and the best part of the Ammonites. 42 And he will stretch out his hand against countries and the land of Egypt will not escape. 43 And he will rule over the treasures of gold and the silver and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Cushites will follow in his footsteps. 44 But reports will terrify him from the east and from the north, and he will go out with great fury to destroy and to exterminate many. 45 And then he will pitch the tents of his palace between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain, and he will come to his end, and there is no one helping him.” ",Daniel 11:37-45,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/daniel-113745-69136/direct-download/tbd20091118.mp3
Daniel,"1 “Now at that time, Michael, the great prince, will arise, the protector over the sons of your people, and it will be a time of distress that has not been since your people have been a nation until that time. And at that time your people will escape, everyone who is found written in the scroll. 2 And many from those sleeping in the dusty ground will awake, some to everlasting life and some to disgrace and everlasting contempt. 3 But the ones having insight will shine like the brightness of the expanse, and the ones providing justice for the many will be like the stars forever and ever. 4 But you, Daniel, keep the words secret and seal the scroll until the time of the end; many will run back and forth and knowledge will increase.” 5 Then I looked, I myself, Daniel, and look, there were two others standing: one on this bank of the stream and one on the other. 6 Then he said to the man who was clothed in linen who was above the water of the stream, “How long until the end of the wonders?” 7 And I heard the man who was clothed in linen who was above the water of the stream, and he raised his right hand and his left hand to heaven and he swore by the one who lives forever that an appointed time, appointed times, and half an appointed time would pass when the shattering of the power of the holy people would be completed; then all these things will be accomplished. 8 Now I myself heard, but I did not understand, and I said, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these things?” 9 And he said, “Go, Daniel, for the words are secret and are sealed up until the time of the end. 10 Many will be purified and will be cleansed and will be refined, but the wicked will act wickedly and none of the wicked will understand, but those who have insight will understand. 11 And from the time the regular burnt offering is removed and the abomination that causes desolation is set up there will be one thousand two hundred and ninety days. 12 Happy is the one who is persevering, and attains to the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days. 13 But you, go on to the end and rest, and you will arise for your allotted inheritance at the end of the days.” ",Daniel 12,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/daniel-12-69137/direct-download/tbd20091119.mp3
Philemon,"1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker, 2 and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house. 3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 4 I thank my God, always making mention of you in my prayers, 5 because I hear about your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints. 6 I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing that is in us for Christ. 7 For I have great joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. 8 Therefore, although I have great confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper, 9 instead I appeal to you because of love, since I am such a one as Paul, now an old man and also a prisoner of Christ Jesus. 10 I am appealing to you concerning my child whom I became the father of during my imprisonment, Onesimus. 11 Once he was useless to you, but now he is useful to you and to me, 12 whom I have sent back to you himself, that is, my heart, 13 whom I wanted to keep with me, in order that he might serve me on behalf of you during my imprisonment for the gospel. 14 But apart from your consent, I wanted to do nothing, in order that your good deed might be not as according to necessity, but according to your own free will. 15 For perhaps because of this, he was separated from you for a time, in order that you might have him back forever, 16 no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 17 If therefore you consider me a partner, receive him as you would me. 18 But if in anything he has caused you loss or owes you anything, charge this to my account. 19 I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will pay it back, lest I mention to you that you owe me even your very self besides. 20 Yes, brother, I ought to have some benefit of you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. 21 Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you because I know that you will do even beyond what I say. 22 At the same time also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. 23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 24 and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. 25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. 5 On account of this, I left you behind in Crete, in order that what remains may be set in order and you may appoint elders in every town, as I ordered you. 6 If anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of dissipation or rebellious. 7 For it is necessary for the overseer to be blameless as God’s steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain, ",Titus 1:1-7,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/titus-117-69103/direct-download/tbd20091002.mp3
Titus,"8 but hospitable, loving what is good, prudent, just, devout, self-controlled, 9 holding fast to the faithful message according to the teaching, in order that he may be able both to exhort with sound instruction and to reprove those who speak against it. 10 For there are many rebellious people, idle talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, 11 whom it is necessary to silence, whoever are ruining whole families by teaching things which must not be taught for the sake of dishonest gain. 12 A certain one of them, one of their own prophets, has said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” 13 This testimony is true, for which reason reprove them severely, in order that they may be sound in the faith, 14 not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of people who turn away from the truth. 15 To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and conscience are defiled. 16 They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny him, because they are detestable and disobedient, and unfit for every good deed. 1 But you, speak the things which are fitting for sound instruction.

Titus,"1 But you, speak the things which are fitting for sound instruction. 2 Older men are to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in endurance. 3 Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, 4 in order that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands and to love their children, 5 to be self-controlled, pure, busy at home, good, being subject to their own husbands, in order that the word of God may not be slandered. 6 Likewise, exhort the young men to be self-controlled, 7 concerning everything showing yourself to be an example of good deeds, in your teaching demonstrating soundness, dignity, 8 a sound message beyond reproach, in order that an opponent may be put to shame, because he has nothing bad to say concerning us. 9 Slaves must be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not to talk back, 10 not stealing, but demonstrating all good faith, in order that they may do credit to the teaching of God our Savior in everything. 11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people, 12 training us in order that, denying impiety and worldly desires, we may live self-controlled and righteously and godly in the present age, 13 looking forward to the blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 14 who gave himself for us, in order that he might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good deeds. 15 Speak these things and exhort and reprove with all authority.

Titus,"1 Remind them to be subject to the rulers and to the authorities, to obey, to be prepared for every good work, 2 to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all courtesy to all people. 3 For we also were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, enslaved to various desires and pleasures, spending our lives in wickedness and envy, despicable, hating one another. 4 But when the kindness and love for mankind of God our Savior appeared, 5 he saved us, not by deeds of righteousness that we have done, but because of his mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit, 6 whom he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 8 The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist concerning these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and beneficial for people. 9 But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and contentions and quarrels about the law, for they are useless and fruitless. 10 Reject a divisive person after a first and second admonition, 11 knowing that such a person is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned. 12 When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make haste to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. 13 Diligently send on their way Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, so that they may lack nothing. 14 But also our people must learn to engage in good deeds for necessary needs, so that they will not be unfruitful. 15 All those with me greet you.

Ezekiel,"4 And I looked, and look! A storm wind was coming from the north, a great cloud, and fire flashing back and forth, and brightness around and within it, and from its midst it was like the outward appearance of amber stone from the midst of the fire. 5 And from its midst was the likeness of four living creatures, and this was their appearance: a human form, 6 and each had four faces, and each of them had four wings. 7 And their legs were straight legs, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of the foot of a calf, and they were sparkling like the outward appearance of polished bronze. 8 And under their wings were human hands on their four sides. And their faces and their wings for the four of them were as follows: 9 their wings were touching one another; each of them went straight forward, without turning right or left. 10 The likeness of their faces was the face of a human in front, and the face of a lion on the right of each of them, and the face of an ox on the left of each of them, and the face of an eagle for each of them. 11 So were their faces; their wings were spread out upward; each had two touching one another and two covering their bodies. 12 And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit went they went, and they did not turn as they went. 13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. It was moving to and fro between the living creatures, and the fire was very bright and lightning was going out from the fire. 14 And the living creatures were speeding to and fro like the appearance of lightning. 15 And I saw the living creatures, and look! A wheel was on the earth beside each of the living creatures that had four faces. 16 The appearance of the wheels and their construction was like the appearance of beryl, and they all looked alike, and their appearance and their construction was like a wheel within a wheel. 17 When they moved, they went toward their four sides; they did not veer at all as they went. 18 And their rims were high and awesome, and all four of their rims were full of eyes all around. 19 And at the going of the living creatures, the wheels next to them also went, and when the creatures were lifted from the ground the wheels also rose. 20 Wherever the spirit went they would go there, and the wheels rose, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 21 At their going, they go, and at their standing, they stood, and at their being lifted up from on the earth, the wheels rose, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 22 Now the likeness above the heads of the living creatures was an expanse like the outward appearance of awesome ice spread out above their heads upward. 23 And under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight one toward the other; each had two wings covering them, and each had two wings covering their bodies. 24 And I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the voice of Shaddai, and when they moved there was a sound of tumult like the sound of an army; when they stood still they lowered their wings. 25 And there was a sound from above the expanse that was above their heads, and when they stood they lowered their wings. 26 And from above the expanse that was above their heads there was the likeness of a throne, looking like a sapphire, and above the likeness of the throne was a likeness similar to the appearance of a human on it, but above it. 27 And I saw something like the outward appearance of amber, something like the appearance of fire, with a covering around it, from the likeness of his loins and upward. And from the likeness of his loins and downward I saw something like the appearance of fire, and it was radiant all around. 28 Like the appearance of a bow that is in the cloud on a rainy day, such was the radiance around it; thus was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh. And I saw, and I fell on my face, and I heard a voice speaking.

Ezekiel,"1 And he said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, so that I can speak with you.” 2 And the Spirit came into me as he was speaking to me, and it set me on my feet, and I heard the one speaking to me. 3 And he said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to nations who are rebelling, who rebelled against me, they and their ancestors, they transgressed against me until this very day. 4 And the children are impudent and stubborn, and so I am sending you to them, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh!’ 5 And they, whether they listen or whether they fail to listen, for they are a rebellious house, they will know that a prophet was in their midst. 6 And you, son of man, you must not be afraid of them, and you must not be afraid of their words, because briers and thorns are with you, and you are sitting among scorpions. You must not be afraid of their words, and you must not be dismayed because of their looks, for they are a rebellious house. 7 And you must speak my words to them whether they listen or whether they fail to listen, for they are rebellious. 8 And you, son of man, hear what I am speaking to you: you must not be rebellious like the house of rebellion. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving to you.” 9 And I looked, and look! There was a hand stretched out to me, and look! In it was a scroll with writing. 10 And he rolled it out before me, and it was written on the front and back, and there were written on it laments and mourning and wailing. 1 And he said to me, “Son of man, what you find, eat! Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.” 2 And I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat, 3 and he said to me, “Son of man, you must give your stomach this to eat, and you must fill your belly with this scroll that I am giving to you.” And I ate, and it became like sweet honey in my mouth. 4 And he said to me, “Son of man, come! Go to the house of Israel, and you must speak to them with my words. 5 For you are sent to the house of Israel, not to a people of obscure speech and of a difficult language, 6 and not to many nations of obscure speech and a difficult language whose words you do not understand, for if I had sent you to them they would have listened to you. 7 And the house of Israel, they are not willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me, for all of the house of Israel is hard of forehead, and they are hard of heart. 8 But look, I have made your face hard against their faces and your forehead hard against their forehead. 9 Like a diamond harder than flint I have made your forehead; you must not fear them, and you must not be dismayed on account of them, for they are a rebellious house. 10 And he said to me, “Son of man, all of my words that I shall speak to you, receive into your heart and hear with your ears. 11 And come, go to the exiles, to the children of your people, and you must speak to them, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh!’ whether they listen or whether they fail to listen.” 12 And the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake when the glory of Yahweh rose from its place. 13 And it was the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching lightly one against the other, and the sound of the wheels beside them and the sound of a great earthquake. 14 And the Spirit lifted me and took me, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me. 15 And I went to the exiles at Tel Abib, who were dwelling near the Kebar River, and I sat where they were dwelling. I sat there seven days in the midst of them, stunned. 16 And then it happened at the end of seven days, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 17 “Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, then you must warn them from me. 18 When I say to the wicked, ‘Surely you will die,’ and you do not warn him and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way so that he may live, that wicked person will die because of his guilt, and from your hand I will seek his blood. 19 And you, if you do warn the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness and from his wicked way, on account of his guilt he will die, and you yourself will have saved your life.

Ezekiel,"20 And when the righteous turns from his righteousness and does injustice, and I place a stumbling block before him, he will die, for you did not warn him. Because of his sin he will die, and his righteousness that he did will not be remembered, and his blood I shall seek from your hand. 21 And if you warn him, the righteous, not to sin, and the righteous does not sin, surely he will live, for he heeded a warning. And you will have saved your life.” 22 And the hand of Yahweh was on me there, and he said to me, “Rise up, go out to the valley, and there I will speak with you.” 23 And I rose up, and I went to the valley, and, look, there the glory of Yahweh was standing, like the glory that I saw near the Kebar River, and I fell on my face. 24 And the Spirit came into me, and it made me stand on my feet, and he spoke with me and said to me, “Come, shut yourself inside your house, 25 and you, son of man, look, they will place cords on you, and they will tie you up with them. Then you will not go out into the midst of them. 26 And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, and you will be silenced, and you will not be a reproving man for them, for they are a rebellious house. 27 And when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “The one hearing him, let him hear, and the one failing to hear, let him fail,” ’ for they are a rebellious house. 1 “Now, son of man, take for yourself a brick, and you must put it before you, and you must portray on it a city, Jerusalem. 2 And you must build against it siege works, and you must build against it a bulwark, and you must heap against it a siege ramp, and you must set up against it camps and put against it a battering ram all around. 3 And take for yourself a plate of iron, and you must place it as a wall of iron between you and the city, and you must set your face against it, and it must be under siege, and you must lay the siege against it; it is a sign for the house of Israel. 4 And you, lie down on your left side, and you must put the guilt of the house of Israel on it. You will carry their guilt the number of days that you will lie on it. 5 And I will give to you the years of their guilt according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days, and you must bear the guilt of the house of Israel. 6 When you have completed these, then you must lie a second time on your right side; and you must bear the guilt of the house of Judah forty days, a day for each year, a day for each year I give it to you. 7 And toward the siege of Jerusalem you must set your face and your bared arm; then you must prophesy against it. 8 Now look! I will put on you cords, and you may not turn yourself from one side to your other side until you complete the days of your siege. 9 “And you, take for yourself wheat and barley and beans and lentils and millet and spelt, and you must put them in one vessel, and you must make them for yourself into a food during the number of days that you are lying on your side; three hundred and ninety days you shall eat it. 10 And your food that you will eat will be according to weight; twenty shekels for each day at fixed times you shall eat it. 11 And an amount of water you shall drink, a sixth of a hin; at fixed times you shall drink it. 12 And as a bread-cake of barley you shall eat it, and with human excrement you shall bake it before their eyes.” 13 And Yahweh said, “Thus shall the Israelites eat their unclean food among the nations where I will scatter them.” 14 And I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Look! I have not been defiling myself, and a dead body and mangled carcass I have not eaten from my childhood until now, and unclean meat has not come into my mouth!” 15 And he said to me, “See I will give you cattle manure in the place of the feces of a human, and you may prepare your food on it.” 16 And he said to me, “Son of man, look, I am going to break the supply of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread by weight, anxiously, and rationed water, and they will drink with horror, 17 so that they will lack food and water, and they will be appalled with one another, and they will waste away because of their guilt. 1 “And you, son of man, take for yourself a sword, sharp as a barber’s razor. Take it for yourself, and you must cause it to pass over your head and over your beard, and you must take for yourself a set of scales for weighing, and you must divide them. 2 A third you must burn with fire in the midst of the city at the completion of the days of the siege, and you must take a third, and you must strike it with the sword around it, and a third you must scatter to the wind, and I will draw a sword behind them. 3 And you must take from these a few in number, and you must tuck them in your hem. 4 And from them again you shall take some, and you must throw them in the middle of the fire, and you must burn them with fire; from it a fire will go out to all of the house of Israel. 5 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: This is Jerusalem in the midst of the nations where I have put her, and countries are around her. 6 But she has rebelled against my regulations to the point of wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are around her; for they rejected my regulations, and as for my statutes, they did not walk in them. 7 Therefore, thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because of your commotion more than the nations that are around you—you did not walk in my statutes, and you did not do my regulations, and according to the regulations of the nations that are around you, you did not do. 8 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Look! I, even I, am against you, and I will execute judgment in the midst of you before the eyes of the nations, 9 and I will do with you that which I have not done, and which I will not do again, because of all of your detestable things. 10 Therefore parents will eat children in the midst of you, and children will eat their parents, and I will execute judgment in you, and I will scatter your entire remnant to every wind. 11 Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord Yahweh, Surely because you have defiled my sanctuary with all of your vile idols and with all of your detestable things, now indeed I will reduce, and my eye will not take pity, and surely I will show no compassion. 12 A third of you will die because of the plague, and because of the famine they will perish in the midst of you, and a third will fall through the sword around you, and a third I will scatter to every direction of the wind, and I will draw the sword behind them. 13 And my anger will come to an end, and I will place my rage on them, and I will relent, and they will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my passion when I fully vent my rage against them. 14 And I will make you into a desolate place and into a disgrace among the nations that surround you before the eyes of every one who passes by. 15 And it will be an object of taunting and an object of mockery, a warning and a horror to the nations that are around you whenever I execute judgments against you in anger and in wrath and in furious punishments! I, Yahweh, have spoken! 16 When I send my arrows of deadly famine against them, which will be as destruction that I will send in order to destroy you, I will increase famine against you, and I will break the supply of food for you. 17 And I will send against you famine and fierce animals, and they will make you childless; and plague and blood will pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I, Yahweh, I have spoken!” ",Ezekiel 3:20-5:17,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ezekiel-320-517-62596/direct-download/tbd20090901.mp3
Ezekiel,"17 And I will send against you famine and fierce animals, and they will make you childless; and plague and blood will pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I, Yahweh, I have spoken!” 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, set your face to the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them, 3 and you must say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh, thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys: “Look, I am bringing upon you the sword, and I will destroy your high places, 4 and your altars will be desolate, and your incense altars will be broken, and I will throw down your slain ones before your idols, 5 and I will place the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars. 6 In all of your dwellings, the cities will be desolate and the high places will be ruined, so that your altars will be desolate and will suffer punishment. Your idols will be broken and will come to an end, and your incense altars will be cut down, and your works will be destroyed, 7 and the slain one will fall in the midst of you, and then you will know that I am Yahweh. 8 But I will spare some, so there will be for you fugitives from the sword among the nations when you are scattered in the countries. 9 And your fugitives will remember me among the nations to which they were taken captive, that I was shattered by their adulterous heart which departed from me, and by their adulterous eyes which went after their idols, and they will feel loathing for themselves, for the evil that they did, for all of their detestable things. 10 And they will know that I am Yahweh; not in vain I spoke to bring to them this evil.” ’ 11 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Clap your hand and stamp with your foot, and say, “Alas, for all of the detestable things of the evil of the house of Israel, because of which they will fall with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague. 12 The one who is far away will die by the plague, and the one who is near will fall by the sword, and the one who is being left behind and being spared will die by the famine, and I will complete my rage on them. 13 And you will know that I am Yahweh when their slain ones are in the midst of their idols around their altars at every high hill, on the tops of all the mountains and under every green tree and under every leafy oak—the place at which they gave a pleasing scent for all of their idols. 14 And I will stretch out my hand against them, and I will make the land a desolation and a wasteland from the desert to Riblah in all of their dwellings, and they will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ ” 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “And you, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel: ‘The end comes, the end on the four corners of the land.

Ezekiel,"1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “And you, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel: ‘The end comes, the end on the four corners of the land. 3 Now the end is on you, and I will send my anger on you, and I will judge you according to your ways, and I will bring on you all your detestable things. 4 And my eye will not take pity on you, and I will not show compassion for your ways; on you I will bring your detestable things; they will be in the midst of you, and you will know that I am Yahweh.’ 5 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Look! Disaster after disaster is coming! 6 The end comes, comes the end! It has awakened against you! Look! It comes! 7 Doom is coming against you, the dweller of the land; the time comes, the day is near, panic and not joy is on the mountains. 8 Soon I will pour out my rage on you, and I will fully vent my anger on you, and I will judge you according to your ways, and I will bring on you all of your detestable things. 9 And my eye will not take pity, and I will not show compassion. According to your ways I will deal with you, and your detestable things will be in the midst of you, and you will know that I am Yahweh who strikes. 10 Look! The day is coming; doom goes out, the staff blossoms, pride sprouts. 11 Violence has grown to become a staff of wickedness; none from them will remain, and none from their abundance nor from their wealth; and prominence will not be among them. 12 The time has come, the day has arrived; let not the buyer rejoice, and let the seller not mourn, for anger is on all their multitude. 13 For the seller will not return to the merchandise while they are still alive, for the vision is about all of its multitude; it will not change, and a man because of his guilt will not be able to hold onto his life. 14 They shall blow on the trumpet and prepare everything, but there is no one going to the battle, for my anger is on all of their multitude. 15 The sword is outside, and the plague and the famine are inside; the one who is in the field will die by the sword, and the one who is in the city, famine and plague will devour him. 16 And if their survivors will escape, they will be on the mountains, like the doves of the valley, all of them groaning, each because of his guilt. 17 All of the hands will hang limp, and all of the knees will be wet with urine. 18 And they will wear sackcloth, and horror will cover them, and on all of the faces will be shame, and baldness on all of their heads. 19 Their silver they will discard on the streets, and filth will be their gold; their silver and their gold will not be able to rescue them on the day of the wrath of Yahweh. They will not satisfy their hunger and their stomachs they will not fill, for their guilt will be their stumbling block. 20 “ ‘And the beauty of its ornament he made into a prideful thing and made with it their detestable things and their vile idols; therefore I will make it into an impure thing for them. 21 And I will give it into the hand of strangers as plunder and to the wicked people of the earth as spoil, and they will defile it. 22 And I will turn my face from them, and they will defile my treasured place, and violent ones will enter and defile it. 23 Make a chain for the land; it is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence. 24 And I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will take possession of their houses, and I will put to an end the pride of the mighty ones, and their sanctuaries will be defiled. 25 Anguish comes, and they will seek peace, and there will be none. 26 Calamity upon calamity will come, and rumor will be upon rumor. And they will seek a vision from a prophet, but instruction will perish from the priest and counsel from the elders. 27 The king will mourn, and the prince will be dressed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. According to their way I will do to them, and according to their judgments I will judge them, and they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 1 And then in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me. And the hand of the Lord Yahweh fell on me there, 2 and I saw, and look! A figure like the appearance of a man; from the appearance of his waist and below was fire, and from his waist and upward was like the appearance of brightness, like the outward appearance of amber. 3 And he sent out the form of a hand, and he took me by a lock of hair of my head, and the Spirit lifted me between earth and heaven, and it brought me to Jerusalem in visions of God to the doorway of the inner gate that faced north, at which there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which was making jealous. 4 And look! There was the glory of the God of Israel like the vision that I saw in the valley.

Ezekiel,"2 and I saw, and look! A figure like the appearance of a man; from the appearance of his waist and below was fire, and from his waist and upward was like the appearance of brightness, like the outward appearance of amber. 3 And he sent out the form of a hand, and he took me by a lock of hair of my head, and the Spirit lifted me between earth and heaven, and it brought me to Jerusalem in visions of God to the doorway of the inner gate that faced north, at which there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which was making jealous. 4 And look! There was the glory of the God of Israel like the vision that I saw in the valley. 5 And he said to me, “Son of man, lift up now your eyes toward the north.” And I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and, look, there was to the north of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy at the entrance. 6 And he said to me, “Son of man, “Do you see what they are doing—great detestable things that the house of Israel is committing here so as to drive me from my sanctuary, and yet you will see again greater detestable things.” 7 And he brought me to the doorway of the courtyard, and I saw, and look! A hole in the wall. 8 And he said to me, “Son of man, dig now through the wall.” And I dug through the wall, and look! There was a doorway. 9 And he said to me, “Come and see the detestable things, the evil that they are doing here. 10 And I came, and I saw, and look, all kinds of creatures and detestable beasts; and all of the idols of the house of Israel were carved on the wall all around. 11 And seventy men from the elders of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, was standing in the midst of them, and they were standing before them. Each one had his censer in his hand, and the fragrance of the cloud of the incense was going up. 12 And he said to me, “Have you seen, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each in the inner rooms of his idol, for they are saying, ‘Yahweh is not seeing us; Yahweh has abandoned the land.’ ” 13 And he said to me, “Still you will see again greater detestable things that they are doing.” 14 And he brought me to the doorway of the gate of the house of Yahweh that is toward the north, and look! There were the women sitting weeping for Tammuz. 15 And he said to me, “Have you seen, son of man? Still you will see again greater detestable things than these.” 16 And he brought me to the inner courtyard of the house of Yahweh, and look, at the doorway of the temple of Yahweh, between the portico and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of Yahweh and their faces toward the east, and they were bowing down toward the east before the sun. 17 And he said to me, “Have you seen, son of man? Was it too small a thing for the house of Judah to do the detestable things that they did here? For they filled up the land with violence, and they provoked me to anger again, and look! They are putting the branch to their nose. 18 And so I will act in rage, and my eye will not take pity, and I will not have compassion, and they will cry in my ear with a loud voice, and I will not hear them.” 1 And he called in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “They have come near, the punishers of the city, and each with his weapon of destruction in his hand. 2 And look! Six men coming from the way of the upper gate that faced northward, and each with his weapon for shattering in his hand; and one man was in the midst of them, dressed in linen, and the writing case of the scribe was at his side. And they came and stood beside the bronze altar. 3 And the glory of the God of Israel lifted itself up from upon the cherub that he was on and went to the threshold of the house, and he called to the man who was clothed in linen with a scribal writing case at his side. 4 And Yahweh said to him, “Go through in the midst of the city, in the midst of Jerusalem, and you must place a mark on the foreheads of the men who are groaning and lamenting about all of the detestable things that are being done in the midst of her.” 5 And to the others he said in my hearing, “Go through the city behind him and kill! Your eyes shall not take pity, and you shall not have compassion. 6 You must kill totally old man, young man and young woman, and little children and women, but concerning every man with the mark on him you must not approach; and from my sanctuary you must begin.” And they began with the old men who were before the house. 7 And he said to them, “Defile the house and fill the courtyards with the dead; go out! And they went out, and they killed in the city. 8 And then as they were striking, and I was left behind, I fell on my face, and I cried out, and I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! “Will you be destroying all of the remnant of Israel while you pour out your rage on Jerusalem?” 9 And he said to me, “The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is filled with bloodguilt, and the city is full of injustice. For they say Yahweh abandoned the land, and Yahweh does not see. 10 And I, my eye will not take pity, and I will not have compassion; their way I will bring on their head.” 11 And look! The man clothed in linen and with a writing case at his side was bringing back a word, saying, “I have done all that you commanded me.” ",Ezekiel 8:2-9:11,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ezekiel-82-911-62599/direct-download/tbd20090904.mp3
Ezekiel,"1 And I looked, and look! On the expanse that was above the head of the cherubim something like a stone of sapphire, and like the appearance of the shape of a throne it appeared above them. 2 And he spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, “Go in among the wheel area under the cherubim and fill the hollow of your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim, and toss them on the city.” And he went right before my eyes. 3 Now the cherubim were standing on the south of the temple when the man went, and the cloud filled the inner courtyard. 4 And the glory of Yahweh rose up from on the cherub toward the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the courtyard was filled with the brightness of the glory of Yahweh. 5 And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer courtyard; it was like the voice of God Shaddai when he speaks. 6 And then at his command to the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from among the wheel area from among the cherubim,” he went and stood beside the wheel. 7 Then the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim toward the fire that was among the cherubim, and he lifted up and gave it into the hollow of the hand of the man clothed with linen, and he took it, and he went out. 8 And there appeared for the cherubim the form of a human hand under their wings. 9 And I saw, and look, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub, and the appearance of the wheels was like the outward appearance of turquoise stone. 10 Their appearance was the same for each of the four of them, as if the wheel was in the midst of a wheel. 11 When they went to the four of their directions that they went, they did not change direction when they went, for the place to which the head turned, they went behind him; they did not change direction at their going. 12 And their whole body, and their rims, and their spokes, and their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around—the wheels for the four of them. 13 Concerning the wheels, he was calling them “the wheelwork” in my hearing. 14 And each one had four faces; the face of the one was the face of a cherub, and the face of the second was the face of a human, and the face of the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth was the face of an eagle. 15 And the cherubim rose; that is, the living creatures that I saw at the Kebar River. 16 And when the cherubim went, the wheels beside them went; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to rise up from the earth, the wheels also did not turn aside from beside them. 17 When they stood, they stood, and at their rising, they rose with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in them. 18 And the glory of Yahweh went out from the threshold of the temple, and it stood above the cherubim. 19 And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and they rose from the earth before my eyes. At their going out, the wheels were beside them. And he stood at the doorway of the eastern gate of the temple of Yahweh, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them. 20 This was the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel at the Kebar River, and I knew that they were cherubim. 21 Each one had four faces, and there were four wings for each, and the likeness of human hands was under their wings. 22 And the likeness of their faces, they were the faces that I saw at the Kebar River; thus was their appearance, and they each went straight ahead. 1 And the Spirit lifted me up, and it brought me to the eastern gate, the one facing east, of the temple of Yahweh. And look, there were twenty-five men in the doorway of the gate, and I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur in the midst of them, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the commanders of the people. 2 And he said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise mischief, and who are offering bad counsel in this city, 3 who are saying, “The building of houses is not near; the city is the pot, and we are the flesh. 4 Therefore prophesy against them! Prophesy, son of man!” 5 And the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me, and he said to me, “Say, ‘thus says Yahweh: “This is what you think, house of Israel, and I myself know them, the thoughts of your spirit. 6 You made your slain ones numerous in this city, and you have filled its streets with slain ones.” ’ 7 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Your slain ones whom you put in its midst, they are the flesh, and it is the pot, and I will bring you out from its midst. 8 The sword you have feared, and the sword I will bring against you!” declares the Lord Yahweh. 9 “And I will bring you out from its midst, and I will give you into the hand of strangers, and I will execute judgments against you. 10 By the sword you will fall at the border of Israel; I will judge you, and you will know that I am Yahweh. 11 It will not be as a pot to you, and so you would be in the midst of it as flesh, for at the border of Israel I will judge you. 12 And you will know that I am Yahweh, whose rules you did not follow, and whose regulations you did not do, but according to the regulations of the nations that are around you, you acted.” ’ 13 And it happened that as I was prophesying, Pelatiahu the son of Benaiahu died! And I fell on my face, and I cried with a loud voice, and I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh, you are making a complete destruction of the remnant of Israel!” 14 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 15 “Son of man, your brothers, your brothers, the men of your redemption, and all of the house of Israel, all of it, who said concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, ‘They are far from Yahweh, therefore to us this land was given as a possession.’ 16 Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Though I have removed them far away among the nations and though I have scattered them among the countries, yet I was a sanctuary to them for a little while in the countries to which they have gone.’ ” 17 Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “And I will assemble you from the peoples, and I will gather you from the countries to which you were scattered among them, and I will give the land of Israel to you. 18 And when they come there, then they will remove all of its vile idols and all of its detestable things from it. 19 And I will give to them one heart, and a new spirit I will give in their inner parts. And I will remove their heart of stone from their body, and I will give to them a heart of flesh, 20 so that they may walk in my statutes, and they will keep my regulations, and they will do them, and they will be to me a people, and I myself will be to them as God. 21 But to the heart of their abominations and the detestable things their heart is going. I will bring their way on their head,” declares the Lord Yahweh.’ ” 22 Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and their wheels were beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them. 23 And the glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city, and it stood still on the mountain that is to the east of the city. 24 And the Spirit lifted me up, and it brought me to Chaldea, to the exiles, in the vision by the spirit of God; and the vision that I had seen left me. 25 And I spoke to the exiles all of the words of Yahweh that he had shown me.

Ezekiel,"1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, you are dwelling in the midst of the house of rebellion who has eyes to see and they do not see; they have ears to hear, and they do not hear, for they are a house of rebellion. 3 And you, son of man, prepare for yourself the baggage of an exile, and go into exile by day before their eyes. And you must go into exile from your place to another place before their eyes; perhaps they will see that they are a house of rebellion. 4 And you must bring out your baggage like the baggage of an exile by day before their eyes, and you must go out in the evening before their eyes like those who go into exile. 5 Before their eyes dig through for yourself, through the wall, and you must bring the baggage out through it. 6 Before their eyes, on your shoulder, you must lift up the baggage in the dusk, and your face you must cover, so that you may not see the land, for I make you as a sign to the house of Israel.” 7 And I did just as I was commanded; my baggage, like the baggage of an exile, I brought out by day, and in the evening I dug through for myself into the wall with my hand in the dusk; I brought the baggage on my shoulder; I carried it before their eyes. 8 And the word of Yahweh came to me in the morning, saying, 9 “Son of man, did not they, the house of Israel, the house of rebellion, say to you, ‘What are you doing?’ 10 Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “This oracle is about the prince in Jerusalem and the entire house of Israel who are among them.” ’ 11 Say, ‘I am your sign, and just as I did, so will it be done to them in the exile; into captivity they will go.’ 12 And the prince who is in the midst of them, on his shoulder he will carry the baggage in the dusk, and he will go out; the wall will be dug through to bring him through it; and he will cover his face so that he will not see the land with his eye. 13 And I will spread out my net on him, and he will be captured in my hunting snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and there he will die. 14 And all who are around him, his help and all of his troops I will scatter in every direction, and I will draw the sword behind them. 15 And they will know that I am Yahweh when I scatter them among the nations and I scatter them in the countries. 16 But I will spare from them a few men from the sword, from the famine and from the plague, so that they may tell of all their abominations among the nations to which they will go, and they will know that I am Yahweh.” 17 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 18 “Son of man, you must eat your food with trembling, and your water with shuddering, and with anxiety you must drink. 19 And you must say to the people of the land, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the inhabitants of Jerusalem about the land of Israel: “They will eat their food with anxiety and their water they will drink with horror, because their land will be desolate from its fullness because of all the violence of those who are dwelling in it. 20 And the inhabited cites will be desolate, and the land will be a desolation, and you will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ ” 21 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 22 “Son of man, what is this proverb you people have about the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision has come to nothing.’ 23 Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “I will put an end to this proverb, and they will not quote it as a proverb again in Israel.” ’ But say to them, ‘The days are near, and also the word of every vision.’ 24 For there will not be any longer any false vision or flattering divination in the midst of the house of Israel. 25 For I, Yahweh, I will speak what I will speak as a word, and it will be done. It will not prolong itself any longer, for in your days, house of rebellion, I will speak a word and I will fulfill it!” declares the Lord Yahweh. 26 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 27 “Son of man, look! The house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he is seeing is for many days from now, and for distant times he is prophesying.’ 28 Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “None of my words will be prolonged any longer that I speak as a word, and it will be fulfilled!” ’ ” declares the Lord Yahweh. 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, prophesy to the prophets of Israel who are prophesying, and you must say to those who are prophets out of their own imagination, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh!’ 3 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Alas, for the foolish prophets who are going after their own spirit, and they did not see anything! 4 Your prophets have been like foxes among ruins. 5 You did not go up into the breaches and repair a wall for the house of Israel to stand firm in the battle on the day of Yahweh. 6 They saw falseness and a lying divination, the ones saying, ‘Declaration of Yahweh!’ and Yahweh did not send them, and they wait for the confirmation of their word. 7 Have you not seen a false vision and spoken a lying divination, and you said, ‘Declaration of Yahweh!’ but I myself did not speak. 8 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because of your speaking falseness and because you envisioned a lie, therefore, look! I am against you!” declares the Lord Yahweh. 9 “And it will be my hand against the prophets who are seeing falseness and who are practicing lying divination. They will not be in the council of my people, and they will not be written down in the record book of the house of Israel, and into the land of Israel they will not come, and then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh. 10 Because, yes, because they led my people astray, saying ‘Peace!’ And there is not peace. And when anyone builds a flimsy wall, look, they coat it with whitewash. 11 Say to those covering it with whitewash that it will fall; there will be a torrent of rain, and I will give stones of hail; they will fall! And a windstorm will burst forth! 12 And look! When the wall falls, will it not be said to you, ‘Where is the whitewash with which you covered it?’ 13 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘And so I will let burst forth a windstorm in my rage, and there will be a torrent of rain in my anger, and hailstones in my rage for complete destruction. 14 And I will break down the wall that you covered with whitewash, and I will knock it to the ground, and its foundation will be revealed, and it will fall, and you will come to an end in the midst of it, and you will know that I am Yahweh! 15 And I will fully vent my rage against the wall and against those covering it with whitewash, and I will say to you, “The wall is no more, and the people covering it are no more, 16 that is, the prophets of Israel, the ones prophesying concerning Jerusalem and the ones seeing visions of peace, and there is not peace!’ ” ” declares the Lord Yahweh. 17 “And you, son of man, place your face toward the daughters of your people who prophesy from their imagination, and prophesy against them! 18 And you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Woe to those who sew magic charm bands on all the wrists of the hands of my people and those who make the veils that are on the head of people of every height, to ensnare people’s lives! Will you ensnare the lives of my people and keep yourselves alive? 19 And you defiled me among my people for a handful of barley and for morsels of bread to kill persons who should not die and to keep alive persons who should not live by means of your lies to my people who are listening to your lies.” ’ 20 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Look! I am against your magic charm bands with which you are ensnaring persons as birds; I will tear them from your arms, and I will release the persons that you are ensnaring, treating persons as birds. 21 And I will tear off your veils, and I will deliver my people from your hand, and they will not any longer be in your hand as prey, and you will know that I am Yahweh. 22 Because you disheartened the heart of the righteous by deception, and I have not caused him pain, and strengthened the hands of the wicked so that he did not turn from his wicked way to save his life. 23 Therefore falseness you will not see, and divination you will not practice any longer, and I will rescue my people from your hand, and you will know that I am Yahweh!’ ” ",Ezekiel 12-13,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ezekiel-12-13-62601/direct-download/tbd20090908.mp3
Ezekiel,"1 And men from the elders of Israel came to me, and they sat before me. 2 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 3 “Son of man, these men took up their idols into their heart and they placed before themselves a stumbling block of their guilt. Should I really let myself be consulted by them? 4 Therefore speak with them, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Every person from the house of Israel who brings up his idols into his heart and places before himself a stumbling block of his guilt and yet he comes to the prophet, I Yahweh, I will respond to him through this act with respect to the multitude of his idols, 5 so that I may take hold of the house of Israel by their heart, those who are estranged from me, all of them, through their idols.’ 6 Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Return, and turn away from your idols and from all of your detestable things! Turn away your faces!” ’ 7 For each person from the house of Israel, and from the alien who dwells as an alien in Israel, who separates himself from following me and brings up his idols into his heart and places before himself a stumbling block of his guilt, and yet he comes to the prophet to consult him concerning me, I Yahweh will answer him myself. 8 And I will set my face against that person, and I will make him to be a sign and make him into the subject of proverbs; and I will cut him off from the midst of my people, and you will know I am Yahweh. 9 And the prophet, if he is deceived and he speaks a word, I Yahweh, I have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him, and I will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. 10 And they will bear their guilt, like the guilt of the inquirer so the guilt of the prophet will be, 11 so that the house of Israel will not go astray again from me, and they will not make themselves unclean again with all of their transgressions, and they will be for me a people, and I will be for them as God,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 12 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 13 “Son of man, when a land sins against me by acting very unfaithfully, then I will stretch out my hand against it, and I will break for it the supply of food, and I will send against it famine, and I will cut it off, both human and animal. 14 And if even the three of these men were in the midst of it—Noah, Daniel, and Job—they, through their righteousness, would save only themselves!” declares the Lord Yahweh. 15 “If a fierce animal I should let cross through the land, and it should make it childless and it will be a desolation, so that there will not be one crossing over the land due to the presence of the animal, 16 even if these three men were in the midst of it, as surely as I live,” declares the Lord Yahweh, “surely they will not save sons and daughters; they themselves alone, they will be saved, but the land will be a desolation. 17 Or, if I bring a sword over that land, and I say, ‘Sword, let it cross over into the land!’ And I will cut off from it both human and animal. 18 And if these three men were in the midst of it, as surely as I live,” declares the Lord Yahweh, “they will not save sons and daughters, but they alone will be saved. 19 And if I were to send a plague to that land, and I pour out my rage on it with blood to cut it off, both human and animal, 20 and if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in the midst of her, as surely as I live,” declares the Lord Yahweh, “surely not a son, surely not a daughter will they save by their righteousness; they would save themselves.” 21 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “How much more when I send my four punishments—the evil sword, and famine, and a fierce animal, and a plague—to Jerusalem to cut it off, both human and animal! 22 But look! A remnant will be left over in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out. Look! They are coming out to you, and you will see their way, and with their deeds you will be consoled with respect to the evil that I brought over Jerusalem, all of it that I brought over it. 23 And they will console you when you see their way and their deeds, and you will know that not for nothing I did all that I did in it,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, how will the wood of the vine be better than any of the wood of the branch which is among the trees of the forest? 3 Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can they take a tent peg from it to hang on it any object? 4 Look! It is given to the fire as fuel. The fire will consume two of its ends, and its middle will be charred. Is it useful for anything? 5 Look! When it is in perfect condition, it will not be used for anything, how much less when the fire has consumed it and it is charred; and then can it be used again for anything? 6 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Just like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest which I gave to the fire for fuel, so I have given the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 7 And I will set my face against them. From the fire they may escape, but the fire will yet consume them, and they will know that I am Yahweh when I set my face against them. 8 And I will make the land a desolation because they acted very unfaithfully!” declares the Lord Yahweh. 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, make known to Jerusalem its detestable things, 3 and you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth were from the land of the Canaanites, your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite. 4 And as for your birth, on the day you were born your umbilical cord was not cut, and you were not thoroughly washed clean with water, and you were not thoroughly rubbed with salt, and you were not carefully wrapped in strips of cloth. 5 No eye took pity on you to do to you one of these things to show compassion for you, and you were thrown into the open field in their despising of you on the day you were born. 6 “ ‘And I passed by you, and I saw you kicking about in your blood, and I said to you in your blood, “Live! 7 Grow up; I will make you like a plant of the field.” And you grew up, and you became tall and reached full womanhood. Your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown, but you were naked and bare. 8 “ ‘And I passed by you, and I saw you, and look, your time of lovemaking had come, and so I spread out my hem over you, and I covered your nakedness, and I swore to you, and I entered into a covenant with you,’ declares the Lord Yahweh, ‘and you became mine. 9 And I washed you with water, and I rinsed off your blood from on you, and I anointed you with oil. 10 And I clothed you with beautiful finished cloth, and I put sandals on you of fine leather, and I bound you in fine linen, and I covered you with costly fabric. 11 And I adorned you with ornaments, and I put a bracelet on your arms and a necklace on your neck. 12 And I put an ornamental ring on your nose and earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head. 13 And you adorned yourself with gold and silver, and your clothing was fine linen and costly fabric and beautiful finished cloth; you ate finely milled flour and honey and olive oil, and you became exceedingly beautiful; you were fit to be a queen. 14 And a name went out for you among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect because of my majesty that I bestowed on you,’ declares the Lord Yahweh. ",Ezekiel 14:1-16:14,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ezekiel-141-1614-62602/direct-download/tbd20090909.mp3
Ezekiel,"15 ‘And you trusted in your beauty, and you prostituted on account of your name, and you poured out your fornication on every one passing by, saying, “Let it be his.” 16 And you took from your clothes and you made for yourself colorful shrines, and you prostituted on them; this had not happened before, and it will not continue to happen. 17 And you took your beautiful jewelry made from my gold and from my silver that I had given to you, and you made for yourself male images, and you prostituted with them. 18 And you took the clothes of your beautiful finished cloth, and you covered them and my oil and my incense you set before them. 19 And my bread that I gave to you, finely milled flour and oil and honey with which I fed you, then you set it before them as a pleasing odor, and so it was,’ declares the Lord Yahweh. 20 ‘And you took your sons and your daughters whom you had borne for me, and you sacrificed them to them to be eaten, as if your whorings were not enough. 21 And you slaughtered my children, and you gave them to be sacrificed to them. 22 And in all of your detestable things and your fornication you did not remember the days of your childhood when you were naked and bare, when you were kicking about in your blood. 23 “ ‘And then after all of your evil! Woe, woe, to you!’ declares the Lord Yahweh. 24 ‘And then you built for yourself a mound, and you made for yourself a high place in every public square. 25 At the head of every street you built your high place and you disgraced your beauty and you spread your feet for every passerby, and you increased your whoring. 26 And you prostituted with the Egyptians, your neighbors who were sexually aroused, and you increased your fornication to provoke me. 27 And look! I stretched out my hand against you, and I reduced your portion, and I gave you into the desire of your haters, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed because of your lewd conduct. 28 And you prostituted with the Assyrians on account of your insatiable lust, and you prostituted with them, and still you were not satisfied. 29 And you increased your fornication to the land of traders, to Chaldea, and even with this you were not satisfied. 30 How hot with fever was your heart!’ declares the Lord Yahweh. ‘When you did all of these actions of a headstrong female prostitute, 31 when you built your mound at the head of every street and your high place you made on every street, yet you were not like a prostitute, as you were scorning your harlot’s wages. 32 O, adulterous woman! In the place of her husband she received strangers. 33 To all prostitutes they give a fee, but you, you gave your gifts to all of your lovers, and you bribed them to come to you from all around in your whorings! 34 And it was the opposite with you from the other women in your whorings; no one solicited you as a prostitute. You gave a harlot’s wages, and a harlot’s wages were not given to you, and so it was just the opposite. 35 “ ‘Therefore, prostitute, hear the word of Yahweh. 36 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because of the pouring out of your shame and because your nakedness was revealed in your whoring with your lovers, and on account of all of the idols of your detestable things, and according to the blood of your children whom you gave to them, 37 therefore, look! I am gathering all of your lovers whom you were pleased about, and all of whom you loved in addition to all of whom you hated, and I will gather them against you from everywhere, and I will uncover your nakedness to them, and they will see all of your nakedness. 38 And I will judge you with the judgment of women committing adultery and shedding blood, and I will give you the blood of rage and jealousy. 39 And I will give you into their hand, and they will demolish your mound, and they will break down your high places, and they will strip you of your clothes, and they will take your beautiful jewelry, and they will leave you naked and bare. 40 And they will bring up against you a crowd, and they will stone you with stones, and they will cut you to pieces with their swords. 41 And they will burn your houses with fire, and they will execute against you judgments before many women, and I will stop you from prostitution, and also a harlot’s wages you will not give again. 42 And I will satisfy my rage on you, and my jealousy will turn away from you, and I will be calm, and I will not be angry any longer. 43 Because you did not remember the days of your childhood and you made me angry with all of these. And in turn I, look, I will return your way upon your head,’ declares the Lord Yahweh, ‘and did you not do wickedness in addition to all of your detestable things? 44 Look! Everyone quoting a proverb against you, he will quote, saying, ‘Like her mother is her daughter!’ 45 You are a daughter of your mother who abhorred her husband and her children, and you are a sister of your sisters who abhorred their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father was an Amorite. 46 And your elder sister, she is Samaria, and her daughters, who are dwelling on your north, and your younger sister is the one dwelling on your south; she is Sodom and her daughters. 47 And you have not only gone in their ways, but you also did according to their detestable things. In such a short time you behaved more corruptly than they in all of your ways. 48 As surely as I live,’ declares the Lord Yahweh, ‘surely your sister Sodom and her daughters did not do as you and your daughters did. 49 Look! This was the iniquity of Sodom, your sister: Pride, abundance of food, and prosperous ease was to her and to her daughters, and she did not sustain the needy and the poor. 50 And they were proud, and they did a detestable thing before me, and I removed them because I saw it. 51 And Samaria did not sin according to even half of your sins, and you caused your detestable things to increase more than they, and you made your sister righteous in comparison with all of your detestable things that you did. 52 Also, you bear your disgrace, by which you furnished justification to your sisters through your sins by which you acted more abominably than they; they were more righteous than you, and also, you be ashamed and bear your disgrace through your making your sister righteous. 53 And I will restore their fortune, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and even the fortunes of your captivity in the midst of them, 54 in order that you may bear your disgrace and you may be put to shame because of all that you did at your consoling them. 55 And as for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, they will return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters, they will return to their former state, and you and your daughters will return to your former state. 56 And was not Sodom, your sister, a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride 57 before your evil was uncovered? It was like the time of the scorn of the daughters of Aram and all those around her, and of the daughters of the Philistines, those all around who are despising you. 58 Your wickedness and your detestable things, you, you must bear them,’ declares Yahweh. 59 ‘For thus says the Lord Yahweh: And I will do it to you according to what you have done, who despised the oath to break covenant. 60 And I, I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish with you an everlasting covenant. 61 And you will remember your ways, and you will be ashamed when you take your sisters, both the older and the younger, and I give them to you as daughters, but not on account of your covenant. 62 And I, I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am Yahweh, 63 in order that you will remember, and you will be ashamed, and you will not open your mouth again because of your disgrace when I forgive you for all that you have done!’ ” declares the Lord Yahweh. 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, tell a riddle and quote a proverb to the house of Israel, 3 and you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “The great eagle with great wings and long feathers and full of variegated plumage came to Lebanon and he took the treetop of the cedar. 4 He plucked the top of its new plant shoot, and he brought it to the land of Canaan and put it in a city of merchants, 5 and he took from the seed of the land and placed it in fertile soil on many waters; like a willow he planted it. 6 And it sprouted, and it became a vine spreading out, low of height, turning its branches to him, and its roots were under it, and it became a vine, and it made branches, and it sent out foliage. 7 “ ‘ “And there was another great eagle, great of wings and with abundant plumage, and look! This vine stretched out its roots toward him and extended its branches to him to water it from the garden bed where it was planted. 8 It was planted in a good field by many waters to produce branches and to bear fruit to become a beautiful vine.” ’ 9 Say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Will it prosper? Will he not tear out its roots, and will he not make its fruit scaly, and it will wither, and all of the freshness of its vegetation will dry up? And to lift it from its roots will not require great strength or many people. 10 And look! Though it is planted, will it prosper? When the east wind strikes it, will it not dry up completely? On the garden bed of its vegetation it will dry up!” ’ ” 11 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 12 “Say now to the rebellious house of Israel, ‘Do you not know what these are?’ Say, ‘Look! The king of Babylon will come to Jerusalem, and he will take its king and its officials, and he will bring them to himself, to Babylon. 13 And he took from the seed of the kingship, and he made with him a covenant, and he brought him under oath, and he took the rulers of the land, 14 so that they would be a humble kingdom and not lift itself up to keep his covenant in order for it to stand. 15 But he rebelled against him by sending his messengers to Egypt to give to him horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Will he escape doing these things, and can he break the covenant and escape? 16 As I live,’ declares the Lord Yahweh, ‘surely in the place of the king who made him king, who despised his oath and who broke his covenant with him—in the midst of Babylon he will die. 17 And not with a great army and with a great crowd will Pharaoh work with him in the war, at the pouring out of a siege ramp and the building of siege works to destroy many lives. 18 And he despised the oath to break covenant. And, look, he gave his hand in pledge, and yet he did all of these things. He will not escape.’ 19 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘As I live, surely my oath that he despised and my covenant that he broke I will return upon his head. 20 And I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my hunting net, and I will bring him to Babylon, and I will enter into judgment with him there about his infidelity that he displayed against me. 21 And all of his choice troops, among all of his troops, they will fall by the sword, and those who are remaining, they will be scattered to all the directions of the wind, and you will know that I, Yahweh, I have spoken.’ 22 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘And I will take, even I, from the treetop of the high cedar, and I will plant it, from the head of its new plant shoot I will pluck a tender one, and I will plant it, even I, on a high and lofty mountain. 23 On the height of the mountain of Israel I will plant it, and it will carry branches, and it will bear fruit, and it will become a noble cedar, and all of the birds of all wings will dwell under it in the shade of its branches. 24 And all of the trees of the field will know that I, Yahweh, I will bring low a high tree, and I will exalt a low, fresh tree, and I will make a dry tree flourish. I, Yahweh, I have spoken, and I will do it.’ ” 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “What do you mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel, saying, ‘The fathers, they ate unripe fruit, and the teeth of the child became blunt.’ 3 As I live, declares the Lord Yahweh, it will surely not any longer be appropriate for you to quote this proverb in Israel! 4 Look! All lives are mine. The lives of father and son alike are mine. The person sinning will die. 5 And if a man is righteous and does justice and righteousness, 6 and on the mountains he does not eat and he does not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and the wife of his neighbor he does not defile and he does not approach a woman of menstruation, 7 and he oppresses no one and he returns a pledge for his loan and he commits no robbery and he gives his bread to the hungry and he covers a naked person with a garment, 8 and he does not charge interest and he takes no usury, and he holds back his hand from injustice and he executes a judgment of fairness between persons, 9 and in my statutes he goes about and my regulations he keeps, performing faithfully —then he is righteous, and certainly he will live,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 10 “And now he has a son, a violent one, who sheds blood and does any of these things 11 (though he did not do all of these things), for the son also eats on the mountains and he defiles the wife of his neighbor. 12 He oppresses the needy and the poor, and he commits robbery, and he does not return a pledge for a loan, and he lifts his eyes to the idols so he does a detestable thing. 13 He charges interest and takes usury. Then, shall he live? He shall not live, for he did all of these detestable things. Surely he will die! His blood will be on him. 14 “And look! He has a son, and he sees all of the sin of his father that he did, and he sees it, but he does not do it. 15 On the mountains he does not eat, and he does not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and the wife of his neighbor he does not defile. 16 And he oppresses no one; he requires no pledge for a loan, and he does not commit robbery; he gives his bread to the hungry, and he covers the naked person with a garment. 17 He brings back his hand from iniquity; he does not take interest and usury; he does my regulations; he goes in my statutes. He will not die because of the guilt of his father; he will surely live! 18 Because his father oppressed severely; he stole from his brother; that which is not good he did in the midst of his people, and look! He will die through his guilt. 19 “Yet you say, ‘Why does the son not bear the guilt of the father?’ And since the son does justice and righteousness and he keeps all of my statutes and does them, he shall surely live! 20 The person, the one sinning, will die. A son shall not bear the guilt of the father, and a father shall not bear the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be on him; the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him. 21 But if the wicked returns from all of his sins that he has done and he keeps all of my statutes and he does justice and righteousness, he shall surely live; he shall not die! 22 All of his transgressions that he committed will not be remembered against him. Through his righteousness that he has done he shall live. 23 Have I delight by any means in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord Yahweh, and not at his turning from his way, so that he lives? 24 And when the righteous turns from his righteousness, so that he does injustice, and does all of the detestable things that the wicked do, then will he live because of all of his righteousness that he did? Those things will not be remembered because of his infidelity that he displayed, and because of his sin that he committed. Through them he shall die. 25 “Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair!’ Listen, now, house of Israel, is my way not fair? Is it not your ways that are not fair? 26 When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and he does injustice, then he will die because of them; because of his injustice that he did he will die! 27 And when the wicked turns from his wickedness that he did and he does justice and righteousness, he will preserve his life. 28 And if he sees and he returns from all of his transgressions that he did, surely he will live; he will not die! 29 And yet they, the house of Israel, say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair!’ Are not my ways fair, house of Israel? Are not your ways unfair? 30 “Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, each one according to his ways,” declares the Lord Yahweh. “Repent and turn around from all of your transgression, and it will not be as a stumbling block of iniquity to you. 31 Throw away from yourselves all of your transgressions that you committed, and make for yourselves a new heart and new spirit, and so why will you die, house of Israel? 32 For I have no pleasure in the death of the dying,” declares the Lord Yahweh. “And so repent and live!” ",Ezekiel 16:15-18:32,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ezekiel-1615-1832-62603/direct-download/tbd20090910.mp3

She lay down in the midst of young lions, and she reared her lion cubs. 3 And she raised up one from her cubs; he became a fierce lion, and he learned to tear prey; he ate humans. 4 And nations heard about him; in their pit he was caught, and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt. 5 And she saw that she was waiting in vain; her hope was destroyed, and she took one from her cubs, and she made him a fierce lion. 6 And he walked about in the midst of lions; he became a fierce lion, and he learned to tear prey; he ate humans. 7 And he knew their widows, and he devastated their cities, and the land was appalled, and everyone in it at the sound of his roar. 8 And nations set out against him from the surrounding provinces, and they spread their net over him, and he was caught in their pit. 9 And they put him in a collar with hooks, and they brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into a prison, so that his voice would not be heard any longer on the mountains of Israel. 10 Your mother was like the vine in your vineyard; planted fruitfully beside water, and it was full of branches from many waters. 11 And she produced branches of strength to scepters of rulers; its height became tall between thick foliage, and it was seen because of its tallness among the abundance of its branches. 12 But it was uprooted in rage; it was thrown to the earth, and the east wind dried up its fruit; they were stripped off, and its strong branch dried up; fire consumed it. 13 And now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land. 14 And so fire has gone out from the stem of its branches; its fruit it has consumed, and there was not in it a strong branch, a scepter for ruling.’ ” This is a lament, and it will be used as a lament. 1 And then in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, men from the elders of Israel came to consult Yahweh, and they sat before me. 2 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 3 “Son of man, speak with the elders of Israel, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Are you coming to consult me? As I live, I will surely not allow myself to be consulted by you!” ’ declares the Lord Yahweh. 4 Will you judge them? Will you judge them, son of man? Make known to them the detestable things of their ancestors. 5 And you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “On the day of my choosing Israel I swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob, and I made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, and I swore to them, saying, ‘I am Yahweh your God.’ 6 On that day I swore to them to bring them out from the land of Egypt to the land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey—it is the most beautiful of all of the lands. 7 Then I said to them, ‘Let each one throw away the detestable things of his eyes, and you must not make yourselves unclean with the idols of Egypt! I am Yahweh your God.’ 8 But they rebelled against me, and they were not willing to listen to me; each one did not throw away the detestable things of their eyes; and they did not abandon the idols of Egypt, and I decided to pour out my rage on them, to fully vent my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. 9 “But I acted for the sake of my name to keep it from being profaned before the eyes of the nations among whom they lived, where I made known to them before their eyes, to bring them out from the land of Egypt. 10 And I brought them out from the land of Egypt, and I brought them to the desert, 11 and I gave my statutes to them, and my regulations I made known to them, which, if a person does them, then he will live by them. 12 And also my Sabbaths I gave to them to be a sign between me and between them so they would know that I, Yahweh, am the one sanctifying them. 13 “But in the desert the house of Israel rebelled against me; they did not walk in my statutes, and they rejected my regulations, which, if a person does them, he will live by them, and they greatly profaned my Sabbaths, and I decided to pour out my rage on them in the desert to destroy them, 14 and I acted for the sake of my name, that it not be profaned before the eyes of the nations before whom I brought them out. 15 And also I myself swore to them in the desert not to bring them into the land that I had given to them, flowing with milk and honey—it is the most beautiful of all of the lands— 16 because they despised my judgments, and they did not walk in my statutes, and my Sabbaths they profaned, for their heart was going after their idols. 17 But my eye took pity on them by not destroying them, and I did not completely destroy them in the desert. 18 “And I said to their children in the desert, ‘You must not go in the statutes of your parents; you must not keep their regulations, and you must not make yourself unclean with their idols. 19 I, Yahweh, am your God, so go in my statutes and keep my regulations and do them. 20 And treat my Sabbaths as holy, and they will be a sign between me and between you that you may know that I, Yahweh, am your God.’ 21 But the children rebelled against me; they did not walk in my statutes, and they did not observe my regulations, which if a person does them, then he will live by them. My Sabbaths they desecrated, and I decided to pour out my rage on them, to finish my anger against them in the desert. 22 But I withheld my hand, and I acted for the sake of my name not to be profaned before the eyes of the nations before whom I had brought them out before their eyes. 23 What is more, I swore to them in the desert to scatter them among the nations and to disperse them in the lands, 24 because they did not do my regulations, and my statutes they despised, and my Sabbaths they profaned, and their eyes were after the idols of their ancestors. 25 And in turn I gave to them rules that were not good and regulations by which they will not live. 26 And I defiled them through their gifts in sacrificing all of the first offspring of the womb, in order that I will cause them to be stunned, so that they will know that I am Yahweh. 27 “Therefore speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Again in this your ancestors blasphemed me at their display of infidelity toward me.” ’ 28 And I brought them to the land that I swore to give to them, and they saw every high hill and every leafy tree, and they offered their sacrifices, and they presented there the provocation of their offering, and they gave there their fragrant incense offering, and they poured out their libations there. 29 And I said to them, ‘What is the high place to which you are going?’ And it is called Bamah until this day. 30 Therefore thus say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “In the way of your ancestors will you defile yourself, and after their vile idols will you prostitute yourselves? 31 And when you lift up your gifts, sacrificing your children through the fire, you are defiling yourself through all of your idols until today, and will I let myself be consulted by you, house of Israel?” ’ As I live,” declares the Lord Yahweh, “I will not let myself be consulted by you! 32 And what you are planning, surely it will not be—that you are saying, ‘Let us be like the nations, like the clans of the lands, serving wood and stone!’ 33 “As I live,” declares the Lord Yahweh, “surely with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with rage pouring forth I will reign as king over you! 34 And I will bring you from the peoples, and I will gather you from the countries to which you were scattered with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with rage poured out. 35 Then I will bring you to the desert of the peoples, and I will execute justice on you there face to face. 36 Just as I executed justice on your ancestors in the desert of the land of Egypt, likewise I will execute justice on you!” declares the Lord Yahweh. 37 “And I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant. 38 And I will purge the rebels from among you and the ones transgressing against me; I will bring them out from the land where they are living as aliens, but into the land of Israel they will not come, and then you will know that I am Yahweh. 39 And you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Let each one go serve his idols now and after, if you are not listening to me, but my holy name you will not profane any longer with your gifts and with your idols. 40 “For on my holy mountain, on the mountain of the height of Israel,” declares the Lord Yahweh, “there all of the house of Israel will serve me, all of them, in the land. I will take pleasure in them, and there I will accept your contributions and the best of your portions with all of your holy objects. 41 I will accept you as a fragrant incense offering when I bring you out from the peoples and I gather you from the lands to which you were scattered, and I will show myself holy among you before the eyes of the nations. 42 And you will know that I am Yahweh when I bring you to the land of Israel, to the land that I swore to give to your ancestors. 43 And you will remember there your ways, and all of your deeds by which you were made unclean, and you will feel a loathing for yourself for all of your evils that you have done. 44 And you will know that I am Yahweh when I deal with you for the sake of my name and not according to your evil ways or according to your corrupted deeds, house of Israel,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 45 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 46 “Son of man, set your face toward the way of the south, and preach to the south, and prophesy against the forest of the territory of the Negev. 47 And you must say to the forest of the Negev, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am kindling against you a fire, and it will devour in you every fresh tree and every dry tree; the blaze of the flame will not be quenched, and all the surfaces from the south to the north will be scorched by it. 48 And all creatures will see that I, Yahweh, I kindled it—it will not be quenched!” ’ ” 49 Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh, they are saying about me, ‘Is he not posing a parable?’ ” ",Ezekiel 18:32-20:49,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ezekiel-1832-2049-62604/direct-download/tbd20090911.mp3
Ezekiel,"1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and preach to the sanctuaries, and prophesy to the land of Israel. 3 And you must say to the land of Israel, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Look! I am against you, and I will draw out my sword from its sheath, and I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked. 4 Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my sword will go out from its sheath to all creatures from south to north. 5 And they will know, all creatures, that I, Yahweh, I will bring out my sword from its sheath; it will not return again!” ’ 6 And you, son of man, groan with shaking hips, and you must groan with bitterness before their eyes. 7 And then when they say to you, ‘On account of what are you groaning?’ then you must say, ‘On account of the report, for it is coming, and every heart will be weak and all hands will hang limp and every spirit will be disheartened, and all knees will go like water.’ Look! It is coming, and it will happen!” declares the Lord Yahweh. 8 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 9 “Son of man, prophesy, and you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord,’ say, ‘A sword, a sword is sharpened and is also polished. 10 It is sharpened to slaughter a slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! Or will we rejoice? A rod, my son, is despising every tree. 11 And he gives it to be polished, to be seized by the hand. It is sharpened—a sword—and it is polished to give it into the hand of the killer. 12 Cry and wail, son of man, for it is against my people; it is against all of the princes of Israel. They are thrown to the sword with my people; therefore strike your thigh. 13 For examine! And what if also the rod will not be despising?’ declares the Lord Yahweh. 14 And you, son of man, prophesy and clap your hands. And the sword will strike twice; let it happen a third time. It is a sword of the dead, the sword of the great dead that is surrounding them, 15 so that a heart melts, and the fallen multiply at all of their gates. I gave a sword for slaughter, and alas! It is made for flashing, it is grasped for slaughtering. 16 Gather together, strike to the right; cause to go to the left, where your edge is directed. 17 And also I myself will clap my hands, and I will satisfy my rage! I, Yahweh, I have spoken.” 18 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 19 “And you, son of man, mark out for yourself two roads for the coming of the sword of the king of Babylon; they must both go out from the same land. And hew out a signpost; hew it at the head of the road of the city. 20 You must mark a road for the coming of the sword to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah, in Jerusalem the fortified. 21 For the king of Babylon stands at the fork of the road at the head of the two roads to practice divination. He shakes the arrows, he inquires with the teraphim, he examines the liver. 22 In his right hand is the divination for Jerusalem, to put up battering rams, to open a mouth for slaughter, to raise the battle cry, to put up battering rams against gates, to build a siege ramp, to build siege works. 23 And it will be to them like practicing divination falsely in their eyes; they have sworn oaths for themselves. But he will bring their guilt to remembrance so as to seize them. 24 “Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because you have brought to remembrance your guilt by the uncovering of your transgressions, so that your sins in all of your deeds appear—because of your being remembered, you will be captured in the hand.’ 25 And as for you, profane one, wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come with the time of the punishment of the end, 26 thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Remove the turban and lift off the crown; things are no longer the same. Exalt the low and bring low the high. 27 A ruin, a ruin, a ruin I will make it! Also this has not ever happened; it will remain until the coming of the one to whom the judgment belongs and I have given it to him.’ 28 And you, son of man, prophesy, and you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the Ammonites and concerning their disgrace,’ and you must say, ‘A sword, a sword is drawn for slaughtering; it is polished for holding, for flashing like lightning, 29 when seeing a false vision for you in vain, when practicing divination for you falsely, to give you on the neck of the profane ones of the wicked, whose day has come, the time of final punishment. 30 Return it to its sheath in the place where you were created. In the land of your origin I will judge you! 31 And I will pour out my anger on you; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and I will give you into the hand of brutal men, skilled craftsmen of destruction. 32 You will be as fuel for the fire; your blood will be in the midst of the earth. You will not be remembered, for I, Yahweh, I have spoken.’ ” 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “And you, son of man, will you judge? Will you judge the bloody city? Then you must make known to her all of her detestable things! 3 And you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “A city pouring out blood in the midst of her; its time has come, and it made idols for itself, becoming unclean. 4 By your blood that you poured out you have become guilty, and by your idols that you made you have become unclean, and you have brought your days near, and your appointed years have come. Therefore I have made you a disgrace for the nations and a laughingstock to all of the countries. 5 The people near and the people far from you will make fun of you, the unclean and the terrified. 6 Look! The princes of Israel, each one according to his strength, they are in you for the shedding of blood. 7 They have treated father and mother with contempt in you; they violated the alien with extortion; in the midst of you they mistreated the orphan and widow. 8 You despised my holy objects; my Sabbaths you profaned. 9 Slanderous men are among you to shed blood, and they, among you, eat upon the mountains; they do wickedness in the midst of you. 10 They uncover the nakedness of a father among you; they violate a woman unclean of menstruation among you. 11 And a man does a detestable thing with the wife of his neighbor, and a man defiles his daughter-in-law in wickedness, and a man sexually violates among you his sister, the daughter of his father. 12 They take a bribe among you in order to shed blood; and you take usury, and you make gain from your neighbors by extortion, and so you have forgotten me, declares the Lord Yahweh. 13 And look! I strike my hand for your ill-gotten gain that you have made and at your blood that was in the midst of you. 14 Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong at the days in which I am dealing with you? I, Yahweh, I have spoken, and I will act! 15 I will scatter you among the nations, and I will disperse you through the countries, and I will purge your uncleanness from you. 16 And I will be profaned by you before the eyes of the nations, and you will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ ” 17 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 18 “Son of man, the house of Israel has become as silver dross to me; all of them are as bronze and tin and iron and lead in the midst of a furnace, even as silver dross, silver dross they became! 19 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because all of you have become as silver dross, therefore look! I am gathering you to the midst of Jerusalem, 20 like the gathering of silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin to the middle of a furnace to blow fire on it for melting. Thus I will gather in my anger and in my rage, and I will deposit you, and I will melt you. 21 And I will gather you, and I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and so I will melt you in the midst of her. 22 Thus you will be melted like the melting of silver in the midst of a furnace, and you will know that I, Yahweh, I have poured out my rage on you.’ ” 23 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 24 “Son of man, say to her, ‘You are a land not cleansed; it is not rained upon in the day of indignation.’ 25 The conspiracy of its prophets in the midst of her is like a roaring lion that is tearing prey. They devour people, and they take wealth and treasure; they make its widows numerous in the midst of her. 26 Its priests treat my law violently, and they profane my holy objects; they do not distinguish between a holy object and what is unholy, or between the clean and the unclean. They do not teach the difference, and they hide their eyes from my Sabbaths, and so I am profaned in the midst of them. 27 Its officials are like wolves tearing prey in its midst, to pour out blood, to destroy people, to make dishonest gain. 28 And for them its prophets plaster whitewash; they are seeing falseness and are practicing divination for them by lying, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh,’ and Yahweh has not spoken. 29 They severely oppress the people of the land, and they committed robbery, and they mistreated the needy and the poor, and they oppressed the alien without justice. 30 And so I sought for them somebody, one repairing the wall and standing in the breach before me on behalf of the land not to destroy it, but I did not find anyone, 31 and so I poured out my indignation on them. With the fire of my wrath I destroyed them; I returned their way upon their head,” declares the Lord Yahweh.

Ezekiel,"1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother, 3 and they prostituted themselves in Egypt in their childhood; they were prostituting themselves there, and their breasts were fondled, and there they caressed the bosoms of their virginity. 4 Now as for their names, the older was Oholah, and Oholibah was her sister. And they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters, and their names are Samaria for Oholah, and Jerusalem for Oholibah. 5 And Oholah prostituted herself while she was still mine, and she lusted for her lovers, for Assyria who was nearby, 6 clothed in blue cloth, governors and prefects, handsome young men and all of them horsemen, experts on horseback. 7 And she bestowed her fornication on them, on the choice ones of the Assyrians, all of them, and with every one after which she lusted; with all of their idols she defiled herself. 8 And her whorings from the time of Egypt she did not abandon, for they slept with her in her childhood, and they caressed the bosoms of her virginity, and they poured out their fornication on her. 9 Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians after whom she lusted. 10 They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, and they killed her with the sword. And she became a name for the women, and they executed judgments against her. 11 “And though Oholibah her sister saw, yet in her lust she behaved more corruptly than her, and her whoring was more than the prostitution of her sister. 12 She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and prefects, warriors clothed in perfection, expert horsemen, all of them handsome young men. 13 And I saw that she was defiled; they had both taken the same path! 14 And she increased her whorings, and she saw men carved on the wall, images of Chaldeans carved in red, 15 belted with a belt at their waist with turbans on their heads, all of them giving the appearance of adjutants, the image of the Babylonians; Chaldea was the land of their birth. 16 And she lusted for them when her eyes saw them, and she sent messengers to them at Chaldea. 17 And so the Babylonians came to her for the bed of lovemaking; and they defiled her with their fornication, and she was defiled by them, and she turned from them. 18 And she revealed her whorings, and she revealed her nakedness, and so I turned from her just as I turned from her sister. 19 Yet she increased her whorings, recalling the days of her childhood when she was prostituted in the land of Egypt. 20 And she lusted after her male lovers whose genitalia were the genitalia of male donkeys and their seminal emission was the seminal emission of horses. 21 And you longed after the obscene conduct of your youth when your bosom was caressed by Egypt, fondling your young breasts. 22 “Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Look! I am stirring up your lovers against you concerning whom you turned away, and I will bring them against you from all around: 23 the Babylonians and all of the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, all of the Assyrians along with them, handsome young men, governors and prefects, all of them adjutants and excellent horsemen. 24 And they will come against you with an army chariot and wagon and with a crowd of peoples; they will set themselves against you from all around with large shield and small shield and helmet. And I will give before them judgment, and they will judge you with their judgments. 25 And I will direct my zeal against you, and they will deal with you in anger; your nose and your ears they will remove, and those who are left, they will fall by the sword, and they will take your sons and your daughters, and your remnant will be consumed by fire. 26 And they will strip you of your clothes, and they will take your splendid jewelry. 27 And I will put an end to your obscene conduct coming from you and your fornication from the land of Egypt, and you will not lift your eyes to them; and you will not remember Egypt again.’ 28 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Look! I am giving you into the hand of those you hated, into the hand of those from whom you turned away. 29 And they will deal with you in hatred, and they will take all of your acquisitions, and they will leave you naked and in bareness; and the nakedness of your fornication and your obscene conduct and your whorings will be exposed. 30 These things are accomplished against you since you prostituted yourself after the nations, and on account of that, you defiled yourself by their idols. 31 You went in the same way of your sister, and I will give her cup into your hand.” ’ 32 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “You will drink the deep and wide cup of your sister; you will be as laughter and as scorn; the cup holds so much! 33 You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, for a cup of horror and desolation is the cup of your sister, Samaria. 34 And you will drink it, and you will drain it, and its potsherds you will gnaw, and you will tear out your breasts, for I myself spoke,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 35 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because you have forgotten me, and you threw me behind your back, now in turn you bear your obscene conduct and your whorings.” 36 And Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah and declare their abominable deeds to them? 37 For they committed adultery, and blood is on their hands, and they committed adultery with their idols, and even their children that they had borne for me—they sacrificed them as food! 38 Also they did this to me: they defiled my sanctuary on that day, and they profaned my Sabbaths, 39 and when they slaughtered their children for their idols, they came to my sanctuary on that day to profane it. And look, this is what they did in my house! 40 What is worse, they sent for men who come from a distant place, to whom a messenger was sent to them, and look! They came! Men for whom you bathed and painted your eyes, and you adorned yourself with an ornament. 41 And you sat on a magnificent couch and a table prepared before her, and my incense and my olive oil you put on her. 42 And a sound of a carefree crowd was with it, and in addition to these men, a crowd of drunken men was brought in from the desert, and they put bracelets on their arms and a crown of splendor on their heads. 43 And I said to the one worn out with adulteries, ‘Now they will prostitute her concerning her fornication, even her.’ 44 And so they went to her like going to a female prostitute; and thus they went to Oholah and to Oholibah, the women of obscene conduct. 45 But righteous men, they will judge them with the judgment of committing adultery, and with the judgment of shedding blood; for they were committing adultery, and blood was on their hands.” 46 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Bring up against them an assembly, and make them as a thing of horror and as plunder. 47 And an assembly must stone them with stones, and they must cut them down. With their swords they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and with fire they shall burn their houses. 48 And I will cause obscene conduct to cease from the land, and all of the women will be warned, and they will not do according to your wickedness. 49 And they will repay your obscene conduct upon you, and the guilt of your idols you will bear, and you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh. 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, saying, 2 “Son of man, write for yourself the name of the day, this very day. The king of Babylon laid siege to Jerusalem on exactly this day! 3 And deliver a proverb to the rebellious house, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Place the pot! Place it and also pour water into it. 4 Gather its pieces to it, every good piece, thigh and shoulder, fill it with choice bones; 5 take the choicest of the flock, and also pile the bones under it; boil it vigorously; indeed, its bones boiled in the midst of it.” ’ ” 6 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Woe to the city of bloodguilt! A pot that has its rust in it; its rust did not go out from it. Bring it out piece by piece; one is as good as another. 7 For her blood was in the midst of her; she put it on a bare rock; she did not pour it on the ground to cover it with dust. 8 To stir up rage, to avenge myself through vengeance, I placed its blood on the barrenness of a rock, so that it may not be covered.” 9 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Woe to the city of bloodguilt! I, even I, will make the pile of wood great! 10 Pile up the logs; kindle the fire; finish cooking the meat, and mix in the spices, and let the bones be burned. 11 And make it stand empty upon its burning coals so that it may become hot, and its copper may become molten and be melted in the midst of it, so that its uncleanness and its rust be consumed. 12 Through effort she has caused weariness; its thick rust went not out of it. Its rust! Into the fire with its rust! 13 In your uncleanness is obscene conduct, because I cleansed you, but you were not clean from your uncleanness; you will not be clean again until I fully vent my rage on you. 14 I, Yahweh, I have spoken. It is coming, and I did it; I will not disregard, and I will not take pity, and I will not reconsider. According to your ways and according to your deeds they will judge you!” declares the Lord Yahweh. 15 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 16 “Son of man, look! I am taking from you what is pleasing to your eyes with a plague, but you shall not mourn, and you shall not weep, and your tears shall not run down. 17 Sigh in silence for the dead; you shall not make a mourning ceremony. Bind your turban on you, and you must put your sandals on your feet. You must not cover your upper lip, and the bread of mourners you shall not eat.” 18 And I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening, and I did in the morning just as I was commanded. 19 And the people said to me, “Will you not make known to us what these things that you are doing mean for us?” 20 And I said to them that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 21 “Say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I will be profaning my sanctuary, the pride of your strength and the delight of your eyes and the object of your own affection; and your sons and your daughters whom you left behind will fall by the sword, 22 and you shall do just as I did: You shall not cover your upper lip, and you shall not eat the bread of mourners. 23 And your turban must be on your heads, and your sandals must be on your feet. You shall not mourn, and you shall not weep, but you shall waste away because of your iniquities, and you shall groan to one another. 24 And Ezekiel will be to you as a sign; everything that he did you shall do; and when it comes you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh. 25 “And you, son of man, will it not be that on the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their glory, the delight of their eyes, and the longing of their inner self, their sons and daughters— 26 on that day a survivor will come to you with the news. 27 On that day your mouth shall be opened at the arrival of the fugitive, and you shall speak, and you shall not be silent any longer, and you shall be to them as a sign, and they will know that I am Yahweh.” ",Ezekiel 23-24,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ezekiel-23-24-62606/direct-download/tbd20090915.mp3
Ezekiel,"1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, set your face toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them, 3 and you must say to the Ammonites, ‘Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh! Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because of your saying, ‘Ah!’ to my sanctuary when it was profaned, and to the land of Israel when it was desolate, and to the house of Judah when they went into the exile, 4 therefore look! I am giving you to the people of the East as a possession, and they will set up their encampments in you, and they will make in you their dwelling places; they themselves will eat your fruit and they themselves will drink your milk. 5 And I will make Rabbah as a pasture of camels and the Ammonites as a haunt of flocks, and they will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ ” 6 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because of clapping your hand and stamping with your foot, and because you rejoiced in yourself with all of your malice over the land of Israel, 7 therefore look! I stretched out my hand against you, and I will give you as plunder to the nations, and I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will destroy you from the countries, and I will wipe you out, and you will know that I am Yahweh.” 8 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because of Moab and Seir saying, ‘The house of Judah is like all of the nations,’ 9 therefore, look! I am opening the side of Moab from the cities on its frontier, the glory of the land: Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim. 10 I will give it to the people of the East in addition to the Ammonites as a possession, so that the Ammonites will not be remembered among the nations. 11 And on Moab I will execute punishments, and they will know that I am Yahweh.” 12 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because of the doings of Edom in avenging himself with vengeance for the house of Judah, and so they became very guilty and they avenged themselves on them,” 13 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “so I will stretch out my hand against Edom and I will cut off from it both human and animal, and I will make it a ruin from Teman and Dedan; they will fall by the sword. 14 And I will exact my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they will do in Edom according to my anger and according to my rage, and they will know my vengeance,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 15 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because of the acting of the Philistines in vengeance, so that they avenged themselves relentlessly with malice in themselves for destruction with everlasting hostility, 16 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Look! I am stretching out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Kerethites, and I will destroy the remainder of the seacoast. 17 And I will execute on them great vengeance with punishments of rage, and they will know that I am Yahweh when I exact my vengeance on them!” 1 And it was in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, because Tyre said concerning Jerusalem, ‘Ah! The gates of the peoples are broken; it has swung open to me; I shall be filled, for it lies in ruins!’ 3 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Look! I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring up against you many nations like the stirring up of the sea stirring up its waves. 4 And I will destroy the walls of Tyre, and they will demolish its towers, and I will scrape away its earthen dirt from it, and I will make it into a bare rock. 5 It will become a place for spreading out dragnets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken,’ declares the Lord Yahweh. ‘And it will become as plunder for the nations, 6 and its daughters who are in the field with the sword, they will be killed; and they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 7 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am bringing to Tyre Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, from the north, the king of kings, with horse and with chariot and with horsemen and his assembly and many people. 8 Your daughters he will kill in the field with the sword, and he will place against you siege works, and he will build against you a siege ramp, and he will raise against you a shield, 9 and the thrust of his battering ram he will direct against your walls, and your towers he will break down with his weapons. 10 From the abundance of his horses he will cover you with their fine dust; at the sound of horseman and wheel and chariot your walls will shake, at his coming into your gates like the entrance of a city that is being broken through. 11 With the hooves of his horses he will trample all of your streets. He will kill your people with the sword, and your strong stone pillars will tumble down to the earth. 12 And they will plunder your wealth, and they will loot your merchandise, and they will break down your walls, and the houses of your delight they will break down, and your stones and your timbers and your earthen dirt they will cast into the midst of the water. 13 And, I will put an end to the noise of your songs, and the sound of your lyres will not be heard any longer. 14 And I will make you into a bare rock, a place for the spreading out of dragnets. You will not be built again, for I, Yahweh, I have spoken,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 15 Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Tyre, “Will not the coastlands shake from the sound of your downfall, at the groaning of the wounded, at people being killed in the midst of you? 16 And all the princes of the sea will go down from their thrones, and they will remove their robes, and their beautiful garments of finished cloth they will take off. With terror they will be clothed, and on the ground they will sit, and they will tremble continually, and they will be appalled over you. 17 And they will raise a lament over you, and they will say to you, ‘How you have been lost who was inhabited from the seas; the city that was praised, that was strong. It is located on the sea, and its inhabitants imposed their terror on all of its inhabitants. 18 Now the coastlands will tremble at the day of your downfall, and the islands that are in the sea will be horrified because of your departure.’ ” 19 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “When I make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited, when bringing up over you the deep, the great surging waters will cover you. 20 And I will bring you down with those who are going down to the grave, an ancient people, and I will cause you to dwell in the world of the depths, in the ruins from of old with those who are going down to the grave, so that you will not be inhabited and have a place in the land of the living. 21 Sudden terrors I will bring on you, and you shall no longer exist; and you will be sought, and you will not be found again forever,” declares the Lord Yahweh.

Ezekiel,"1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “And you, son of man, raise a lament against Tyre. 3 And you must say to Tyre, the one who sits at the entrance of the sea as the merchant of the peoples to the many coastlands, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Tyre, you yourself said “I am perfect in beauty!” 4 In the heart of the seas are your boundaries; your builders perfected your beauty. 5 They built with pine trees from Senir all of your boards for you; they took cedars from Lebanon to make a sailing mast for you. 6 They made your oars with oaks from Bashan; your deck they made with inlaid ivory, with cypress trees from the coastlands of Cyprus. 7 Your sail was fine linen with colorful weaving from Egypt to serve as a banner for you; blue and purple cloth from the coastlands of Cyprus was your awning. 8 The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvan were your rowers; your skilled men, O Tyre, were from your own people, and they were your seamen. 9 The elders of Gebal and its skilled men were among you as the repairers of the seam of your boat; all of the ships of the sea and their mariners were among you to barter your wares. 10 Persia and Lud and Put were among your soldiers; small shield and helmet hung among you and gave to you your adornment. 11 The people of Arvan and Helech were on your walls all around, and Gammadites were in your towers. They hung their quivers on your walls all around; they perfected your beauty. 12 “ ‘Tarshish was your trader; from the abundance of all of their wealth, with silver, iron, tin, and lead they exchanged for your merchandise. 13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech were your traders; in exchange for people and an object of bronze they gave you your wares. 14 From Beth Togarmah they exchanged horses and war horses and mules for your wares. 15 The people of Dedan were trading with you, many coastlands composed the region of your influence; they brought back horns of ivory and ebony as your payment. 16 Edom was trading with you because of the abundance of your products, trading with malachite, purple wool yarn and colorful weaving, and fine white fabric and black corals and rubies; all these they exchange for your merchandise. 17 Judah and the land of Israel were trading with you with wheat from Minnith and millet and honey and olive oil and balm; all these they gave for your wares. 18 Damascus was trading with you because of the abundance of your products, because of the abundance of all of your wealth, trading with the wine of Helbon and white wool. 19 Vedan and Javan from Uzal, they exchanged wrought iron, cinnamon, and reed spice for your merchandise; all this was for your wares. 20 Dedan was trading with you, with garments of woven material for riding. 21 Arabia and all of the leaders of Kedar were your customers; with young rams and adult rams and goats they were trading with them with you. 22 The traders of Sheba and Raamah were trading with you, with the finest of every spice and with every precious stone and gold; they exchanged all these for your merchandise. 23 Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traders of Sheba, Assyria, and Kilmad were trading with you. 24 They were trading with you in finery, in mantles of blue cloth and colorful embroidered work and with rugs of variegated cloth in twisted cords and knotted tightly; these were among your merchandise. 25 The ships of Tarshish were carrying for you your wares, and you were filled, and you became very heavy in the heart of the seas. 26 “ ‘Into many waters the rowers brought you; but the east wind wrecked you in the heart of the seas. 27 Your wealth and your merchandise, your wares, your mariners, and your seamen, your shipwrights and the barterers of your wares and all of your soldiers who are in you, along with all of your crew who are in the midst of you, they will fall in the heart of the seas on the day of your downfall. 28 At the sound of the shout of your seamen, the pasturelands will shake. 29 And they will go down from their ships, all of those holding an oar, mariners, all of the seamen of the sea will stand on the land, 30 and they will lament over you with their voice, and they will cry out bitterly, and they will throw dust on their heads, and they will roll in the dust. 31 They will shave themselves bald for your sake, and they will dress themselves in sackcloth, and they will weep over you with a bitterness of soul and with bitter wailing. 32 And they will raise over you with their wailing a lament, and they will chant a lament over you: ‘Who is like Tyre, like this destruction in the midst of the sea?’ 33 When your merchandise went out from the seas, you satisfied many peoples with the abundance of your wealth, and by your wares you made rich the kings of the world. 34 Now you are broken by seas in the depths of waters; your wares and all of your crew in the midst of you have sunk. 35 All of the inhabitants of the coastlands are appalled over you, and their kings shudder in horror; they distort their faces! 36 The traders among the peoples hiss over you; you have become a horror, and you shall be no more forever!’ ” 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, say to the leader of Tyre, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because your heart was haughty, and you said, ‘I am a god; I sit in the seat of the gods, I sit in the heart of the seas!’ But you are a human, not a god, and you gave your heart to be like the heart of a god. 3 Look, are you wiser than Daniel, so that no secret is hidden from you? 4 By your wisdom and by your understanding you have gained for yourself wealth, and you have amassed gold and silver in your treasuries. 5 By the abundance of your wisdom in your trading you have increased your wealth and your heart was proud in your wealth.” ’ ” 6 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because of your regarding your mind like the mind of a god, 7 therefore look! I am bringing strangers over you, the most ruthless of the peoples, and they will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they will defile your splendor. 8 They will thrust you down to the pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas. 9 Will you indeed still say “I am a god!” before the face of your killers? And in fact you are a human and not a god in the hand of those who pierce you. 10 You will die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers, for I myself have spoken!” declares the Lord Yahweh. 11 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 12 “Son of man, raise a lament over the king of Tyre, and you must say to him, ‘thus says the Lord Yahweh: “You were a perfect model of an example, full of wisdom and perfect of beauty. 13 You were in Eden, the garden of God, and every precious stone was your adornment: carnelian, topaz and moonstone, turquoise, onyx and jasper, sapphire, malachite and emerald. And gold was the craftsmanship of your settings and your mountings in you; on the day when you were created they were prepared. 14 You were an anointed guardian cherub, and I placed you on God’s holy mountain; you walked in the midst of stones of fire. 15 You were blameless in your ways from the day when you were created, until wickedness was found in you. 16 In the abundance of your trading, they filled the midst of you with violence, and you sinned; and I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, and I expelled you, the guardian cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 17 Your heart was proud because of your beauty; you ruined your wisdom because of your splendor. I threw you on the ground before kings; I have exposed you for viewing. 18 From the abundance of your iniquities in the dishonesty of your trading, I profaned your sanctuaries and I brought fire from your midst; it consumed you, and I have turned you to ashes on the earth before the eyes of everyone who sees you. 19 All who know you among the peoples are appalled over you; you have become as horrors, and you shall cease to exist forever.” ’ ” 20 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 21 “Son of man, set your face toward Sidon and prophesy against it, 22 and you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am against you, Sidon, and I display my glory in the midst of you, and they will know that I am Yahweh when I execute my judgments, and I will show myself holy within it. 23 And I will send into it a plague, and blood will be in its streets.

Ezekiel,"25 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples to which they were scattered about in them, and I show myself holy in them before the eyes of the nations, then they will live on their soil, which I gave to my servant Jacob. 26 And they will live on it in safety, and they will build houses, and they will plant vineyards, and they will live in safety when I execute my judgments on all those who despise them from all around them, and then they will know that I am Yahweh their God.” 1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against Egypt, all of it. 3 Speak, and you must say, ‘thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great sea monster, the one lying down in the midst of his Nile streams, who says to me, “It is my Nile, and I made it for myself.” 4 And so I will put hooks in your jawbones, and I will make the fish of your Nile streams stick to your scales, and I will bring you up from the midst of your Nile streams, and all of the fish of your Nile streams which cling to your scales. 5 And I will fling you to the desert, you and all the fish of your Nile streams. On the surface of the field you will fall; you will not be gathered, and you will not be assembled. To the animals of the field and to the birds of the heavens I will give you as food. 6 And all of the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, because of their being a staff of reed for the house of Israel. 7 When they took hold of you with the hand, you snapped, and you split their every shoulder. And when they leaned on you, you broke, and you caused all of their loins to wobble.” 8 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am bringing on you a sword, and I will cut off from you human and animal. 9 And the land of Egypt will become a desolation and ruins, and they will know that I am Yahweh because he said, ‘The Nile is mine! And I, I made it!’ 10 Therefore look! I am against you and against your Nile streams, and I will make the land of Egypt into ruins, a pile of rubble, a desolation from Migdol to Syene and up to the boundary of Cush. 11 A foot of a human will not pass over it, and a foot of an animal will not pass over it, and so it will not be inhabited for forty years. 12 And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated countries, and its cities to be in the midst of ruined cities. They will be a desolation for forty years, and I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will disperse them among the countries.” 13 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “At the end of forty years I will gather Egypt from the peoples among whom they were scattered. 14 And I will restore the fortunes of Egypt, and I will bring them back to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and they will be a lowly kingdom there. 15 Of all the kingdoms it will be the most lowly, and it will not exalt itself again over the nations, and I will make them small so as not to rule over the nations. 16 And it will not be again for the house of Israel an object of trust, bringing to remembrance their guilt when they turned back to them, and they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.” 17 And then in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 18 “Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, he made his army labor hard against Tyre. Every head was rubbed bare, and every shoulder was rubbed raw, but a wage was not paid for him and for his army from Tyre for the labor that he did against it.” 19 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am giving to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon the land of Egypt, and he will carry its wealth away, and he will plunder its plunder, and he will loot its loot, and it will be a wage for his army. 20 As his wages that he worked for, I will give to him the land of Egypt, because they worked for me,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 21 “On that day I will cause power to grow up for the house of Israel, and for you I will give an opening of your mouth in the midst of them, and they will know that I am Yahweh.” 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, prophesy, and you must say, ‘thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Wail, alas! For the day! 3 For a day is near; indeed, a day is near for Yahweh. A day of cloud, a time of the nations it will be. 4 And a sword will come in Egypt, and anguish will be in Cush, at the falling of the slain in Egypt. And they will take its wealth, and its foundation will be demolished. 5 Cush and Put and Lud and all of Arabia and Kub and the people of the land of the treaty with them—by the sword they will fall.” 6 Thus says Yahweh: “And the supporters of Egypt will fall, and the majesty of its strength will go down from Migdol to Syene; by the sword they will fall in it,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 7 “And they will be desolate in the midst of desolate countries, and its cities will be in the midst of ruined cities. 8 And they will know that I am Yahweh when I put my fire in Egypt, and all of its helpers are broken. 9 On that day messengers will go down from before me in the ships to terrify unsuspecting Cush, and anguish will be in them on the day of Egypt; for look, it is coming!” 10 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “And I will put an end to the crowds of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon. 11 He and his people with him, the most ruthless of nations, will be brought to destroy the land. And they will draw their swords against Egypt, and they will fill the land with the slain, 12 and I will make the Nile streams dry land, and I will sell the land into the hand of bad people, and I will lay waste the land and its fullness by the hand of strangers. I, Yahweh, I have spoken.” 13 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “And I will destroy the idols, and I will put an end to the worthless idols from Memphis. And there will no longer be a prince from the land of Egypt, and I will put fear in the land of Egypt. 14 And I will lay waste Pathros, and I will set fire in Zoan, and I will execute judgments in No. 15 I will pour out my rage over Sin, the stronghold of Egypt, and I will cut off the crowd of No. 16 And I will set fire in Egypt, certainly Sin will writhe, and No will be breached, and Memphis will face enemies daily. 17 The young men of On and Pi Beseth will fall by the sword, and they will go into captivity. 18 And at Tahpanhes the day will become dark when I break the yoke of Egypt, and in it the majesty of its strength will come to an end. A cloud will cover it, and its daughters will go into captivity. 19 And I will execute judgments in Egypt, and they will know that I am Yahweh.” 20 And then in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 21 “Son of man, the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, I have broken. And look, it has not been bound up for giving of a remedy, or for the placing of a splint to bind it up to make it strong to take hold of the sword.” 22 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and I will break his strong arm and the broken arm, and I will let the sword fall from his hand. 23 And I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will disperse them among the countries. 24 And I will strengthen the arm of the king of Babylon, and I will give my sword into his hand, and I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan with the groaning of the mortally wounded before him. 25 And I will strengthen the arm of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh will fall. And they will know that I am Yahweh when I give my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will stretch it out to the land of Egypt. 26 And I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will disperse them into the countries, and they will know that I am Yahweh.” ",Ezekiel 28:25-30:26,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ezekiel-2825-3026-62609/direct-download/tbd20090918.mp3
Ezekiel,"1 And then in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, say to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to his crowd, ‘To whom are you like in your greatness? 3 Look! Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches and a forest giving shade, and very high, and its treetop was between the clouds. 4 Waters made it great, the deep made it grow high; its rivers were going all around its planting area, and its channels it sent out to all of the trees of the field. 5 Therefore it became tall, with its height more than all of the trees of the field, and its branches became numerous, and its branches became long from its sending its shoots from abundant water. 6 In its branches all the birds of the heaven made their nest, and under its branches all the animals of the field gave birth, and in its shadow all the many nations lived. 7 And it was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches, for its root was toward much water. 8 Cedars in the garden of God could not be equal to it; fir trees could not resemble its branches, and plane trees were not even like its branches; any tree even in the garden of God could not resemble it in its beauty. 9 I made it beautiful with the abundance of its branches, and all of the trees of Eden that were in the garden of God envied it.’ ” 10 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because it was tall in height and it set its treetop between thick clouds, and he took pride in his tallness, 11 then I gave it into the hand of the leader of nations; he dealt thoroughly with it according to its wickedness. I drove it out. 12 And strangers cut it off, the most ruthless of nations, and they abandoned it. On the mountains and in all of the valleys its branches fell, and its branches were broken in all the river channels of the land, and all the peoples of the world went out from its shadow, and they abandoned it. 13 On its fallen trunk all the birds of the heaven now dwell, and all the animals of the field were on its branches. 14 This occurred so that all of the trees with abundant water will not become tall, and they will not set their treetop between their thick foliage, and so that all of the trees that are abundantly watered will not stand up to them in their tallness, for all of them, they have been given over to death, to the world below in the midst of mortals, to the people going down to the grave.” 15 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “On the day of its going down to Sheol, I caused mourning; I covered over it with the deep, and I withheld its rivers, and many waters were restrained, and I brought gloom over it; Lebanon and all of the trees of the field, they had fainted because of it. 16 From the sound of its downfall I caused nations to shake when I made it go down to Sheol, with the people going down to the grave, and so in the world below all of the trees of Eden, the choice and the best of Lebanon, all the well-watered trees were comforted! 17 They also went down with it to Sheol to those who died by the sword, and its army who had lived in its shadow in the midst of nations. 18 To whom could you be compared, whether in glory or in majesty among the trees of Eden? And yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the world below; in the midst of the uncircumcised you will lie with those who died by the sword. That is Pharaoh and his entire crowd!” declares the Lord Yahweh. 1 And then in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, raise a lament over Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and you must say to him, ‘With a fierce, strong lion among nations you compared yourself, and you are like the sea monster in the seas, and you thrash about in your rivers, and you make water turbid with your feet, and you make your rivers muddy. 3 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Now I will spread my net over you in the assembly of many peoples, and I will bring you up in my dragnet. 4 And I will throw you on the ground; on the surface of the open field I will hurl you, and I will cause every bird of the heaven to dwell on you, and I will satisfy the animals of all of the world from you. 5 And I will put your flesh on the mountains, and I will fill the valleys with your carcass. 6 And I will water the land with your discharge from your blood on the mountains, and valleys will be filled from you. 7 And I will cover you at extinguishing your heavens, and I will make dark their stars, and I will cover the sun with the cloud, and the moon will not give its light. 8 All sources of light in the heavens, I will make them dark over you, and I will put darkness on your land,’ ” declares the Lord Yahweh. 9 “And I will disturb the hearts of many peoples at my bringing about your captivity among the nations, to countries that you do not know. 10 And I will cause many peoples to be awestruck over you, and their kings will shudder over you in horror, at my brandishing my sword before their faces, and they will tremble continually, each person for his life, on the day of your downfall.” 11 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “The sword of the king of Babylon, it will come to you. 12 By the swords of warriors I will cause to fall your hordes by the most ruthless of the nations, all of them, and they will devastate the majesty of Egypt, and all of its hordes will be destroyed. 13 And I will destroy all her domestic livestock beside many waters. The feet of humans will not make them turbid again, and the hooves of domestic livestock will not make them turbid. 14 Then I will make their waters settle, and their rivers as the olive oil I will let flow,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 15 “Then I make the land of Egypt a desolation, so that the land will be stripped from its fullness when I strike all of those dwelling in it, and they will know that I am Yahweh. 16 This is a lament, and they will chant it as a lament; the daughters of the nations will chant it as a lament over Egypt, and over all of its hordes they will chant it as a lament,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 17 And then in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 18 “Son of man, mourn over the hordes of Egypt, and make her go down, and with her the daughters of mighty nations, down to the deep underworld with the people going down to the grave. 19 You are more lovely than whom? Go down and be laid in rest with the uncircumcised. 20 In the midst of the people slain by the sword it is given they will fall to a sword; they carried her off and all of her hordes. 21 The chiefs of the warriors will speak to him from the middle of Sheol; with his helpers they have gone down; the uncircumcised lie still, those slain by the sword. 22 Assyria is there and all of its assembly; all around it are its graves, all of them killed, those fallen by the sword, 23 who will be given its graves in the remote areas of the pit, and its assembly will be all around its grave, all of them killed, fallen by the sword, those who spread terror in the land of the living. 24 Elam is there and all of its hordes, all around its grave, all of them dead who fell by the sword, those who went down uncircumcised to the depths of the underworld, those who spread their terror to the land of the living, and now they bear their disgrace with the people going down to the grave. 25 In the midst of the slain they made a bed for her with all of her hordes all around its graves, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, for their terror was spread in the land of the living, and they now bear their disgrace with the people going down to the grave; in the midst of the slain it was placed. 26 Meshech and Tubal are there and all of its hordes, all around him its graves, all of them uncircumcised and killed by the sword, for they gave their terror in the land of the living. 27 And they do not lie with warriors fallen from long ago, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and they placed their sword under their heads, and their shields were on their bones, for the terror of the warriors was in the land of the living. 28 And you too in the midst of uncircumcised people will be broken, and you will lie with those slain by the sword. 29 There is Edom, its kings and all of its leaders who are laid along with their might with those killed by the sword; they will lie with the uncircumcised and with the people going down to the grave. 30 There are also the princes of the north, all of them, all of the Sidonians who have gone down, being ashamed to lie with the slain because of their terror that they caused from their might, and they lie uncircumcised with those killed by the sword, and they bear their disgrace along with the people going down to the grave. 31 Pharaoh will see them, and he will be comforted over all of his hordes killed by the sword, Pharaoh and all of his army,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 32 “For he spread my terror in the land of the living, and so he will be laid down in the midst of the uncircumcised with those killed by the sword: Pharaoh and all of his hordes,”declares the Lord Yahweh.

Ezekiel,"1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, speak to your people, and you must say to them, ‘A land, if I bring over it a sword and the people of the land take a man, one from their number, and they appoint him for them as a watchman, 3 and he sees the sword coming against the land, and he blows on the horn and he warns the people, 4 and anyone who listens hears the sound of the horn and he does not take warning and the sword comes and it takes him, his blood will be on his own head. 5 For he heard the sound of the horn and he did not take warning; his blood will be on him. But if he took warning, he saved his life. 6 And as for the watchman, if he sees the sword coming and he does not blow the horn, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and it takes their lives, he will be taken through his guilt, but his blood from the hand of the watchman I will seek.’ 7 “And you, son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; if you hear a word from my mouth, then you must warn them from me. 8 When I say to the wicked, ‘Wicked one, you will certainly die,’ and you did not speak to warn the wicked from his way, he, the wicked, will die by his guilt, but his blood I will seek from your hand. 9 But, you, if you warn the wicked from his way, to turn from it, and he does not turn from his way, he will die by his guilt, and you will have saved your life. 10 “And you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, saying, ‘So you said, saying, “Indeed, our transgressions and our sins are on us, and because of them we are rotting, and how can we live?” ’ 11 Say to them, ‘As I live,’ declares the Lord Yahweh, ‘Surely I have no delight in the death of the wicked, except in the wicked returning from his way, and he lives. Turn back! Turn back from your ways, O evil ones, for why should you die, house of Israel?’ 12 “So you, son of man, say to your people that the righteousness of the righteous shall not save him in the day of his transgression, and the wickedness of the wicked will not cause him to stumble on the day of his returning from his wickedness; and the righteous will not be able to live by it on the day when he returns to his sin. 13 When I say to the righteous, ‘Certainly he will live,’ and he trusted in his righteousness, and he turns and he does injustice, all of his righteousness will not be remembered, and because of his injustice that he did, because of it he will die. 14 And when I say to the wicked, ‘Certainly you will die,’ but he returns from his sin and he does justice and righteousness— 15 for example, the wicked returns a pledge for a loan, he restores stolen property, he goes in the statutes of life so as not to do injustice—certainly he will live; he will not die. 16 All of his sins that he committed, they will not be remembered against him, and he did justice and righteousness; certainly he will live. 17 “Yet your people say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair!’ yet their way is not fair. 18 When the righteous turns from his righteousness and does injustice, then he will die because of it. 19 And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and he does justice and righteousness, because of it he will certainly live! 20 Yet you said, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair!’ I will judge you, house of Israel, each person according to his ways.” 21 And then it was in the twelfth year, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month of our exile, a survivor from Jerusalem came to me, saying, “The city was destroyed!” 22 And the hand of Yahweh was on me on the evening before the coming of the survivor, and he opened my mouth before the survivor came to me in the morning, and my mouth was opened, and I was no longer dumb. 23 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 24 “Son of man, the inhabitants of these ruins on the soil of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was one man, and he took possession of the land, and we are many; the land has been given for us as a possession.’ 25 Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “You eat blood in your meat, and you raise your eyes to your idols and you pour out blood, and yet you want to take possession of the land? 26 You rely on your sword, you do a detestable thing, and each man defiles the wife of his neighbor, and yet you want to take possession of the land?” ’ 27 “Thus you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “As I live, surely whoever is in the ruins, by the sword they will fall, and whoever is on the surface of the open field, I will give him to the animals to eat him, and whoever is in the stronghold and in the cave, they will die by the plague. 28 And I will make the land a desolation and a wasteland, and the pride of its strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will be desolate with no one traveling through them.” ’ 29 And they will know that I am Yahweh when I make my land a desolation and a wasteland, because of all of their detestable things that they have done. 30 “And you, son of man, your people, the ones talking together concerning you beside the walls and in the doorways of the houses, each one with his brother saying, ‘Please come and hear what is the word that is going out from Yahweh.’ 31 And they come to you as people do, and they sit before you, and my people hear your words, and they do not do them, for they are showing passion in their mouth, but their heart is going after ill-gotten gain. 32 Now, look! You are to them like a sensual song, beautiful of voice and played well on an instrument, and they hear your words, but they are not doing them. 33 So when it comes, look! It is coming!

Ezekiel,"1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and you must say to them, to the shepherds, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Woe to the shepherds of Israel who were feeding themselves! Must not the shepherds feed the flock? 3 The fat you eat, and you clothe yourself with the wool; the well-nourished animals you slaughter, but you do not feed the flock. 4 The weak you have not strengthened, and the sick you have not healed, and with respect to the hurt you have not bound them up, and you have not brought back the scattered, and you have not sought the lost, but rather you ruled over them with force and with ruthlessness. 5 And they were scattered without a shepherd, and they were as food for all the animals of the field when they were scattered. 6 My flock went astray upon all of the mountains and on every high hill, and so upon all the surface of the world my flock were scattered, and there was no one seeking them, and there was no one searching for them.” 7 Therefore, hear, O shepherds, the word of Yahweh: 8 “As I live,” declares the Lord Yahweh, “Surely because my flock have become as plunder, and my flock became as food to all the animals of the field, since there was not a shepherd, since my shepherds have not sought my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and they fed not my flock,’ ” 9 therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh, 10 ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am against the shepherds, and I will seek my flock from their hand, and I will put an end to them from shepherding flocks, and the shepherds will no longer feed themselves, and I will deliver my flocks from their mouth, so that they will not be as food for them.” 11 “ ‘For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I, even I, will seek my flock, and I will look after them, 12 just like the caring of a shepherd for his herd on the day when he is in the midst of his scattered flock. Thus I will look after my flock, and I will deliver them from all the places to which they were scattered on the day of storm and stress. 13 And I will bring them out from the peoples, and I will gather them from the countries, and I will bring them to their soil, and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the valleys, and in all of the settlements of the land. 14 I will feed them in good pasture, and their pasture will be on the mountains of the heights of Israel; there they will lie down in good pasture, and on lush pasture they will feed on the mountains of Israel. 15 I myself will feed my flock and I myself will allow them to lie down,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 16 “I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the scattered, and I will bind up the one hurt, and I will strengthen the sick; and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed her with justice.” 17 “ ‘And you, my flock, thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am judging between one sheep and another, between the rams and between the he-goats. 18 Is it not enough for you that you feed on the good pasture? And still you must trample the remainder of your pasture with your feet, and clear water you drink, and the leftover water you must make muddy with your feet. 19 And my flock must graze the pasture treaded upon by your feet, and must drink the mud puddle stirred up by your feet.” 20 “ ‘Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh to them: “Look! I, even I will judge between fat sheep and between lean sheep, 21 because with your flank and with your shoulder you shoved, and with your horns you pushed all of the sick animals until you scattered it to the outside. 22 And so I will save my flock, and they will no longer be for plunder, and I will judge between one sheep and another. 23 And I will set up over them one shepherd, and he will feed them; that is, my servant David. He will feed them, and he will be for them as a shepherd. 24 And I, Yahweh, I will be for them as God, and my servant David will be a leader in the midst of them. I, Yahweh, I have spoken. 25 And I will make them a covenant of peace, and I will put an end to wild animals from the land, and they will dwell in the desert safely, and they will sleep in the forest. 26 And I will make them and the area all around my hill a blessing, and I will let the rain go down at its appointed time; they will be rains of blessing. 27 And the tree of the field will give its fruit, and the land will give its produce, and they will be on their land safely, and they will know that I am Yahweh when I break their yoke, and I will deliver them from the hand of the ones enslaving them. 28 And they will not be any longer plunder to the nations, and the animals of the land will not eat them, and they will dwell in safety, and there will not be anyone frightening them. 29 And I will raise for them a garden plot of renown, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land, and they will not bear any more the insult of the nations. 30 And they will know that I, Yahweh their God, am with them and they are my people, the house of Israel,” declares the Lord Yahweh, 31 “and you are my flock, the flock of my pasture. You are my people; I am your God,” declares the Lord Yahweh.’ ” 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Son of man, set your face against the mountain of Seir and prophesy against it, 3 and you must say to it, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am against you, mountain of Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you a desolation and a wasteland. 4 Your cities I will make ruins, and you will be a desolation, and then you will know that I am Yahweh, 5 because there has been to you an ancient hostility, and you handed over the Israelites to the power of the sword at the time of their disaster, at the time of their final punishment. 6 Therefore as I live,” declares the Lord Yahweh, “Certainly to blood guilt I will prepare you and blood will pursue; since you did not hate blood, it will pursue you. 7 And I will make the mountain of Seir into a desolation and ruin, and I will cut off from it both he who is crossing over and he who is returning. 8 And I will fill its mountains with its slain; your hills and your valleys and all of your watercourses, the slain by the sword will fall in them. 9 An everlasting desolation I will make you, and your cities will not return, and you will know that I am Yahweh. 10 I do this because of your saying, ‘The two nations and the two lands, they will be mine, and we will take possession of it,’ and yet Yahweh was there. 11 Therefore, as I live,” declares the Lord Yahweh, “so I will deal with you according to your anger and according to your jealousy that you did, because of your hatred against them, and I will make myself known among them when I judge you. 12 And you will know that I, Yahweh, I have heard all of your contemptible words that you said against the mountains of Israel, saying, ‘They will be desolate; they are given to us as food.’ 13 And you magnified yourself against me with your insolent speech, and you spoke voluminously against me with your words—I heard! 14 Thus the Lord Yahweh says, ‘As the whole world rejoices, I will make you a desolation. 15 Like your rejoicing over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, I will do to you; you will be a desolation, mountain of Seir and all of Edom, indeed all of it; and they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” ’ 1 “And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel; and so you must say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of Yahweh; 2 thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because the enemy said concerning you, ‘Ah, and the ancient high places will be to us as a possession!’ ” ’ 3 Therefore prophesy, and you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because indeed when you were desolate, then they crushed you from all around, so that you became a possession to the remainder of the nations, and you became a byword and object of slander for the people.” 4 Therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh; thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and to the hills, to the river channels and to the valleys and to the ruins that are desolate and to the cities that are abandoned and that have become as plunder and as scorn for the remainder of the nations that are from all around. 5 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Certainly in the fire of my passion I spoke against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who made my land as a possession, because of its pastureland for plunder, for themselves in all of the joy of their whole heart and in their inner disdain.” 6 Therefore prophesy against the land of Israel, and you must say to the mountains and to the hills, to the river channels and to the valleys, thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I spoke in my passion and in my anger the insult of the peoples you have endured.” 7 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “I swear certainly that the nations that are all around you, they indeed will endure their disgrace. 8 “ ‘ “But you, mountains of Israel, your branch you will shoot, and your fruit you will carry for my people Israel, for they are soon to come. 9 For look! I am for you, and I will turn you, and you will be tilled, and you will be planted. 10 And I will cause your population to increase for you, all of the house of Israel, all of it, and the towns will be inhabited, and the ruins will be built. 11 And I will cause your population to increase for you, and domestic animals, even they will be numerous, and they will be fruitful, and I will cause you to be inhabited like your ancient times, and I will do good things more than in your former times, and you will know that I am Yahweh. 12 And I will send over you my people Israel, and they will take possession of you, and you will be for them as an inheritance, and you will no longer bereave them of their children.” 13 “ ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh, because they are saying to you, “You are an eater of humans, and you are one who makes childless your people.” 14 Therefore humans you will not eat any longer, and your nation you will not make childless any longer,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 15 “And I will not let you hear any longer the insult of the nations, and the disgrace of the peoples you will not bear any longer; you yourself will not cause your nation to stumble,” declares the Lord Yahweh.’ ” 16 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 17 “Son of man, the house of Israel, they were dwelling on their soil, and they defiled it with their way and with their deeds; like the uncleanness of menstruation was their way before me. 18 And I poured out my rage on them for the blood that they poured on the land and for their idols with which they defiled it. 19 And I scattered them among the nations, and I dispersed them in the countries according to their way, and according to their deeds I judged them. 20 And they came into the nations to which they went, and they profaned my holy name when they said to them, ‘These are the people of Yahweh, and from his land they went out.’ 21 And I was concerned for my holy name, which, the house of Israel defiled among the nations to which they went. 22 “Therefore thus say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Not for your sake am I about to act, house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you defiled among the nations to which you went. 23 And I will consecrate my great name, which was profaned among the nations and which you have profaned in the midst of them, and the nations will know that I am Yahweh!” ’ a declaration of the Lord Yahweh, when I show myself holy before their eyes. 24 “ ‘And I will take you from the nations, and I will gather you from all of the lands, and I will bring you to your land. 25 And I will sprinkle on you pure water, and you will be clean from all of your uncleanness, and I will cleanse you from all of your idols. 26 And I will give a new heart to you, and a new spirit I will give into your inner parts, and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh, and I will give to you a heart of flesh. 27 And I will give my spirit into your inner parts, and I will make it so that you will go in my rules, and my regulations you will remember, and you will do them. 28 And you will dwell in the land that I gave to your ancestors, and you will be to me as a people, and I will be to you as God. 29 And I will save you from all of your uncleanness, and I will call to the grain, and I will cause it to increase, and I will not bring famine upon you. 30 And I will cause the fruit of the tree and the crop of the field to increase, so that you will not suffer again the disgrace of famine among the nations. 31 And you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourself over your iniquities and over your detestable things. 32 But not for your sake am I acting,” declares the Lord Yahweh. “Let it be known to you, be ashamed, and be put to shame because of your ways, house of Israel. 33 “Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘On the day when I cleanse you from all of your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the ruins will be rebuilt. 34 And the land that was desolate will be cultivated in the very place that it was desolate before the eyes of all of the persons crossing over. 35 And they will say, “This desolate land has become like the garden of Eden, and the wasted and desolate and destroyed cities, now being refortified, are inhabited.” 36 And the nations who are left all around, you will know that I, Yahweh, I built that which was destroyed; I planted the desolate land; I, Yahweh, I have spoken, and I will act.’ 37 “Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Again this time I will let myself be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do something for them; I will cause them to increase their population like a flock. 38 Like the flock of the sanctuary, like the flock of Jerusalem at its festival, so the desolate cities will be filled with flocks of people;

A rattling, and they came together—the bones! Bone to its bone! 8 And I looked, and indeed, sinews were on them, and flesh went up, and skin covered over them upward, but breath was not in them. 9 And he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and you must say to the breath, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh from the four winds, “Come, O spirit and breath, on these dead ones, so that they may live!” ’ ” 10 And I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they became alive, and they stood on their feet, a very, very large group. 11 And he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are all of the house of Israel; look! they are saying, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is destroyed; we are cut off as far as we are concerned.’ 12 Therefore prophesy, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look!

I am against you, Gog, the head leader of Meshach and Tubal, 4 and I will turn you around, and I will place hooks in your cheeks, and I will bring you out and all of your horses and horsemen fully armed, all of them, a great crowd, holding a shield, and small shield, and holding swords, all of them. 5 Persia, Cush, and Put are with them, all of them, with a small shield and helmet. 6 Gomer and all of its troops, Beth Togarmah, the remote areas of the north, and with all of its troops and many peoples with them. 7 Be ready, and prepare yourselves, you and all of your assembly, the assembling around you, and you must be for them as a guard. 8 After many days you will be mustered; in the last years you will come to a restored land from the sword, gathered from many peoples on the mountains of Israel which were as permanent ruins but from peoples it was brought out, and they will dwell in safety, all of them. 9 And you will advance like a storm; you will come, and you will be like a cloud covering the land, and all of your troops and many nations along with you.” 10 “ ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “And then on that day, things will come up on your mind, and you will devise evil plans. 11 And you will say, ‘I will go up against a land of open country; I will come to the people being at rest in safety, all of them dwelling without a wall and crossbars and without doors, 12 to loot loot, and to plunder plunder, to assail inhabited ruins and a people gathered together from various peoples and who are acquiring livestock and goods and dwelling at the center of the world. 13 Sheba and Dedan and traders of Tarshish and all its strong lions, they will ask you, ‘To loot loot are you coming? To plunder plunder have you summoned your assembly, to take away silver and gold, to take livestock and goods, to loot great amounts of loot?” ’ 14 “Therefore prophesy, son of man, and you must say to Gog, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Will you not realize on that day when my people Israel are dwelling in safety, 15 and so you will come from your place, from the remote areas of the north, you and many people with you, horsemen all of them, a great crowd and a vast army, 16 and you will advance against my people Israel like a cloud covering the land; it will be in the last days, and I will bring you against my land, so that the nations know me, when I show myself holy through you before their eyes, O Gog!” ’ 17 “Thus says the Lord Yahweh, ‘Are you he of whom I spoke in former days by the hand of my servants the prophets of Israel who were prophesying in those days for years that I would bring you against them? 18 And so then in that day, on the day of the coming of God against the land of Israel,’ declares the Lord Yahweh, ‘my rage will come up in my anger. 19 And in my passion, in the fire of my wrath, I spoke that certainly on that day a great earthquake will be on the land of Israel. 20 And the fish of the sea and the birds of the heaven and the animals of the field and all of the creeping things that creep on the earth and all of the humans who are on the surface of the earth will shake at my presence; and the mountains will be demolished, and the steep mountain sides will fall, and every wall on the earth will fall. 21 And I will call against him in all of my mountains a sword,’ declares the Lord Yahweh, ‘And the sword of each person will be against his brother. 22 And I will execute justice with him with a plague and with blood and torrents of rain, and hailstones; fire and sulfur I will cause to fall on him and on his troops and on many peoples who are with him. 23 And so I will exalt myself, and I will show myself holy, and I will make myself known before the eyes of many nations, and they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 1 “And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I am against you Gog, the head leader of Meshech and Tubal, 2 and I will turn you around, and I will drag you along, and I will bring you up from the remote areas of the north, and I will bring you against the mountains of Israel, 3 and I will strike your bow from your left hand, and your arrows from your right hand I will cause to fall. 4 On the mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all of your troops, and the peoples who are with you, to birds of prey, birds of every wing, and animals of the field I will give you as food. 5 On the surface of the field you will fall, for I myself have spoken,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 6 “And I will send fire against Magog and among the people inhabiting the coastlands in safety, and they will know that I am Yahweh. 7 And my holy name I will make known in the midst of my people Israel, and I will not let the name of my holiness be profaned anymore, and the nations will know that I am Yahweh, the holy one in Israel. 8 Look! it is coming, and it will happen,” declares the Lord Yahweh. “It is the day about which I have spoken. 9 “‘“And the inhabitants of the towns of Israel will go out, and they will set ablaze, and they will kindle a fire with a weapon and a small shield and a shield, with a bow and with arrows, and with hand clubs and with spears, and so they will light a fire with them, a fire lasting seven years. 10 And they will not carry trees from the field, and they will not chop wood from the forests, for with the weapons they will light a fire; and they will plunder those plundering them, and they will plunder those plundering them,” ’ declares the Lord Yahweh. 11 “ ‘ “And then on that day I will give to Gog a grave there in Israel, The Valley of the Travelers, east of the sea, and it will block the travelers and Gog and all of his hordes they will bury there, and they will call it the Valley of Hamon-Gog. 12 And the house of Israel will bury them for seven months to cleanse the land. 13 All of the people of the land will bury them, and it will be an honor for them on the day when I appear,” ’ declares the Lord Yahweh. 14 ‘“And they will set apart men to continually go through the land burying the travelers, the ones left over on the surface of the land to cleanse it; for the whole of seven months they will explore it. 15 And the ones going through, they will go through within the land, and if anyone sees the bones of a person, then he will build beside it a sign to remain until the buriers have buried him in the Valley of Hamon-Gog. 16 And furthermore the name of the city there is Hamonah, and thus they will cleanse the land.” ’ 17 “And you, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Say to all kinds of birds and animals of the field, “Be gathered, come be gathered from everywhere to my sacrifice that I am sacrificing for you, a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, and you will eat flesh, and you will drink blood. 18 Flesh of warriors you will eat, and the blood of leaders of the land you will drink; rams, young rams and goats, bulls, and the fattened animals of Bashan—all of them! 19 And you will eat fat until you are satiated, and you will drink blood until you are drunk from my sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, 20 and you will be satisfied at my table with horse and horsemen and warriors and every man of war,” ’ declares the Lord Yahweh. 21 “And I will display my glory among the nations, and all of the nations will see my judgment that I have executed and my hand that I have laid upon them. 22 “And the house of Israel will know that I am Yahweh their God from that day and beyond, 23 and the nations will know that because of their guilt the house of Israel went into exile, because they acted unfaithfully against me, and I hid my face from them, and I gave them into the hand of their foes, and they fell by the sword, all of them. 24 According to their uncleanness and according to their transgression I dealt with them, and I hid my face from them. 25 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob, and I will have compassion on all of the house of Israel, and I will be jealous for my holy name. 26 And they will forget their disgrace and all of their infidelity that they displayed against me when they dwelt on their soil in safety with nobody making them afraid. 27 When I restore them from the nations and I gather them from the countries of their enemies, then I will show myself holy through them before the eyes of many nations. 28 And they will know that I am Yahweh their God, because of when I deported them into the nations, and I reassembled them to their soil, and I will not let any of them remain there any longer. 29 And I will not hide my face again from them when I pour out my Spirit over the house of Israel,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 1 In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was destroyed, in this day exactly, the hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me there 2 in visions from God. He brought me to the land of Israel and put me on a very high mountain, and on it was something like a structure of a city to the south. 3 And he brought me there, and look, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, and a cord of linen was in his hand and a reed for measurement; he was standing in the gate. 4 And the man spoke to me, “Son of man, look with your eyes and listen with your ears and apply your heart to all that I am showing you, for you were brought here in order to show you this; tell all that you are seeing to the house of Israel.” 5 And there was a wall on the outside of the temple all the way around it, and in the hand of the man the reed for measurement was six long cubits, according to the cubit and a handbreadth, and he measured the width of the outer wall as one reed, and the height as one reed. 6 And then he went toward the gate whose face was to the east. And he went up by its steps, and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed wide. 7 And the alcove was one reed long and one reed wide, and between the alcoves was five cubits, and the threshold of the gate along the side of the portico of the gate on the inside was one reed. 8 And then he measured the portico of the gate on the inside as one reed. 9 And he measured the portico of the gate as eight cubits, and its pilaster was two cubits thick, and he measured the portico of the gate on the inside. 10 And the alcoves of the gate toward the way eastward were three on each side; the same measurements applied to all three of them; and the same measurement applied to the pilaster on each side. 11 And he measured the width of the doorway of the gate as ten cubits and the length of the gateway was thirteen cubits. 12 And a wall was before the alcoves; one cubit on either side was the wall from here. And the alcove was six cubits on each side. 13 And he measured the gate from the top slab of the alcove to its opposite top slab as twenty-five cubits in width, from one entrance to the other one opposite it. 14 And he made the pilasters sixty cubits, and to the pilaster of the courtyard all the way around the gate. 15 And from the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the portico of the inner gate was fifty cubits. 16 And there were narrow windows for the alcoves and for their pilasters to the inside of the gate all the way around it. And likewise with respect to the porticos and windows were all the way around to the inside, and on a pilaster there were images of palm trees. 17 And he brought me to the outer courtyard, and there were chambers and a pavement made for the courtyard all around it, and thirty chambers were facing to the pavement. 18 And the pavement flanked the side of the gates and all along the gates; this describes the lower pavement. 19 And he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the outside of the inner courtyard as a hundred cubits to the east and to the north. 20 And as for the gate that had its face toward the north of the outer courtyard, he measured its length and its width. 21 And its alcoves were three on each side, and its pilasters and its porticos had the same measurement as the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and its width was twenty-five cubits. 22 And its windows and its porticos and its palm tree images were like the measurement of the gate that was facing toward the east; and it had seven steps that go up it, and there were porticos before them. 23 And a gate led to the inner courtyard, opposite the gate to the north and to the east, and he measured from gate to gate as a hundred cubits. 24 And then he took me toward the south, and look, a gate toward the south, and he measured its pilasters and its porticos; they had measurements just like the others. 25 And there were for it windows and for its porticos all the way around it like these windows; fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. 26 And seven steps were going up to it and its porticos before them. And it had palm tree images all along its pilasters. 27 And there was to the way of the south a gate for the inner courtyard, and he measured from gate to the gate on the way of the south, a hundred cubits. 28 And he brought me to the inner courtyard through the gate of the south, and he measured the south gate, and it had measurements like the others. 29 And its alcoves and its pilasters and its porticos were just like these measurements. And it had windows for it and for its porticos all the way around, fifty cubits along its length, and twenty-five cubits wide. 30 And there were porticos all the way around its length, twenty-five cubits; and its width was five cubits. 31 And its porticos were to the outer courtyard, and palm tree images were on its pilasters, and eight steps were for its stairs. 32 And he brought me to the inner courtyard by way of the east gate, and he measured the gate as just like the other measurements. 33 And its alcoves and its pilasters and its porticos were also like these measurements, and windows were for it and for its porticos all around; its length was fifty cubits, and it was twenty-five cubits wide. 34 And its porticos were toward the outer courtyard, and palm tree images were on its pilasters one each side, and eight steps served as it stairs. 35 And he brought me to the gate of the north, and he measured it; and he measured the same measurements as these others, 36 its alcoves, its pilasters and porticos, and its windows all the way around, and a length of fifty cubits and twenty-five cubits wide. 37 And its pilasters faced the outer courtyard, and it had palm tree images on its pilasters on each side; and eight steps served as its stairs. 38 And a chamber with its doorway was in the pilasters at the gates, and there they rinsed off the burnt offering. 39 And in the portico of the gate were two tables on each side to slaughter the burnt offering on them and the sin offering and the guilt offering. 40 And on the outer side as one goes up to the doorway of the gate to the north were two tables, and on the other side, which is toward the portico of the gate, were two tables. 41 On each side of the gate were four tables, eight tables in all, and on them they slaughtered sacrifices. 42 And four tables were for the burnt offering, and made of dressed stones, one cubit and a half long and one cubit and a half wide and one cubit high was their measurements, and they placed the objects with which they slaughtered the burnt offering on them and the sacrifice. 43 And there were double-pronged hooks, one handbreadth in width, put in place in the house all around, and on the tables was the flesh of the offering. 44 And on the outside of the inner gate, there were chambers for singers in the inner courtyard, which was to the side of the north gate, and their faces were to the south with respect to one, and on the side of the east gate one facing to the north. 45 And he said to me, “This chamber with its face toward the south is for the priests who are taking care of the responsibility of the temple. 46 And the chamber with its face to the north is for the priests who are taking care of the responsibility of the altar. They are the descendants of Zadok, the ones who approach from among the descendants of Levi to Yahweh to serve him.” 47 And he measured the courtyard as to its length, a hundred cubits, and a hundred cubits wide, squared, and the altar is in front of the temple. 48 And he brought me to the portico of the temple, and he measured the pilaster of the portico, five cubits on each side, and the width of the gate was three cubits on each side. 49 The length of the portico was twenty cubits and its width eleven cubits, and with ten steps they went up to it, and the pilasters had pillars, one on each side.

Before the threshold was a covering of wood all around, and from the ground up to the windows, and all around the windows, they were covered. 17 Above the doorway and up to the inner temple and on the outside, and on all of the wall all the way around in the inner and in the outer areas were patterns, 18 and it was made of cherubim and palm tree images; a palm tree image between cherub and cherub, and the cherub had two faces. 19 And the face of a human was toward the palm tree image on the one side, and the face of a fierce strong lion faced the palm tree image on the other side; this work was executed for the entire temple all the way around. 20 From the ground up to above the doorway, the cherubim and the palm tree images were made, and also the outer wall of the temple. 21 As far as the temple is concerned its doorframe was squared, and before the sanctuary was the appearance as it were the appearance of 22 a wooden altar that was three cubits high, and its length was two cubits, and its corners for it and its length and its walls were of wood. And he spoke to me, “This is the table that is before Yahweh.” 23 And the two doors were for the temple and for the sanctuary. 24 And two leaves of a door were for each of the doors, two hinged leaves of a door: two were for the first door, and two leaves of a door were for the other door. 25 And cherubim were made on them, that is, on the doors of the temple and palm tree images like the ones prepared for the walls; and an overhang of wood was on the surface of the porticos on the outside. 26 And narrow windows and palm tree images were on either side, and on the side walls of the portico, and the side rooms of the temple and their overhang. 1 And he brought me out to the outer courtyard to the north, and he brought me to the chamber which was opposite the courtyard and which is opposite the building to the north. 2 As to the face of the length of the building with the doorway to the north, it was a hundred cubits, and its width was fifty cubits. 3 Opposite the twenty cubits of the inner courtyard, and opposite the pavement that was to the outer courtyard was a gallery facing a gallery in the three stories. 4 And in front of the chambers was a passageway ten cubits in width toward the inside, a walkway of one cubit, and their doorways were to the north. 5 And the upper chambers narrowed, for the galleries took away space from them more than they took from the lower levels and more than they took from the middle level in the building. 6 For they were three stories and they had no pillars like the pillars of the courtyards; therefore they were smaller than the lower stories and than the middle stories from the ground up. 7 And there was a wall that was to the outside alongside the chambers on the walkway to the outer courtyard in front of the chambers; its length was fifty cubits. 8 For the length of the chambers which were to the outer courtyard was fifty cubits, and look! The chambers on the front of the temple were a hundred cubits. 9 And from under these chambers was the entrance from the east for them when one enters from the outer courtyard. 10 All along the width of the wall of the courtyard eastward in front of the courtyard to the front of the building were chambers. 11 And a walkway was before them like the appearance of the chambers which were on the north, just like them in their length, and so was their width and all their exits, and they were built like their arrangements and like their doorways, 12 and like the doorways of the chambers which were on the way of the south was a doorway at the head of the way before the stone wall, projecting on the way of the east at their coming. 13 And he said to me, “The chambers of the north and the chambers of the south which are before the courtyard, they are the holy chambers in which the priests, who are near to Yahweh, will eat the most holy objects. There they shall put the most holy objects, and the grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering, for the place is holy. 14 When the priests enter, then they shall not go out from the sanctuary to the outer courtyard; and there they must put their garments in which they serve because they are holy. They must put on other garments and then they may approach the area that is for the people. 15 And he completed the measurements of the inner temple, and he brought me to the walkway of the gate that faces toward the east and he measured it all the way around. 16 He measured the east side with the reed for measuring, five hundred cubits, with respect to reeds with the reed for measurement, he measured it all around. 17 He measured the north side as five hundred cubits, with respect to reeds with the reed for measurement all around. 18 Then he measured the south side as five hundred cubits, with respect to reeds with the reed for measurement. 19 He went around the west side and he measured five hundred cubits, with respect to reeds with the reed for measurement. 20 Toward the four sides he measured it; there was a wall for it all the way around. Its length was five hundred cubits and its width was five hundred cubits, in order to make a separation between what is holy and what is common. 1 And he brought me to the gate which was facing east. 2 And, look! The glory of the God of Israel, it came from the way of the east, and its sound was like the sound of many waters and the land radiated due to his glory! 3 And the appearance of the vision which I saw was as the vision which I saw at his coming to destroy the city, and these visions were also as the vision which I saw by the Kebar River, and I fell on my face. 4 And then the glory of Yahweh came to the temple by the way of the gate facing east. 5 And the Spirit lifted me and it brought me to the inner courtyard and, look! The glory of Yahweh filled the temple! 6 And I heard someone speaking to me from the house, and a man was standing beside me. 7 And he said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet where I will dwell in the midst of the Israelites to eternity, and they, the house of Israel, they and their kings, will not again defile my holy name with their fornication and with their offerings for the dead of their kings on their high places. 8 When they placed their threshold with my threshold, their doorframe beside my doorframe and the wall was between me and between them, then they defiled my holy name, with their detestable things that they did, and so I consumed them in my anger. 9 Now let them send their fornication far away and the offerings for the dead of their kings away from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them forever. 10 You, son of man, describe to the house of Israel the temple and let them be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the pattern. 11 And if they are ashamed of all that they did, then the plan of the temple and its arrangement and its exits and its entrances and all of its plans and all of its statutes. And all of its plans and all of its laws make known to them and write them before their eyes, so that they may remember all of its plans and all of its statutes, so that they do them! 12 This is the law of the temple: On the top of the mountain, all of its territory, all the way around it, will be most holy. Look, this is the law of the temple. 13 And these are the measurements of the altar in the cubits (a cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): now its gutter is a cubit in depth by a cubit in width and its rim along its edge all around is one span, and this is also the height of the altar. 14 And from the gutter at the ground up to the lower ledge is two cubits, and its width is one cubit, and from the small ledge up to the large ledge is four cubits, and its width is one cubit. 15 And the altar hearth was four cubits, and from the altar hearth and upwards were the four horns of the altar. 16 And the altar hearth was twelve cubits in length and twelve cubits in width; it was squared on its four sides. 17 And the ledge was fourteen cubits in length with fourteen cubits its width to all four of its sides, and a rim was all around it of one-half cubit. And the gutter for it was a cubit all around, and its steps were facing east.” 18 And he said to me, “Son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘These are the statutes of the altar on the day when it is made, to sacrifice a burnt offering on it and to sprinkle blood on it. 19 And you must give to the Levitical priests who are from the offspring of Zadok, the ones coming near me,” declares the Lord Yahweh, “to serve me, a bull, a calf as a sin offering. 20 You must take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, and the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim all around; thus you must purify it and make atonement for it. 21 And you must take the bull, the sin offering, and you must burn it in the designated place of the temple outside of the holy place. 22 And on the second day you must offer a he-goat without defect as a sin offering, and they must purify the altar like they purified with the bull. 23 When you are finished from purifying, you must offer a bull, a calf, without defect, and a ram from the flock without defect. 24 And you must bring them near before Yahweh, and the priests must throw salt on them, and they must offer them as a burnt offering to Yahweh. 25 For seven days you must provide a goat of sin offering for the day and a bull, a calf, and a ram from the flock without defect; you must provide them. 26 Seven days they must purify the altar and they must cleanse it and so they will consecrate it. 27 And they will finish the days, and then on the eighth day and beyond that the priests will offer on the altar your burnt offerings and your fellowship offerings, and then I will be pleased with you,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 1 And he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary that is facing east, and it was shut. 2 And Yahweh said to me, “This gate will be shut. It shall not be opened, and no one will go through it, for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has entered it, and it will be shut. 3 The prince, he may sit in it to eat food before Yahweh; he will come from the way of the portico of the gate and by means of its way he will also go out.” 4 Then he brought me by the way of the gate of the north to the front of the temple, and I looked, and look! The glory of Yahweh filled the temple of Yahweh, and I fell on my face. 5 And Yahweh said, “Son of man, set your heart and look with your eyes and with your ears hear everything I am saying to you concerning all the statutes of the temple of Yahweh and concerning all its laws, and you must listen with your heart concerning the entrance of the temple with all of the exits of the sanctuary. 6 And you must say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Enough for you, house of Israel, of all of your detestable things! 7 At your bringing foreigners who are uncircumcised of heart and uncircumcised of flesh to be in my sanctuary to profane it, my temple, as you offered my food, fat, and blood, so you broke my covenant by all of your detestable things. 8 And you did not observe the responsibility of my sanctuary, but you appointed them as the keepers of my responsibility in my sanctuary for you.” 9 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Every foreigner uncircumcised of heart and uncircumcised of flesh shall not come into my sanctuary—not any of the foreigners who are in the midst of the Israelites. 10 But the Levites who removed themselves from me at the going astray of Israel, who went astray from me and went after their idols, as a result they will bear their guilt. 11 Then they will be in my sanctuary, those serving in my sanctuary, as sentries at the gates of the temple and as those serving the temple; they will slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they will stand before them to serve them, 12 because they used to serve them before their idols and they were for the house of Israel like a stumbling block of iniquity. Therefore I swore concerning them,” declares the Lord Yahweh, “that they will bear their iniquity. 13 And they shall not approach me to serve as a priest for me and to come near to all of my holy objects, to the most holy objects, and they will bear their disgrace and the results of their detestable things they have done. 14 And I will appoint them as the keepers of the responsibility of the temple, for all of its work and everything which will be done in it. 15 But the Levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok, who cared for the responsibility of my sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from me, they will approach me to serve me, and they will stand before me to offer to me fat and blood,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 16 “They shall come to my sanctuary, and they shall approach my table to serve me, and they will observe my requirement. 17 And then when they come to the gates of the inner courtyards, they shall put on their inner linen garments and not wear wool garments when they serve in the gates of the inner courtyard and inside the temple. 18 Linen turbans shall be on their head and linen undergarments shall be on their waists; they shall not gird themselves with material causing perspiration. 19 When they go out to the outer courtyard to the people, they must take off their garment in which they were serving, and they must place them in the holy chambers, and they must put on other garments, so that they will not make the people holy with their garments. 20 And their head they shall not shave, or long hair they shall not let grow; short they shall clip their heads. 21 And no priest shall drink wine when they come into the inner courtyard. 22 And a widow or divorced woman they shall not take for themselves as wives, but only a virgin from the offspring of the house of Israel, or the widow who is a widow for a priest they may take. 23 And they will teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is unholy, and the difference between unclean and clean they must show them. 24 And at a legal dispute they themselves shall stand to judge; employing my judgments they shall judge it, and with respect to my laws and my statutes. All my festivals they shall keep and my Sabbaths they shall consecrate. 25 And near a dead person he shall not come to be defiled, but only for a father and for a mother and for a son and for a daughter, for a brother and for a sister who was not married may they defile themselves. 26 And, after his cleansing, they shall count for him seven days, 27 and then on the day of his coming into the sanctuary to the inner courtyard to serve in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 28 And thus it will be to them as regards inheritance, that I am their inheritance, and so you shall not give to them property in Israel; I am their property. 29 The grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering, they themselves may eat them, and also all the consecrated possessions in Israel will be theirs. 30 And also what is first of all of the firstfruits of everything, and of all of the contribution of everything from all of your contributions, to the priest it belongs, and what is first of your dough you shall give to the priest, so that a blessing may rest on your house. 31 Any dead body or mangled carcass from the birds or from the animals, the priests shall not eat.” 1 And when you allocate the land as an inheritance, you shall provide a contribution for Yahweh as a holy portion from the land, its length being twenty-five thousand cubits and its width ten thousand cubits; it is holy in all its territory, all around. 2 And there shall be from this area five hundred cubits by five hundred cubits, squared all around, for the sanctuary; and fifty cubits of open space shall be for it all around it. 3 And from this measured area you shall measure a length of twenty-five thousand cubits and a width of ten thousand cubits, and in it will be the sanctuary, the most holy place. 4 It is a holy portion from the land; it will be for the priests, the servants of the sanctuary who approach to serve Yahweh, and it will be for them a place for houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. 5 And an area twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand cubits in width will be for the Levites, the servants of the temple. It will serve as property for them as cities to dwell in. 6 And as property of the city, you must set apart alongside the contribution of the sanctuary a portion five thousand cubits in width and twenty-five thousand cubits in length, and it shall be for the entire house of Israel. 7 And a portion will be for the prince on both sides of the holy district, and both sides of the property of the city, and alongside the property of the city on the west, and alongside the property on the east. And also its length corresponds to one of the tribal portions to the west running to the eastern border. 8 This shall be to him with respect to the land as property in Israel; and so my princes shall not again oppress my people, but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.” 9 Thus says the Lord Yahweh, “Enough of this for you, the princes of Israel; put away violence and destruction and do justice and righteousness; revoke your acts of dispossession from upon my people!” declares the Lord Yahweh. 10 There shall be for you an honest set of scales and an honest ephah and an honest bath. 11 The ephah and the bath shall be one unit of measurement; the tenth part of the homer is the bath, and the tenth of the homer is the ephah; so the homer shall be its unit of measurement. 12 And the shekel shall weigh twenty gerahs, twenty shekels and five and twenty shekels and ten and five shekels, that shall make the mina for you. 13 This is the contribution offering which you shall present: a sixth of the ephah from a homer of wheat, and a sixth of the ephah from a homer of barley. 14 And the quota of the olive oil, the bath of the olive oil, is the tenth part of a bath from a kor, which is ten baths, or a homer—for ten baths are equal to a homer. 15 And one sheep from the flock from among two hundred from the pastures of Israel will be taken as a grain offering and as a burnt offering and as a fellowship offering to make atonement for them,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 16 “All of the people of the land shall join in to this contribution with the prince in Israel. 17 “But on the prince shall be the responsibility for the burnt offerings, and the grain offering, and the libation at the feasts, and at the New Moon festivals, and at the Sabbaths at all of the assemblies of the house of Israel; he shall provide the sin offering, and the grain offering, and the burnt offering, and the fellowship offering to make atonement for the house of Israel. 18 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘On the first month on the first day of the month, you shall take a bull, a calf without defect, and you shall purify the sanctuary. 19 And the priest shall take from the blood of the sin offering, and he shall put it on the doorframe of the temple and on the four corners of the ledge of the altar and on the doorframe of the gate of the inner courtyard. 20 And so you shall do on the seventh day in the month for anyone doing wrong inadvertently or due to ignorance, and so you must make atonement for the temple. 21 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have the Passover, a feast lasting for seven days, when you shall eat unleavened breads. 22 And the prince shall provide on that day for himself and for all of the people of the land a bull as a sin offering. 23 And during the seven days of the religious feast he shall provide as a burnt offering to Yahweh seven bulls and seven rams without defect for each of the seven days, and as a sin offering a he-goat for each day. 24 And as a grain offering, an ephah for the bull and an ephah for the ram he must provide, and a hin of olive oil for each ephah. 25 In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, during the feast, he shall provide just as he has for these seven days, as he did for the sin offering, as he did for the burnt offering, and as he did for the grain offering, and as he did for the olive oil.’ ” ",Ezekiel 40-48,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ezekiel-40-48-62617/direct-download/tbd20090930.mp3

1 Timothy,"18 I am setting before you this instruction, Timothy my child, in accordance with the prophecies spoken long ago about you, in order that by them you may fight the good fight, 19 having faith and a good conscience, which some, because they have rejected these, have suffered shipwreck concerning their faith, 20 among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, in order that they may be taught not to blaspheme. 1 Therefore, I urge first of all that petitions, prayers, requests, and thanksgiving be made on behalf of all people, 2 on behalf of kings and all those who are in authority, in order that we may live a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. 3 This is good and acceptable before God our Savior, 4 who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. 5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and human beings, the man Christ Jesus, ",1 Timothy 1:18-2:5,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-timothy-118-25-62577/direct-download/tbd20090805.mp3

1 Timothy,"8 Deacons likewise must be dignified, not insincere, not devoted to much wine, not fond of dishonest gain, 9 holding the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience, 10 and these also must be tested first; then let them serve if they are above reproach. 11 The wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderous, temperate, faithful in all things. 12 Deacons must be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households well. 13 For those who have served well acquire a good standing for themselves, and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. 14 I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you in a short time. 15 But if I am delayed, I am writing in order that you may know how one must conduct oneself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and mainstay of the truth. 16 And most certainly, great is the mystery of godliness: Who was revealed in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among the Gentiles, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.

1 Timothy,"16 And most certainly, great is the mystery of godliness: Who was revealed in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among the Gentiles, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory. 1 Now the Spirit explicitly says that in the last times some will depart from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, 2 by the hypocrisy of liars, who are seared in their own conscience, 3 who forbid marrying and insist on abstaining from foods that God created for sharing in with thankfulness by those who believe and who know the truth, 4 because everything created by God is good and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thankfulness, 5 for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer. 6 By teaching these things to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, trained in the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed faithfully.

1 Timothy,"1 Do not rebuke an older man, but appeal to him as a father, younger men as brothers, 2 older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with all purity. 3 Honor widows who are truly widows. 4 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must learn to show profound respect for their own household first, and to pay back recompense to their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God. 5 But the widow who is one truly, and is left alone, has put her hope in God and continues in her petitions and prayers night and day. 6 But the one who lives for sensual pleasure is dead even though she lives. 7 And command these things, in order that they may be irreproachable. 8 But if someone does not provide for his own relatives, and especially the members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. 9 Let a widow be put on the list if she is not less than sixty years old, the wife of one husband, 10 being well-attested by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has helped those who are oppressed, if she has devoted herself to every good work. 11 But refuse younger widows, for whenever their physical desires lead them away from Christ, they want to marry, 12 thus incurring condemnation because they have broken their former pledge. 13 And at the same time also, going around from house to house, they learn to be idle, and not only idle, but also gossipy and busybodies, saying the things that are not necessary. 14 Therefore I want younger widows to marry, to bear children, to manage a household, to give the adversary no opportunity for reproach. 15 For already some have turned away and followed after Satan. 16 If any believing woman has widows, she must help them, and the church must not be burdened, in order that it may help those who are truly widows. 17 The elders who lead well must be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor by speaking and teaching. 18 For the scripture says, “You must not muzzle an ox while it is threshing,” and “The worker is worthy of his wages.” 19 Do not accept an accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses.

1 Timothy,"19 Do not accept an accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. 20 Reprove those who sin in the presence of all, in order that the rest also may experience fear. 21 I testify solemnly before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing according to partiality. 22 Lay hands on no one hastily, and do not participate in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. 23 (No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach and your frequent illnesses.) 24 The sins of some people are evident, preceding them to judgment, but for some also they follow after them. 25 Likewise also good works are evident, and those considered otherwise are not able to be hidden. 1 All those who are under the yoke as slaves must regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, lest the name of God and the teaching be slandered. 2 And those who have believing masters must not look down on them because they are brothers, but rather they must serve, because those who benefit by their service are believers and dearly loved. Teach and encourage these things. 3 If anyone teaches other doctrine and does not devote himself to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness, 4 he is conceited, understanding nothing, but having a morbid interest concerning controversies and disputes about words, from which come envy, strife, slanders, evil suspicions, 5 constant wrangling by people of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who consider godliness to be a means of gain. 6 But godliness with contentment is a great means of gain. 7 For we have brought nothing into the world, so that neither can we bring anything out. 8 But if we have food and clothing, with these things we will be content. 9 But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and a trap and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge those people into ruin and destruction. 10 For the love of money is a root of all evil, by which some, because they desire it, have gone astray from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains. 11 But you, O man of God, flee from these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patient endurance, gentleness. 12 Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 13 I command you, in the sight of God who gives life to all things and Christ Jesus who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, 14 that you observe the commandment without fault, irreproachable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 which he will make known in his own time, the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords, 16 the one who alone possesses immortality, who lives in unapproachable light, whom no human being has seen nor is able to see, to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen. 17 Command those who are rich in this present age not to be proud and not to put their hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in God, who provides us all things richly for enjoyment, 18 to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, sharing freely, 19 storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, in order that they may take hold of what is truly life. 20 O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Turn away from pointless empty talk and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge, 21 which some, by professing it, have deviated concerning the faith. Grace be with you all.

Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 3 I am thankful to God, whom I have served with a clear conscience as my ancestors did, when I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day, 4 longing to see you as I remember your tears, so that I may be filled with joy, 5 remembering the sincere faith in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced that is in you also, 6 for which reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands.

2 Timothy,"6 for which reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands. 7 For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and love and self-discipline. 8 Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor me his prisoner, but suffer along with me for the gospel, according to the power of God, 9 who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace that was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began, 10 but has now been disclosed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and brought to light life and immortality through the gospel, 11 for which I was appointed a proclaimer and an apostle and a teacher, 12 for which reason also I suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, because I know in whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted until that day. 13 Hold fast to the pattern of sound words which you heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 14 Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who lives in us. 15 You know this, that all those in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he refreshed me many times, and was not ashamed of my imprisonment, 17 but when he was in Rome, he diligently sought me and found me. 18 May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day! And how much he served me in Ephesus you know very well.

2 Timothy,"1 You, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, 2 and the things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these things to faithful people who will be competent to teach others also. 3 Suffer together with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 4 No one who serves as a soldier is entangled in the activities of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him. 5 And also if anyone competes he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 6 The farmer who works hard must be the first to receive a share of the crops. 7 Consider what I am saying, for the Lord will grant you understanding in all these things. 8 Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David according to my gospel, 9 in connection with which I suffer misfortune to the point of imprisonment as a criminal, but the word of God is not bound. 10 Because of this, I endure all things for the sake of the chosen, in order that they also may obtain salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 11 The saying is trustworthy: For if we died with him, we will also live with him; 12 if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us; 13 if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful—he cannot deny himself.

This is in no way beneficial and leads to the ruin of the hearers. 15 Make every effort to present yourself approved to God, a worker having no need to be ashamed, guiding the word of truth along a straight path. 16 But avoid pointless chatter, for it will progress to greater ungodliness, 17 and their message will spread like gangrene, among whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 18 who have deviated concerning the truth by saying the resurrection has already taken place, and they are upsetting the faith of some. 19 However, the solid foundation of God stands firm, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and “Everyone who names the name of the Lord must abstain from unrighteousness.” 20 Now in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthenware ones, some of which are for honorable use, and some of which are for ordinary use. 21 Therefore, if someone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work. 22 But flee from youthful desires, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in company with those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart. 23 But avoid foolish and uninformed controversies, because you know that they produce quarrels. 24 And the slave of the Lord must not quarrel, but be kind toward everyone, skillful in teaching, tolerant, 25 correcting those who are opposed with gentleness, seeing whether perhaps God may grant them repentance to a knowledge of the truth, 26 and they will come to their senses again and escape from the trap of the devil, being held captive by him to do his will.

2 Timothy,"1 But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come, 2 for people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, slanderers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3 hardhearted, irreconcilable, slanderous, without self-control, savage, with no interest for what is good, 4 traitors, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure rather than loving God, 5 maintaining a form of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid these people. 6 For from these are those who slip into houses and captivate foolish women loaded down with sins, led by various kinds of desires, 7 always learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth. 8 And just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these oppose the truth, people corrupted in mind, disqualified concerning the faith. 9 But they will not progress to a greater extent, for their folly will be quite evident to everyone, as also the folly of those two was. 10 But you have faithfully followed my teaching, way of life, purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, 11 persecutions, and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, and in Lystra, what sort of persecutions I endured, and the Lord delivered me from all of them. 12 And indeed, all those who want to live in a godly manner in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.

Lamentations,"1 How desolate the city sits that was full of people! She has become like a widow, once great among the nations! Like a woman of nobility in the provinces, she has become a forced laborer. 2 She weeps bitterly in the night, her tears are on her cheeks; she has no comforter among all her lovers. All her friends have been unfaithful to her; they have become her enemies. 3 Judah has gone into exile with misery and under hard servitude; she lives among the nations, she has not found a resting place; all her pursuers have overtaken her amidst her distress. 4 The roads of Zion are mourning because no one comes to the festival. All her gates are desolate, her priests groan; her young women are worried, and she herself suffers bitterly. 5 Her foes have become her master, her enemies are at ease; Yahweh has made her suffer because of the greatness of her transgressions. Her children have gone away, captive before the foe. 6 All her majesty has gone away from the daughter of Zion; her princes have become like young stags that have not found pasture; they have gone away without strength, before the pursuer. 7 Jerusalem remembers the days of her misery and wanderings, all her treasures that were from the days of long ago. When her people fell into the hand of the enemy, there was no one helping her; the enemies saw her, they mocked at her destruction. 8 Jerusalem sinned grievously, thus she became an objection of derision; all those who honored her despise her because they have seen her nakedness. She herself groans and turns away. 9 Her uncleanness was in her skirts; she did not remember her future, she has descended beyond understanding, there is no comforter for her. See, O Yahweh, my persecution! My enemy has been made great! 10 The enemy has stretched out his hand over all her treasures; for she has seen the nations, they entered her sanctuary, those whom you commanded not to enter in your assembly. 11 All her people groan, they are searching for bread. They give their treasures for food, to bring back life. See, O Yahweh, and look, how I am despised. 12 Is it nothing to you, all who pass by? Look and see if there is sorrow like my sorrow, which was dealt to me, which Yahweh inflicted on the day of his wrath.

Lamentations,"12 Is it nothing to you, all who pass by? Look and see if there is sorrow like my sorrow, which was dealt to me, which Yahweh inflicted on the day of his wrath. 13 From heaven he sent fire, into my bones he let it descend. He spread out a net for my feet; he turned me back, he gave me devastation, fainting all day. 14 My rebellion was bound as a yoke, with his hand it was fastened together; it was put on my neck and caused my strength to fail. The Lord gave me into the hands of those whom I cannot withstand. 15 The Lord has rejected all my mighty ones in my midst. He called an assembly against me, to crush my young men; like in a wine press, the Lord has trodden on the virgin daughter of Judah. 16 For these things, I am weeping, my eyes flow with tears; because a comforter is far from me, one to restore my life. My sons are desolate because the enemy has prevailed. 17 Zion stretches out her hands; there is no one to comfort her. Yahweh has commanded against Jacob, that those surrounding him should be his enemies; Jerusalem has become a defilement among them. 18 Yahweh is righteous; I have rebelled against his word. Please hear, all the nations, And see my pain; My young women and young men went into captivity. 19 I have called to my lovers, they themselves deceived me; my priests and elders perished in the city when they sought food for themselves to revive their life. 20 See, O Yahweh, that I am in distress; my stomach is in torment, my heart has turned inside me because I have certainly rebelled. From outside a sword brings bereavement, inside the house it is like death. 21 They hear that I was groaning; there is no comforter for me. All my enemies have heard my misery, they are pleased that you have done it. Bring that day that you have proclaimed, And let them be like me. 22 Let all their evil come before you; and deal with them just as you have dealt with me because of all my crimes; for my groaning is much and my heart is faint. 1 How, in his anger, the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion in a cloud! He has thrown down from heavens to earth the splendor of Israel, and he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger. 2 The Lord has devoured; he has not shown mercy to all the dwellings of Jacob; he has broken down in his wrath the fortifications of the daughter of Judah; he has leveled to the ground, he has dishonored the kingdom and its commanders. 3 He has cut down in fierce anger all the might of Israel; he has withdrawn his right hand from the faces of the enemy, and he has burned in Jacob like a flaming fire, it has consumed all around. 4 He has bent his bow like an enemy; he has set his right hand like a foe, and he has slain all the treasures of the eye; in the tent of the daughter of Zion, he has poured out his anger like fire. 5 The Lord has become like an enemy; he has destroyed Israel; he has destroyed all its citadel fortresses; he has ruined all its fortifications and multiplied lamentation and mourning in the daughter of Judah. 6 He has broken down his dwelling place like the garden; he has ruined his appointed feasts; Yahweh has made them forget in Zion festival and Sabbath, and he has despised in his anger king and priest. 7 The Lord has rejected his altar; he has rejected his sanctuary; he has delivered into the hands of the enemy the walls of its citadel fortresses. They have cried out in the house of Yahweh like a day of an appointed feast. 8 Yahweh has planned to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. He measured with a line; he has not restrained his hand from destroying; he caused rampart and wall to mourn; together they have languished away. 9 Her gates have sunk into the earth; he has ruined and broken her bars, her kings and its princes are among the nations; there is no more law. Also, her prophets have not found a revelation from Yahweh. 10 They sit on the ground, the elders of the daughter of Zion are silent. They cast dust on their head, they have put on sackcloth; the young women of Jerusalem have bowed their head down to the ground. 11 My eyes have spent all their tears; my stomach is in torment, my heart is poured out on the earth because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, because child and babe faint in the public squares of a city. 12 To their mothers they say, “Where is the bread and wine?” as they faint like the wounded in the public squares of a city, as their life is being poured out onto the bosom of their mothers. 13 What can I say for you? What can I compare to you, O daughter of Jerusalem? To what can I liken you so that I can comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your destruction is as vast as the sea; who can heal you? 14 Your prophets had a vision for you, false and worthless; they have not exposed your sin, to restore your fortune; they have seen oracles for you, false and misleading. 15 They clap hands over you, all who pass along the way; they hiss and they shake their head, at the daughter of Jerusalem. Is this the city of which it is said, “A perfection of beauty, a joy for all the earth?” 16 They have opened their mouths against you, all your enemies. They hiss and gnash a tooth, and they say, “We have destroyed her! Surely this is the day we have hoped for; we have found it, we have seen it!” 17 Yahweh has done what he has planned; he has fulfilled his promise that he ordained from the days of old; he has demolished and not shown mercy; he has made an enemy rejoice over you, he has exalted the might of your foes. 18 Their heart cried to the Lord, “O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears stream down like a river; day and night, do not give yourself relief, do not give your eyes rest. 19 “Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the night watches; pour out your heart like water, before the face of the Lord. Lift to him your hands, for the life of your children, who faint in starvation, at the head of all streets.” 20 See, Yahweh, and take note! With whom have you dealt thus? Should women eat their young children of tender care? Should priest and prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord? 21 They lie in the soil of the streets, young and old; my young women and young men, they have fallen by the sword; you have slain on the day of your anger, you have slaughtered and not shown mercy. 22 You have summoned my horror from all around, as if for a feast day; no one on the day of Yahweh’s anger is a fugitive and a survivor; whoever I have cared for and reared, my enemy has destroyed. 1 I am a man who has seen misery, under the rod of his wrath. 2 He has driven me along, he brought darkness and not light. 3 Surely he has turned his hand against me, all day long. 4 He has worn out my flesh and skin, he has broken my bones.

Lamentations,"4 He has worn out my flesh and skin, he has broken my bones. 5 He has besieged and engulfed me with bitterness and hardship. 6 In darkness he has let me dwell like the dead of long ago. 7 He has built a wall around me, I cannot go out; he has made my bronze fetters heavy. 8 Though I cry out for help, he shuts out my prayers. 9 He has blocked my ways with dressed stones; he has made my paths crooked. 10 To me he is like a bear lying in wait, a lion in hiding. 11 He has forsaken my way and torn me to pieces; he has caused me desolation. 12 He has bent his bow and set me as the target for the arrow. 13 He shot the arrows of his quiver into my kidneys. 14 I have become a laughingstock for all the people, their mocking song all day long. 15 He has filled me with bitterness, he has drenched me with wormwood. 16 He has broken my teeth on grit, he has trampled me down in ash. 17 My life has been removed from peace, I have forgotten goodness. 18 And I have said, “My glory is ruined, my expectation from Yahweh.” 19 Remember my misery and bitterness, the wormwood and venom! 20 Surely my soul remembers and bows down within me. 21 This I have reminded myself, therefore I will hope. 22 The loyal love of Yahweh does not cease; his compassions do not come to an end. 23 They are new in the morning, great is your faithfulness. 24 “Yahweh is my portion,” says my soul, “Thus I will hope on him.” 25 Yahweh is good to those who wait on him, to the person that seeks him. 26 It is good to wait in silence for the salvation of Yahweh. 27 It is good for a man who carries the yoke of his childhood. 28 Let him sit alone and be silent when he has laid it on him. 29 Let him put his mouth in the dust; perhaps there is hope. 30 Let him give a cheek to his smiter, let him be filled with disgrace. 31 For the Lord will not reject forever. 32 For even though he causes grief he has compassion according to the greatness of his royal love. 33 He does not afflict willingly, or grieve anyone. 34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth; 35 to deprive one of justice before the face of the Most High; 36 to subvert a person in a legal dispute —the Lord has not found delight in these things. 37 Who can speak and it will happen if the Lord has not commanded it? 38 Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that disaster and good will come? 39 Why should any living person complain about his sin? 40 Let us test and examine our ways; let us return to Yahweh. 41 Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to God in the heavens. 42 We ourselves have transgressed and rebelled, you have not forgiven. 43 You have covered yourself in anger and pursued us, you have slain and not shown mercy. 44 You have covered yourself in a cloud so that prayer cannot pass through. 45 You have made us scum and refuse in the midst of the nations. 46 All our enemies have opened their mouth against us. 47 Fear and a pit have come upon us, desolation and destruction. 48 Channels of water run down my eyes because of the destruction of the daughter of my people. 49 My eyes have poured down unceasingly without respite, 50 until Yahweh looks down and sees from heaven. 51 My eyes inflict my soul because of all the daughters of my city. 52 My enemies hunt me without cause, like a bird. 53 They have silenced me in a pit, they have thrown a stone at me. 54 Water has flown over my head, I said, “I am cut off.” 55 I have called your name, O Yahweh, from the depths of the pit. 56 You have heard my cry, “Do not shut your ear to my cry for help, for my relief!” 57 You came near on a day when I called you, you said, “Do not fear!” 58 O Lord, you have pleaded for my cause, you have redeemed my life. 59 You have seen my injustice, O Yahweh; judge my case. 60 You have seen all their vengeance, all there plans against me. 61 You have heard their disgrace, O Yahweh, all their plans against me. 62 The lips and meditation of my assailants are against me all day long. 63 Look at their sitting and their standing, I am their mocking song. 64 Return to them what is deserved, O Yahweh, according to the work of their hands. 65 Give them a stubborn heart; curse them! 66 Pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh. 1 How the gold has grown dim, the pure gold has changed. The stones of holiness are scattered at the head of every street. 2 The precious sons of Zion weighed against fine gold, how they are thought of as earthen vessels of clay, the work of the potter’s hands. 3 Even the jackal bears the beast and nurses their cubs; but the daughter of my people has become ruthless, like ostriches in the wilderness. 4 The tongue of the nursling cleaves to its palate in thirst. Children beg for food, no one lays it out before them. 5 The ones who eat delicacies, they are ruined in the streets; the ones nurtured in purple lie on piles of trash. 6 The iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom; it was overthrown in a moment and no hands were laid on her. 7 Her princes were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than rubies, sapphire their appearance. 8 Now their appearance is blacker than soot, they are not recognized in the streets; their skin has shriveled on their bones, it has become dry like wood. 9 Happier were the victims of the sword than the victims of famine; they have pined away, very hungry for the crops of my field. 10 The hands of compassionate women, have cooked their children; they became as something to eat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 11 Yahweh has completed his anger, he has poured out his fierce anger; he has kindled a fire in Zion, it consumed her foundations. 12 The kings of the earth did not believe, and all the inhabitants of the world, that a foe and an enemy could enter into the gates of Jerusalem. 13 Because of the sins of her prophets, the guilt of her priests, who shed blood in her midst, of righteous people. 14 They wander blindly in the streets; they were defiled with the blood, their clothes could not be touched. 15 “Go away! Defiled!” they shout to them. “Go away! Go away! Do not touch!” so they left, they left; it was said among the nations, “They will no longer dwell with us.” 16 The presence of Yahweh has scattered them, he will no longer watch over them; they did not honor the priests, they did not show mercy to elders. 17 Still our eyes failed, looking for our help in vain; in our watchtower, we kept watch for a nation that could not save. 18 They hunted our steps, from walking in our streets; our end has come near, our days are finished, our end has come. 19 Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens; they chased us on the mountains, they have set an ambush for us in the desert. 20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed one of Yahweh, was captured in their pits; of whom we said, “In his shadow we will live among the nations.” 21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz; but to you also the cup will pass, you will become drunk and strip yourself bare. 22 The punishment of your iniquity is completed, O daughter of Zion, your exile will not continue; but he will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he will reveal your sins. 1 Remember, O Yahweh, what has become of us; take note, and see our disgrace! 2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses, to foreigners. 3 We have become orphans, fatherless, our mothers are like widows. 4 We pay for water with money, our wood comes to us at a price. 5 We are driven on our necks; we are weary, there is no rest for us. 6 We have made a deal with Egypt and Assyria to be satisfied with food. 7 Our fathers have sinned, they are no more; we bear their iniquity. 8 Slaves rule over us; there is no one to deliver us from their hand. 9 We risk our life for food because of the sword of the desert. 10 Our skin is hot like an oven because of the scorching famine. 11 They raped women in Zion, young women in the cities of Judah. 12 They hang princes by their hand; they do not show respect before elders. 13 Young men must carry a hand-mill and boys stumble under the wood. 14 Elders are no longer at the gate, young men no longer play stringed instruments. 15 The joy of our hearts has stopped; our circle-dancing has changed to a mourning ceremony. 16 The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned! 17 Because of this, our heart has become faint, because of these, our eyes have become dim. 18 Because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate, foxes tread on it. 19 You, O Yahweh, will sit forever on your throne for generation to generation. 20 Why have you forgotten us forever? Why have you forsaken us for so long? 21 Restore us to you, O Yahweh, that we will be restored; renew our days as of old. 22 Unless you have utterly rejected us, unless you are angry with us beyond measure.

Look, I do not know how to speak, for I am a youth.” 7 But Yahweh said to me, “You must not say, ‘I am a youth,’ for to whomever I send you, you will go, and whatever I command you, you will speak. 8 Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you,” declares Yahweh. 9 Then Yahweh stretched out his hand and he touched my mouth, and Yahweh said to me, “Look, I have put my words in your mouth. 10 See, I appoint you this day over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to pull down, and to destroy and to tear down, to build and to plant.” 11 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, “What are you seeing, Jeremiah?” And I said, “I am seeing a branch of an almond tree.” 12 Then Yahweh said to me, “You did well to see, for I am watching over my word to perform it.” 13 And the word of Yahweh came to me a second time, saying, “What are you seeing?” And I said, “I am seeing a boiling pot, and its face is from the face of the north.” 14 Then Yahweh said to me, “From the north disaster will be unleashed on all the inhabitants of the land. 15 For, look, I am calling to all the clans of the kingdoms of the north,” declares Yahweh, “and they will come and set each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its surrounding walls, and against all the cities of Judah. 16 And I will pass my judgments on them because of all their wickedness in that they have forsaken me, and they made sacrifices to other gods, and they bowed in worship to the works of their hands. 17 But you, you must gird your loins, and stand, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be afraid of them, or I will shatter you before them. 18 Now look, I have made you today as a fortified city and as an iron pillar and a bronze wall against all the land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land. 19 And they will fight against you but they will not prevail against you, for I am with you,” declares Yahweh, “to deliver you.” ",Jeremiah 1:4-19,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-14-19-55017/direct-download/tbd20090630.mp3
Jeremiah,"1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “I remember concerning you the loyal love of your childhood, the love of your betrothal-time, your going after me in the desert, in the land not sown. 3 Israel was holy to Yahweh, the first fruit of his produce. All those who ate it were held guilty; disaster came to them,” declares Yahweh.’ ” 4 Hear the word of Yahweh, O house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house of Israel. 5 Thus says Yahweh: “What injustice did your ancestors find in me that they were far from me, and they went after the vanity, and they became vain? 6 And they did not say, ‘Where is Yahweh, the one who brought us up from the land of Egypt, the one who led us in the desert, in a land of desert plains and gorges, in a land of dryness and deep darkness, in a land that no one passes through, and no human lives there?’ 7 And I brought you to the land of the orchard, to eat its fruit, and its good things. But you entered and defiled my land, and my inheritance you made a detestable thing. 8 The priests did not say, ‘Where is Yahweh?’ and those who handle the law did not know me, and the shepherds have rebelled against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and they went after things which do not profit. 9 Therefore I again bring a lawsuit against you,” declares Yahweh, “and with your children I bring a lawsuit. 10 For go over to the coasts of Cyprus and look, and send to Kedar and consider very closely, and see if there has been a thing like this: 11 Has a nation exchanged gods? And they are not gods! But my people have exchanged their glory for that which does not profit. 12 Be appalled, O heavens, at this, and shudder; be utterly desolate,” declares Yahweh. 13 “For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the source of living water, to hew out for themselves cisterns, cracked cisterns that can hold no water. 14 Is Israel a slave? Or a slave born in a house? Why has he become plunder? 15 The young lions have roared against him, they have raised their voices. And they have made his land as horror; his cities are destroyed, without an inhabitant. 16 Moreover, people of Memphis and Tahpanhes will shave your skull. 17 Did you not do this to yourself, by forsaking Yahweh, your God, at the time of your leading in the way? 18 And now why do you go the way of Egypt to drink the waters of the Shihor? And why do you go the way of Assyria to drink the waters of the Euphrates? 19 Your wickedness will chastise you, and your apostasies will reprove you. Therefore know and see that it is evil and bitter, your forsaking of Yahweh, your God, and fear of me is not in you,” declares the Lord, Yahweh of hosts. 20 “For from long ago you have broken your yoke, you tore to pieces your bonds. And you said, ‘I will not serve!’ But on every high hill and under every leafy tree you were lying down as a prostitute. 21 Yet I planted you as a choice vine, all of it a seed of trustworthiness. How then have you altered before me into something that is degenerate, the foreign vine? 22 For if you wash with natron, and you use much soap, your guilt is sticking as a stain before me,” declares the Lord Yahweh. 23 “How can you say, ‘I have not defiled myself, I have not gone after the Baals?’ Look at your way in the valley, know what you have done. You are a young she-camel, interweaving her ways. 24 A wild ass accustomed to the desert, in the desire of her soul. She gasps for wind in her rutting time. Who can quell her lust? All those who seek her will not grow weary, in her month they will find her. 25 Restrain your foot from being barefoot, and your throat from thirst. But you said, ‘It is hopeless. No! For I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.’ 26 As the shame of a thief when he is caught in the act, so the house of Israel will be ashamed. They, their kings, their officials, and their priests, and their prophets. 27 Those who say to the tree, ‘You are my father,’ and to the stone, ‘You gave birth to me.’ For they have turned their backs to me, and not their faces. But in the time of their trouble they say, ‘Arise and save us.’ 28 But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them arise if they can save you in the time of your trouble. For according to the number of your towns are your gods, O Judah. 29 Why do you complain to me? All of you have rebelled against me,” declares Yahweh. 30 “For in vain I have struck your children. They accepted no discipline. Your sword devoured your prophets, like a ravening lion. 31 O generation, you see the word of Yahweh. Have I been a desert to Israel? Or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say, ‘We roam about freely, we will not come again to you’? 32 Can a young woman forget her ornaments? Or a bride her sashes? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number. 33 How well you do on your way to seek love! Therefore even to the wicked woman you can teach your ways. 34 Also on your skirts is found the blood of the life of the innocent, the poor. You did not find them in the act of breaking into a house. But in spite of all these things, 35 yet you say, ‘But I am innocent, surely his anger has turned away from me.’ Look, I am entering into judgment with you because of your saying, ‘I have not sinned.’ 36 How you go about so much changing your way! Also by Egypt you will be put to shame, just as you were put to shame by Assyria. 37 Also from there you will come out with your hands on your head, for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper through them.

Jeremiah,"1 A saying: ‘Look, if a man divorces his wife, and she goes from him and she becomes another man’s wife, will he return to her again?’ Will not that land be greatly defiled? And you have prostituted yourself with many lovers, would you now return to me?” declares Yahweh. 2 “Lift up your eyes at the barren heights, and see where you have not been ravished. Beside the roads you sat for them like an Arab in the desert, and you have defiled the land with your fornication and with your wickedness. 3 Therefore rain showers have been withheld, and the spring rain has not come. Yet you have the forehead of a woman prostitute, you refuse to be ashamed. 4 Have you not just now called to me, ‘My father, you are the close friend of my youth? 5 Will he be angry forever? Will he maintain it always’? Look, you have spoken, but you have done all the evil that you could.” 6 Then Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah, the king, “Have you seen what apostate Israel has done? She has gone on every high hill and under every leafy tree and she has prostituted herself there. 7 And I thought, ‘After her doing all these things to me she will return,’ but she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. 8 And I saw that for this very reason, that on account of apostate Israel committing adultery I divorced her and gave the letter of divorce to her. Yet her treacherous sister Judah was not afraid and she went and prostituted herself also. 9 And it was because of the frivolity of her fornication that she defiled the land and committed adultery with the stone and with the tree. 10 Yet even in all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only in pretense,” declares Yahweh. 11 Then Yahweh said to me, “Apostate Israel has proved herself more upright than treacherous Judah. 12 Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, ‘Return, apostate Israel,’ declares Yahweh. ‘I will not cause my anger to fall on you. For I am loyal,’ declares Yahweh. ‘I will not be angry forever. 13 Only acknowledge your guilt, that against Yahweh your God you have rebelled, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every leafy tree, and you have not obeyed my voice,’ declares Yahweh.” 14 “Return, apostate children,” declares Yahweh. “For I am your master, and I will take you one from a city and two from a clan, and I will bring you to Zion. 15 Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart and they will feed you knowledge and insight. 16 And it will be when you have multiplied and become fruitful in the land in those days,” declares Yahweh, “they will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of Yahweh.’ And it will not come to mind, nor will they remember it, nor will they miss it, nor will it be made again. 17 At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘The Throne of Yahweh,’ and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem, and they will no longer go after the stubbornness of their evil heart. 18 In those days the house of Judah will walk along with the house of Israel and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave as an inheritance to your ancestors. 19 Then I thought, ‘How I would set you among the children, and I would give you a land of desire, an inheritance of the glory of the hosts of nations.’ And I thought, ‘You would call me, “My father,” and you would not turn back from behind me.’ 20 However, as a wife departs treacherously from her lover, so you have dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel,” declares Yahweh. 21 “A voice is heard on the barren heights, the weeping of the pleas for mercy of the children of Israel, because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God. 22 Return, O apostate children, I will heal your backsliding. ‘Look, we come to you, for you are Yahweh our God. 23 Surely, an illusion comes from the hills, the turmoil on the mountains. Surely, in Yahweh our God is the salvation of Israel. 24 But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our ancestors from our youth, their flocks, and their cattle, their sons and their daughters. 25 Let us lie down in our shame, and let our disgrace cover us. For against Yahweh our God we have sinned, we and our ancestors, from our youth and until this day. and we have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God.’ ",Jeremiah 3:1-25,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-31-25-62553/direct-download/tbd20090702.mp3
Jeremiah,"10 Yet even in all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only in pretense,” declares Yahweh. 11 Then Yahweh said to me, “Apostate Israel has proved herself more upright than treacherous Judah. 12 Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, ‘Return, apostate Israel,’ declares Yahweh. ‘I will not cause my anger to fall on you. For I am loyal,’ declares Yahweh. ‘I will not be angry forever. 13 Only acknowledge your guilt, that against Yahweh your God you have rebelled, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every leafy tree, and you have not obeyed my voice,’ declares Yahweh.” 14 “Return, apostate children,” declares Yahweh. “For I am your master, and I will take you one from a city and two from a clan, and I will bring you to Zion. 15 Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart and they will feed you knowledge and insight. 16 And it will be when you have multiplied and become fruitful in the land in those days,” declares Yahweh, “they will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of Yahweh.’ And it will not come to mind, nor will they remember it, nor will they miss it, nor will it be made again. 17 At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘The Throne of Yahweh,’ and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem, and they will no longer go after the stubbornness of their evil heart. 18 In those days the house of Judah will walk along with the house of Israel and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave as an inheritance to your ancestors. 19 Then I thought, ‘How I would set you among the children, and I would give you a land of desire, an inheritance of the glory of the hosts of nations.’ And I thought, ‘You would call me, “My father,” and you would not turn back from behind me.’ 20 However, as a wife departs treacherously from her lover, so you have dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel,” declares Yahweh. 21 “A voice is heard on the barren heights, the weeping of the pleas for mercy of the children of Israel, because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God. 22 Return, O apostate children, I will heal your backsliding. ‘Look, we come to you, for you are Yahweh our God. 23 Surely, an illusion comes from the hills, the turmoil on the mountains.

For against Yahweh our God we have sinned, we and our ancestors, from our youth and until this day. and we have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God.’ 1 If you return, O Israel,” declares Yahweh, “you return to me. And if you remove your abominations from my presence, and you do not wander, 2 and you swear, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then nations will be blessed by him, and in him they will boast.” 3 For thus says Yahweh to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, “Break up for yourselves prepared virgin soil, and you must not sow among thornbushes. 4 Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and remove the foreskins of your hearts, men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, lest my wrath goes forth like the fire and burns, and there is no one who extinguishes it, because of the evil of your deeds.” 5 Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say, “Blow a horn through the land, call with a loud voice and say, ‘Be gathered and let us go into the fortified cities.’ 6 Lift up a signal toward Zion, bring yourselves to safety; you must not remain standing, for I am bringing evil from the north, and a great destruction. 7 A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations has set out. He has gone out from his place to make your land as a horror, your cities will go to ruin without inhabitant. 8 Because of this gird yourselves with sackcloth, lament and wail, for the burning anger of Yahweh has not turned back from us. 9 And then on that day,” declares Yahweh, “the heart of the king and the heart of the officials will be destroyed, and the priests will be appalled, and the prophets will be astonished.” 10 Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh, surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘It will be peace for you,’ while the sword reaches up to the throat.” 11 At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind from the barren heights in the desert, in the direction of the daughter of my people, not to winnow and not to cleanse, 12 a wind too strong for these will come for me, now also I speak judgments against them.” 13 Look, he comes up like the clouds, and his chariots are like the whirlwind, his horses are swifter than eagles, woe to us, for we are devastated. 14 Cleanse your heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, so that you may be saved. How long will your thoughts of mischief dwell in your inner part? 15 For a voice is declaring from Dan, and is proclaiming disaster from the mountain of Ephraim. 16 “Report to the nations, ‘Here they are!’ Proclaim against Jerusalem, ‘Besiegers are coming from a distant land, and they raise their voice against the cities of Judah.’ 17 Like watchers of a field they were against her from all around, because she has rebelled against me,” declares Yahweh. 18 “You obtained this for yourself because of your way and your deeds. This is your doom, for it is bitter, yes, it has reached up to your heart.” 19 My bowels, my bowels! I writhe! The walls of my heart! My heart is restless within me, I cannot keep silent, for I hear in my inner self the sound of a horn, the alarm of war. 20 Destruction on destruction is proclaimed, for all of the land is devastated. Suddenly my tents are devastated, my tent curtains in a moment. 21 How long must I see the banner, and hear the sound of a horn? 22 “For my people are foolish, they have not known me. They are foolish children, and they do not have insight. They are skillful at doing evil, and they do not know how to do good.” 23 I looked at the earth, and behold, it was wasteland and emptiness, and to the heavens, and they were without their light. 24 I looked at the mountains, and behold, they were quaking, and all of the hills were jolted to and fro. 25 I looked and behold, there was no person, and all of the birds of the sky had fled. 26 I looked and behold, the fruitful land was a desert, and all of its cities were ruined before Yahweh, before the face of his burning anger. 27 For thus says Yahweh, “All of the land will be a desolation, yet I will not make a complete desolation. 28 Because of this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above will become dark. Because I have spoken, I have planned, and I have not relented, and I will not turn back from it.” 29 From the sound of a horseman and an archer every town flees, they enter in the thickets and among the rocks they climb. Every town is forsaken, and there is no person who lives in them. 30 And you, O devastated one, what do you do, that you put on crimson, that you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold, that you make your eyes look bigger with the eye make-up? In vain you beautify yourself. Your lovers reject you; they seek your life. 31 For I heard a voice like an ill woman, anxiety like a woman who bears her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion. She is gasping for breath, she is spreading out her hands: “Woe is me, for I am becoming tired before killers.” 1 “Roam about through the streets of Jerusalem, and look please, and take note, and search at its public squares, if you can find a person who does justice, who seeks honesty, so that I may forgive it. 2 And though they say, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ therefore they swear falsely.” 3 O Yahweh, do not your eyes look for honesty? You have struck them, but they felt no pain, you have destroyed them, they refused to take discipline. They have hardened their faces more than rock, they have refused to turn back. 4 Then I said, “They are just simple people, they are foolish, for they know not the way of Yahweh, the law of their God. 5 Let me go to the great, and let me speak with them, for they know the way of Yahweh, the law of their God.” However, they together have broken the yoke, they have torn to pieces the bonds. 6 Therefore a lion from the forest will kill them, A wolf from the desert plains will devastate them. A leopard is watching their cities, everyone who goes out from there will be torn, because their transgressions are many, their apostasies are numerous. 7 “How can I forgive you? Your children have forsaken me, and they have sworn by those who are not gods. But I fed them to the full, and they committed adultery, and flocked to the house of a prostitute. 8 They were well-fed lusty horses, they neighed each to the wife of his neighbor. 9 Because of these things shall I not punish?” declares Yahweh, “and on a nation who is like this, shall I not take revenge? 10 Go up through her vineyards and destroy, but you must not make complete destruction. Remove her branches, for they are not to Yahweh. 11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt utterly treacherously with me,” declares Yahweh. 12 “They have denied Yahweh, and have said, ‘Not he, for evil will not come on us, we will see neither sword nor famine. 13 And the prophets are like wind, and the word is not in them.’ Thus it will be done to them.” 14 Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, “Because you have spoken this word, look, I am making my words in your mouth like a fire, and this people wood, and it will devour them. 15 Look, I am about to bring on you a nation from afar, O house of Israel,” declares Yahweh. “It is an enduring nation, it is an ancient nation. A nation whose language you do not know, and you cannot understand what they speak. 16 Their quiver is like an open tomb, all of them are warriors. 17 And they will eat your harvest and your food, they will eat your sons and your daughters, they will eat your flock and your herd, they will eat your vine and your fig tree, they will smash with the sword your fortified cities, in which you trust. 18 “But even in those days,” declares Yahweh, “I will not make you a complete destruction. 19 And then, when you people say, ‘Why has Yahweh our God done all of these things to us?’ Then you will say to them, ‘As you have forsaken me and have served gods of a foreign land in your land, so will you serve strangers in a land that does not belong to you.’ 20 “Declare this in the house of Jacob, and proclaim it in Judah, saying, 21 ‘Hear this please, O foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear.’ 22 Do you not revere me?” declares Yahweh, “Do you not tremble before me? For I have placed the sand as a boundary for the sea, as an everlasting limit, and it cannot pass over it, and they rise and fall loudly, but they cannot prevail, and its waves roar, but they cannot pass over it. 23 But for this people is a stubborn and rebellious heart, they have turned aside and have gone away. 24 And they do not say in their hearts, ‘Let us fear please Yahweh our God, the one who gives the autumn rain and the spring rain in its season, the set times of the harvest he keeps for us.’ 25 Your iniquities have disturbed these, and your sins have kept away the good from you. 26 For wicked people are found among my people, they lie in wait like the hiding of fowlers, they set up a trap, they catch humans. 27 Like a cage full of birds, so their houses are full of fraud. Therefore they have become great, and they have become rich. 28 They have grown fat, they have grown sleek, also, their evil deeds have no limit. They do not judge with justice, the legal cause of the orphan, or allow it to succeed, and the legal case of the poor, they do not defend. 29 Because of these things shall I not punish?” declares Yahweh, “and on a nation who is like this, shall I not take revenge? 30 A horrific event and something horrible has happened in the land. 31 The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own authority, and my people love it so much. But what will you do when the end comes? 1 Flee for safety, O children of Benjamin, from the midst of Jerusalem. And in Tekoa blow a horn, and on Beth-haccherem lift up a signal, for evil looks down from the north, and a great destruction. 2 The lovely and the delicate, the daughter of Jerusalem, I will destroy. 3 Shepherds and their flocks will come against her, they will pitch their tents against her all around, they will pasture, each his portion. 4 Sanctify war against her. Arise, and let us attack at noon. Woe to us, for the day turns, for the shadows of evening are lengthened. 5 Arise, and let us attack by night, and let us destroy her citadel fortresses.” 6 For thus says Yahweh of hosts, “Cut down trees and heap up a siege ramp against Jerusalem. This is the city that must be punished, its oppression is in its midst. 7 As a water well keeps its water cool, so she keeps cool her wickedness. Violence and destruction are heard within her, sickness and wounds are continually before me. 8 Be warned, O Jerusalem, lest I turn away from you in disgust, lest I make you a desolation, a land that is not inhabited.” 9 Thus says Yahweh of hosts: “They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine, turn back your hand over the branches like a grape-gatherer. 10 To whom shall I speak and admonish, that they may hear? Look, their ears are closed, and they are not able to listen attentively. Look, the word of Yahweh is to them an object of scorn, they do not delight in it. 11 But I am full with the wrath of Yahweh, I struggle to hold it in. Pour it out on the children in the street, and on the assemblies of young men at the same time. For even husband with wife will get trapped, the old with him who is full of days. 12 And their houses will be turned over to others, their fields and their wives together. For I will stretch out my hand against the inhabitants of the land,” declares Yahweh. 13 “For from the smallest of them to the greatest of them, everyone makes profit for unlawful gain. And from the prophet to the priest, everyone practices deceit. 14 And they have treated the wound of my people lightly, saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ but there is no peace. 15 Have they acted ashamed, for they have committed a detestable thing? Not at all, nor were they ashamed; they did not know to feel humiliated. Therefore they will fall among those who fall at the time I punish them, they will stumble,” says Yahweh. 16 Thus says Yahweh: “Stand at the roads and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the way of the good is, and walk in it, and find rest for your inner selves. But they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’ 17 And I raised up watchmen over you: ‘Listen attentively to the sound of a horn.’ But they said, ‘We will not listen attentively.’ 18 Therefore hear, O nations, and know, O community, what will happen to them. 19 Hear, O earth, look, I am about to bring disaster to this people, the fruit of their plans, because they have not listened attentively to my words, and my teaching, they have rejected it also. 20 What is this to me? Frankincense comes from Sheba, and the precious spice reed from a distant land. Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, your sacrifices are not pleasing to me.” 21 Therefore thus says Yahweh: “Look, I am about to put before this people stumbling blocks, and they will stumble against them, fathers and children together, neighbor and his friend will perish.” 22 Thus says Yahweh: “Look, a people is coming from the land of the north, a great nation is woken up from the farthest part of the earth. 23 The bow and the short sword they grasp are cruel, and they show no mercy. Their sound roars like the sea, and on horses they ride, drawn up like a man for battle against you, O daughter of Zion.” 24 We have heard news of it, our hands grow slack, anxiety has grasped us, pain as a woman who gives birth. 25 You must not go out into the field, and you must not walk on the road, for the enemy has a sword, terror is all around. 26 O daughter of my people, gird yourself with sackcloth, and roll about in the ashes in mourning, a mourning ceremony as for an only child. Make for yourself wailing of bitterness, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us. 27 “I have made you an assayer among my people, a fortification, so that you may know and put to the test their ways. 28 All of them are stubborn rebels, going about talking slander. They are bronze and iron, they are all behaving corruptly. 29 The bellows are burned up, lead is consumed by fire. In vain he keeps on refining, but the wicked are not torn apart. 30 They are called rejected silver, For Yahweh has rejected them.” ",Jeremiah 3:10-6:30,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-310-630-62554/direct-download/tbd20090703.mp3
Jeremiah,"1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, 2 “Stand in the gate of the house of Yahweh and proclaim there this word, and say, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, all of Judah, those who enter through these gates to bow in worship to Yahweh. 3 Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Make your ways and your deeds good and let me dwell with you in this place. 4 Do not trust in the deceitful words, saying, ‘The temple of Yahweh, the temple of Yahweh, they are the temple of Yahweh.’ 5 For if you truly make your ways and your deeds good, if you truly do justice between a man and his neighbor, 6 you do not oppress the alien, the orphan, and the widow, you do not shed innocent blood in this place, and you do not go after other gods to your harm, 7 then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your ancestors forever and ever. 8 Look, you are relying for yourselves on deceitful words without benefiting. 9 Will you steal? Will you murder? And will you commit adultery? And will you swear falsely? And will you make a smoke offering to the Baal? And will you go after other gods whom you have not known? 10 And then you come and you stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and you say, ‘we are safe to go on doing all of these detestable things.’ 11 Has this house, which is called by my name, become a cave of robbers in your eyes? Look, I, even I, have seen it,” declares Yahweh. 12 “For go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell in the beginning, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel. 13 And now, because of your doing all these things,” declares Yahweh, “and I have spoken to you over and over again, and you have not listened, and I called you, and you have not answered, 14 therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, in which you are trusting, and to the place that I gave to you and to your ancestors what I did to Shiloh. 15 And I will cast you out of my sight just as I cast out all of your blood relatives, all of the offspring of Ephraim.” ’ 16 “And you, you must not pray for this people, and you must not lift up for them a cry of entreaty or a prayer, and you must not plead with me, for I will not hear you. 17 Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 18 The children are gathering wood, and the fathers are kindling the fire, and the women are kneading dough to make sacrificial cakes for the queen of heaven, and they pour out libations to other gods for the sake of provoking me to anger. 19 Are they provoking me to anger? ” declares Yahweh, “Is it not themselves they hurt, for the sake of the shame of their faces?” 20 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, “Look, my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, on the humankind, and on the animal, and on the tree of the field, and on the fruit of the ground, and it will burn and not be extinguished.” 21 Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh. 22 For I did not speak with your ancestors, nor did I command them in the day of bringing them out from the land of Egypt, concerning the matter of burnt offering and sacrifice. 23 But I only commanded them this word, saying, ‘Obey my voice, and I will be to you God, and you will be to me people, and you must walk in all of the way that I command you, so that it goes well with you.’ 24 Yet they did not obey, and they did not incline their ear, but they walked in their own plans, in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and they became worse instead of better. 25 From the day that your ancestors came out from the land of Egypt until this day I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, day after day, sending again and again. 26 Yet they have not listened to me and they have not inclined their ear, but they have hardened their neck, they did more evil than their ancestors. 27 So you shall speak to them all these words, but they will not listen to you, and you shall call to them, but they will not answer you. 28 “And you shall say to them, ‘This is the nation that has not obeyed the voice of Yahweh their God, and they have not accepted discipline. The truth has perished, and it is cut off from their mouths. 29 Shear your hair and throw it away, and lift up a lament on the barren heights, for Yahweh has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.’ 30 For the people of Judah have done evil in my eyes,” declares Yahweh, “They have set their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it. 31 And they built the high place of Topheth, which is in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I have not commanded, and it did not come into my mind. 32 Therefore look, days are about to come,” declares Yahweh, “and it will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of the Slaughter, and they will bury in Topheth until there is no more place. 33 And the dead bodies of this people will be as food for the birds of the heavens, and for the animals of the earth, without anyone to scare them away. 34 And I will cause to disappear from the towns of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the sound of jubilation, and the sound of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, for the land will become a site of ruins. 1 “At that time,” declares Yahweh, “they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of its officials, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Judah from their graves. 2 And they shall spread them out before the sun, and before the moon, and before all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and which they have gone after, and which they have inquired about, and to which they have bowed in worship. They shall not be gathered, and they shall not be buried; they will be like dung on the surface of the ground. 3 And death will be preferred to life by all the remaining of this evil clan in all the remaining places where I have driven them away,” declares Yahweh of hosts. 4 “And you shall say to them, ‘Thus asks Yahweh: “Do men fall and not stand up? If one turns away does he not return? 5 Why has this people, Jerusalem, turned away in enduring apostasy? They have kept hold of deceit, they have refused to return. 6 I have listened attentively, and I have listened. They do not speak honestly, there is no man who regrets his wickedness, saying, ‘What have I done?’ All of them are turning to their ways of running, like a horse plunging into battle. 7 Even the stork in heaven knows its appointed time, and the turtledove, and the swallow, and the song bird, they observe the time of their coming. But my people do not know the ordinance of Yahweh. 8 How can you say, ‘We are wise and the law of Yahweh is with us’? Look, surely the lying stylus of the scribes has made it a lie. 9 The wise will be put to shame, they will be dismayed, and they will get taken. Look, they have rejected the word of Yahweh, and what is wisdom to them? 10 Therefore I will give their wives to others, their fields to conquerors, because from the smallest to the greatest, all of them make profit for unlawful gain, from prophet to priest, all of them practice deceit. 11 And they have treated the wound of the daughter of my people lightly, saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ but there is no peace. 12 Were they ashamed, for they had committed a detestable thing? What’s worse, they were not ashamed at all, and they did not know to feel humiliated. Therefore they will fall among those who fall; at the time of their punishment they will stumble,” says Yahweh. 13 “I will take away their harvest,” declares Yahweh. “There are no grapes on the vine, and there are no figs on the fig tree, and the leaves wither, and what I gave to them passed over them.” ’ ” 14 Why are we sitting? Gather, and let us go into the fortified cities, and let us perish there, for Yahweh our God has caused us to perish, and has provided drink for us, water of poison, because we have sinned against Yahweh. 15 We hope for peace, but there is no good, for a time of healing, but there is terror. 16 “From Dan is heard the snorting of their horses, from the sound of the neighing of their stallions all the land quakes, for they come and devour the land, and that which fills the city, and those who live in it. 17 For look, I am letting loose among you snakes, adders for which there is no incantation, and they will bite you,” declares Yahweh. 18 “My comfort is gone from me, sorrow is on me, my heart is sick. 19 Look, the sound of the cry for help of the daughter of my people from a distant land, ‘Is Yahweh not in Zion? Is her king not in her?’ Why have they provoked me to anger with their images, with idols of a foreign land?” 20 The harvest has passed, the summer has come to an end, and we have not received help. 21 “Because of the wound of the daughter of my people I am broken down, I mourn, horror has seized me. 22 Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no healer there? Why, then, has the healing of the daughter of my people not been restored? 1 Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, so that I might weep day and night, for the slain of the daughter of my people. 2 Oh that I had in the desert a place of overnight lodging for travelers, that I may leave my people and go from them, for all of them are adulterers, a band of traitors. 3 And they bend their tongue like their bow, for falsehood and not truth is superior in the land, for they go forth from evil to evil, and they do not know me,” declares Yahweh. 4 “Let everyone be on your guard against his neighbor, and you must not trust in any brother, for everyone surely betrays, and every neighbor goes about with slander. 5 And everyone deceives his neighbor, and they do not speak the truth, they have taught their tongues to speak lies, they are tired from going astray. 6 Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit, upon deceit they refuse to know me,” declares Yahweh. 7 Therefore, thus says Yahweh of hosts: “Look, I am about to refine them, and I will test them, for what else can I do, because of the presence of the daughter of my people? 8 Their tongue is a murderous arrow, it speaks deceit. With his mouth he speaks peace with his neighbor, but in his inner parts he sets up his ambush. 9 Because of these things shall I not punish them?” declares Yahweh, “On a nation that is like this shall I not take revenge? 10 For the mountains I lift up weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the desert a lament, because they are laid waste so that no man passes through. And the sounds of cattle are not heard, from the birds of heaven to the animals they have fled, they are gone. 11 And I will make Jerusalem as heaps of ruins, a lair of jackals, and the towns of Judah I will make a desolation, without inhabitants. 12 Who is the wise man that can understand this? And to whom has the mouth of Yahweh spoken, so that he may declare it? Why is the land destroyed? It is laid waste like the desert so that no one passes through.” 13 And Yahweh said, “Because of their forsaking my law that I set before them, and they have not obeyed my voice, and have not walked in it, 14 but they went after the stubbornness of their heart, and after the Baals, which their ancestors taught them.” 15 Therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Look, I am feeding this people wormwood, and providing drink for them, water of poison, 16 and I will scatter them among the nations that they have not known, they and their ancestors, and I will send the sword after them until I bring them to an end.” 17 Thus says Yahweh of hosts: “Consider closely, and call for the wailing women, so that they come, and send for the skillful women, so that they come. 18 And let them hasten, and let them lift up wailing over us, so that our eyes may melt with tears, and our eyelids may flow with water. 19 For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion, ‘How we are devastated! We are very ashamed because we have left the land, because they have overthrown our dwelling places.’ 20 For hear, O women, the word of Yahweh, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters a lamentation, and each woman her neighbor a lament. 21 For death has come into our windows, it has entered into our fortresses, to cut off the children from the streets, the young men from the public squares. 22 Speak, ‘thus declares Yahweh: “The dead body of the human will fall like dung upon the surface of the field, and like cut grain behind the reaper, and there is no one who gathers.” ’ ” 23 Thus says Yahweh, “The wise man must not boast in his wisdom, and the warrior must not boast in his might, the wealthy man must not boast in his wealth. 24 But only in this must the one who boasts boast, that he has insight, and that he knows me, that I am Yahweh, showing loyal love, justice, and righteousness on the earth, for in these things I delight,” declares Yahweh.

Jeremiah,"1 Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, so that I might weep day and night, for the slain of the daughter of my people. 2 Oh that I had in the desert a place of overnight lodging for travelers, that I may leave my people and go from them, for all of them are adulterers, a band of traitors. 3 And they bend their tongue like their bow, for falsehood and not truth is superior in the land, for they go forth from evil to evil, and they do not know me,” declares Yahweh. 4 “Let everyone be on your guard against his neighbor, and you must not trust in any brother, for everyone surely betrays, and every neighbor goes about with slander. 5 And everyone deceives his neighbor, and they do not speak the truth, they have taught their tongues to speak lies, they are tired from going astray. 6 Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit, upon deceit they refuse to know me,” declares Yahweh. 7 Therefore, thus says Yahweh of hosts: “Look, I am about to refine them, and I will test them, for what else can I do, because of the presence of the daughter of my people? 8 Their tongue is a murderous arrow, it speaks deceit.

We are very ashamed because we have left the land, because they have overthrown our dwelling places.’ 20 For hear, O women, the word of Yahweh, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters a lamentation, and each woman her neighbor a lament. 21 For death has come into our windows, it has entered into our fortresses, to cut off the children from the streets, the young men from the public squares. 22 Speak, ‘thus declares Yahweh: “The dead body of the human will fall like dung upon the surface of the field, and like cut grain behind the reaper, and there is no one who gathers.” ’ ” 23 Thus says Yahweh, “The wise man must not boast in his wisdom, and the warrior must not boast in his might, the wealthy man must not boast in his wealth. 24 But only in this must the one who boasts boast, that he has insight, and that he knows me, that I am Yahweh, showing loyal love, justice, and righteousness on the earth, for in these things I delight,” declares Yahweh. 25 “Look, days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “and I will call into account all those who are circumcised in the foreskin: 26 Egypt, Judah, and Edom, and the Ammonites, and Moab, and all those who are trimmed to the side, those who live in the desert, for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of heart.” 1 Hear the word that Yahweh speaks to you, O house of Israel. 2 Thus says Yahweh: “You must not learn the way of the nations, and you must not be dismayed by the signs of the heavens, for the nations are dismayed by them. 3 For the statutes of the peoples are vanity, for it is a tree cut down from the forest, the work of the hands of a craftsman with the tool. 4 He decorates it with silver and gold, they strengthen it with nails and hammers, so that it does not stagger. 5 They are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, they cannot speak. Indeed, they must be carried, for they cannot march. You must not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil; furthermore, to do good is not in them.” 6 There is none like you, O Yahweh, you are great and your name is great in might. 7 Who would not revere you, O king of the nations? For you it is fitting. For among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like you. 8 At the same time they are stupid and foolish, in the instruction of idols, it is wood. 9 Silver beaten from Tarshish is brought, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the craftsman and the hands of the goldsmith. Blue and purple are their clothing, all of them are the work of skillful people. 10 But Yahweh is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king. Because of his wrath the earth quakes, and the nations cannot endure his anger. 11 “Thus you shall say to them, ‘Gods who did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under these heavens. 12 He is the maker of the earth by his power, who created the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretched out heaven. 13 When he utters his voice there is a noise of water in the heavens, and he causes the mist to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain, and he causes the wind to go out from his storehouses. 14 Everyone is stupid, without knowledge, every goldsmith is ashamed by his divine image, for his cast image is an illusion, and there is no breath in them. 15 They are vanity, a work of mockery, at the time of their punishment, they will perish. 16 The portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the creator of everything, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance, Yahweh of hosts is his name. 17 Gather your bundle from the ground, you who live under the siege.’ ” 18 For thus says Yahweh, “Look, I am about to sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and I will bring distress to them, so that they may feel it.” 19 Woe to me, because of my wound. My wound is incurable. But I said, “Surely this is my sickness, and I must bear it.” 20 My tent is devastated, and all my tent cords are torn. My children have gone out from me, and they are not. There is no one who pitches my tent again, or one who puts up my tent curtains. 21 For the shepherds have become stupid, they do not seek Yahweh. Therefore they do not have insight, and all of their flock are scattered. 22 Listen, news: Look, it is coming, a great roar from the land of the north, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a lair of jackals. 23 I know, O Yahweh, that to the human is not his own way, nor to a person is the walking and the directing of his own step. 24 Chastise me, O Yahweh, but in moderation, not in your anger, lest you eradicate me. 25 Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you, and on the peoples that do not call on your name, for they have devoured Jacob, they have devoured and consumed him, and they have caused his settlement to be desolate. 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, 2 “Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 3 and say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: “The man is cursed who does not obey the words of this covenant, 4 which I commanded your ancestors in the day of my bringing them from the land of Egypt, from the furnace of iron, saying, ‘Listen to my voice and do according to all that I command you, so will you be my people, and I will be your God.’ 5 in order to keep the oath that I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day.” ’ ” Then I answered and said, “Let it be so, O Yahweh.” 6 And Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant and do them, 7 for I solemnly admonished your ancestors in the day of my leading them out from the land of Egypt and up to this day, admonishing persistently, saying, “Obey my voice.” 8 But they did not obey and they did not incline their ear. Instead each one walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore, I brought on them all the words of this covenant which I commanded them to do, and they did not do it.’ ” 9 And Yahweh said to me, “A conspiracy is found among the people of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 10 They have turned back to the iniquities of their former ancestors, who refused to obey my words, and they have gone after other gods, to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their ancestors.” 11 Therefore thus says Yahweh, “I am about to bring on them disaster from which they will not be able to escape. Though they cry out to me, yet I will not listen to them. 12 Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they are making smoke offerings, but they will certainly not save them in the time of their trouble. 13 For the number of your towns are your gods, O Judah, and the number of the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful things, to make smoke offerings to Baal. 14 Therefore you must not pray for this people, and you must not lift up for them a cry of entreaty, or a prayer, for I will not listen in the time of their calling to me, in the time of their trouble. 15 What rights has my beloved in my house when she has done many wicked things? Can the flesh of holiness pass over you? For you engage in your wickedness, then you exult. 16 Yahweh called your name, ‘A leafy olive tree, beautiful with fine fruit.’ With the sound of a great storm he will set fire to it, and its branches will be good for nothing. 17 And Yahweh of hosts, the one who planted you, has spoken evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and the house of Judah, that they have done to themselves, to provoke me to anger by making smoke offerings to Baal.” 18 Moreover, Yahweh let it be made known to me, and I knew. Then you showed me their deeds. 19 And I was like a gentle ram-lamb that is brought to slaughter, and I did not know that they planned plans against me, saying, “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name will no longer be remembered.” 20 But O Yahweh of hosts, who judges in righteousness, who tests the inmost being, and the mind, let me see your retribution upon them, for to you I have revealed my legal case. 21 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the people of Anathoth who seek your life, saying, “You shall not prophesy in the name of Yahweh or you will die by our hand.” 22 Therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts: “Look, I am about to punish them. The young men will die by the sword. Their sons and their daughters will die by the famine. 23 And a remnant will not be left for them, for I will bring disaster to the people of Anathoth, the year of their punishment.” ",Jeremiah 9-11,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-9-11-62556/direct-download/tbd20090707.mp3
Jeremiah,"6 And Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant and do them, 7 for I solemnly admonished your ancestors in the day of my leading them out from the land of Egypt and up to this day, admonishing persistently, saying, “Obey my voice.” 8 But they did not obey and they did not incline their ear.

The young men will die by the sword. Their sons and their daughters will die by the famine. 23 And a remnant will not be left for them, for I will bring disaster to the people of Anathoth, the year of their punishment.” 1 You will be in the right, O Yahweh, when I complain to you. Even so, let me speak my claims with you. Why does the way of the wicked succeed? All those who deal treacherously with treachery are at ease. 2 Not only do you plant them, they take root. They grow, but also they produce fruit. You are near in their mouths, but far from their inmost beings. 3 But you, O Yahweh, you know me, you see me, and you test that my heart is with you. Tear them apart like sheep for the slaughtering, and set them apart for the day of slaughter. 4 How long will the land mourn, and the vegetation of every field dry up, because of the wickedness of those who live in it? The animals and the birds are swept away, because they have said, “He does not see our future.” 5 “If you run with foot soldiers and they have made you weary, then how will you compete with horses? If you have fallen in a peaceful land, then how will you do in the thickets of the Jordan? 6 For even your relatives, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you, even they call loudly after you. You must not trust in them, though they speak kindly to you. 7 I have forsaken my house, I have abandoned my inheritance. I have given the beloved one of my heart into the hand of her enemies. 8 My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest. She has lifted up against me her voice; therefore I hate her. 9 The lair of the hyena is my inheritance to me, the birds of prey are all around her. Go, gather all of the animals of the field, bring them to come and devour. 10 Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trampled down my plot of land. They have made my pleasant field like the desert of desolation. 11 They have made it a desolation. Desolate, it mourns to me. All the land is made desolate, but there is no person taking it to heart. 12 Upon all the barren heights in the desert destroyers have come, for the sword of Yahweh devours, from one end of the land to the other end of the land, there is no peace for all flesh. 13 They have sown wheat and they have reaped thorns. They are exhausted, they do not profit. And they will be ashamed of your produce, because of the burning anger of Yahweh.” 14 Thus says Yahweh concerning all of the evil neighbors who touch the inheritance that I gave as an inheritance to my people Israel: “Look, I am about to drive them out from their land, and the house of Judah I will drive out from among them. 15 And then after my driving them out, I will once again have compassion on them, and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance, and each one to his land. 16 And then, if they diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, ‘as Yahweh lives,’ even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will live in the midst of my people. 17 But if they do not listen, then I will completely uproot and destroy that nation.” declares Yahweh. 1 Thus Yahweh said to me: “Go and buy for yourself a loincloth of linen and put it on your loins, but you must not place it in water.” 2 So I bought the loincloth according to the word of Yahweh and I put it on my loins. 3 Now the word of Yahweh came to me a second time, saying, 4 “Take the loincloth that you bought, that is on your loins, and stand up, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in the cleft of the rock.” 5 So I went and hid it by the Euphrates just as Yahweh had commanded me. 6 And then, after a long time, then Yahweh said to me, “Stand up, go to the Euphrates and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.” 7 Then I went to the Euphrates and I dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it, and look, the loincloth was ruined; it was not good for anything. 8 And then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 9 “Thus says Yahweh: ‘So I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. 10 This evil people, who refuse to listen to my words, who go in the stubbornness of their hearts, and have gone after other gods, to serve them, and to bow in worship to them, let them be like this loincloth which is not good for anything. 11 For as the loincloth clings to the loins of a person, so I caused to cling to me all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah,’ declares Yahweh, ‘to be for me a people, and a name, and a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.’ 12 “Therefore, you shall say to them this word, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: “Every jar must be filled with wine.” ’ And they will say to you, ‘Do we not certainly know that every jar should be filled with wine?’ 13 Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Look, I am about to fill all the inhabitants of this land, and the kings who sit on David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with drunkenness. 14 And I will smash them, each one against his brother, and the fathers and the sons together,” declares Yahweh. “I will not have compassion, and I will not take pity, and I will not show compassion from destroying them.” ’ ” 15 Listen, and pay attention, you must not be haughty, for Yahweh has spoken. 16 Give glory to Yahweh your God before he brings darkness, and before your feet stumble on the mountains at twilight. And you will hope for light, but he makes it as gloom, he makes it as thick darkness. 17 But if you will not listen to it, my inner self will weep in secret places, because of the presence of your pride. And my eyes will weep bitterly, and they will melt in tears, because the flock of Yahweh has been taken captive. 18 “Say to the king and to the queen mother, ‘Take a lower seat, for your beautiful crown has come down from your head.’ 19 The towns of the Negev are shut up, and there is no one who opens them. All of Judah is deported; it is deported in completeness. 20 Lift up your eyes and see those coming from the north. Where is the flock that was given to you, your magnificent flock? 21 What will you say when he sets over you— and you have taught them—allies as head over you? Will not labor pains take hold of you, like a woman giving birth? 22 And if you say in your heart, ‘Why have these things happened to me?’ Because of the greatness of your iniquity your skirts are uncovered; your heels have endured violence. 23 Can a Cushite change his skin, or a leopard his spots? Then you also will be able to do good, who are accustomed to doing evil. 24 And I will scatter them like stubble scattered by the wind of the desert. 25 This is your lot, the portion of your measure from me,” declares Yahweh, “because you have forgotten me, and you have trusted in the lie. 26 So in turn I will bare your skirts over your face, and your shame will become visible. 27 Your adulteries, and your neighings, the shameful behavior of your fornications on the hills in the countryside, I have seen your abominations. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! How long will you continue to be unclean?” 1 That which came as the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah concerning the matter of the severe drought. 2 “Judah mourns, and her gates languish, they are in mourning on the ground, and the cry of lament of Jerusalem goes up. 3 And their nobles send their servants for water. They come to the pits, they find no water. They return with their vessels empty. They are ashamed, and they are confounded, and they cover their heads. 4 Because of the ground, which is cracked because there was no rain on the ground. The farmers are ashamed, they cover their heads. 5 For even the doe in the field gives birth and forsakes her young, because there is no green growth. 6 And wild asses stand on the barren heights, they gasp for breath like the jackals. Their eyes fail because there is no vegetation.” 7 Although our iniquities testify against us, O Yahweh, act for the sake of your name. Yes, our apostasies are many; we have sinned against you. 8 You are the hope of Israel, its savior in time of distress. Why should you be like an alien in the land, or like a traveler who spreads out his tent to spend the night? 9 Why should you be like a confused man, like a warrior who is not able to help? Yet you are in our midst, O Yahweh, and your name is called upon us. You must not leave us! 10 Thus says Yahweh concerning this people: “They have loved so much to wander, they have not spared their feet. Therefore Yahweh is not favorable to them, now he will remember their iniquity and punish their sins.” 11 So Yahweh said to me, “You must not pray for this people, for their happiness. 12 Although they fast, I am not listening to their cry of entreaty. And although they present burnt offering and grain offering, I am not favorable to them. But by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague, I am about to destroy them.” 13 Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh, look, the prophets are saying to them, ‘You will not see the sword, and famine will not be yours, but reliable peace I will give to you in this place.’ ” ",Jeremiah 11:6-14:13,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-116-1413-62557/direct-download/tbd20090708.mp3
Jeremiah,"4 Because of the ground, which is cracked because there was no rain on the ground. The farmers are ashamed, they cover their heads. 5 For even the doe in the field gives birth and forsakes her young, because there is no green growth. 6 And wild asses stand on the barren heights, they gasp for breath like the jackals.

I have not sent them, and I have not commanded them, and I have not spoken to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, and a divination, worthless, and the deceitfulness of their minds.” 15 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who prophecy in my name though I have not sent them, yet they are saying, “Sword and famine will not be in this land.” “By the sword and by the famine those prophets will perish. 16 And the people to whom they are prophesying will be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword. And there will be no one who buries them, their wives, or their sons, or their daughters. And I will pour out on them their wickedness. 17 “And you shall say to them this word, ‘Let my eyes melt with tears night and day, and let them not cease, for with a great wound the virgin daughter of my people is broken, with a very incurable wound. 18 If I go out into the field, then look, those slain by the sword. And if I enter the city, then look, the sickness of the famine. For both prophet and priest wander around through the land, they do not know what is going on.’ ” 19 Have you completely rejected Judah? Or has your soul loathed Zion? Why have you struck us so that there is no healing for us? We hope for peace, but there is no good, and for a time of healing, but look, there is terror. 20 We know, O Yahweh, our wickedness, the iniquity of our ancestors, for we have sinned against you. 21 You must not spurn us for the sake of your name, you must not dishonor your glorious throne. Remember us! You must not break your covenant with us. 22 Are there any among the idols of the nation who cause rain to pour? Or can the heavens give showers? Is it not you, O Yahweh our God? Therefore, we hope in you, for you do all these things. 1 Then Yahweh said to me, “Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me, my heart would not be to this people. Send them away from my sight, and let them go out. 2 And then if they say to you, ‘Where shall we go?’ Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Those who are destined for the plague, to the plague, and those who are destined for the sword, to the sword, and those who are destined for the famine, to the famine, and those who are destined for the captivity, to the captivity.” ’ 3 “And I will summon over them four types of calamity,” declares Yahweh, “the sword to kill, and the dogs to drag away, and the birds of the air and the wild animals of the earth to devour and to destroy. 4 And I will make them a terror to all of the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, because of what he did in Jerusalem. 5 “For who will have compassion on you, O Jerusalem, or who will show sympathy to you, or who will turn aside to ask about your welfare? 6 You have forsaken me,” declares Yahweh. “You go backward, so I have stretched my hand against you, and I have destroyed you. I am tired of becoming remorseful. 7 And I have winnowed them with a winnowing fork in the gates of the land. I am bereaved. I have destroyed my people. They did not turn back from their ways. 8 Their widows will be more numerous before me than the sand of the seas. I have brought to them, against the mothers of young men, a destroyer at noon. I will suddenly drop on her anguish and horror. 9 She who gave birth to seven has withered away. She gasps her breath. Her sun set while still day. She has been put to shame and disgraced. And the remainder of them I will give to the sword before their enemies,” declares Yahweh. 10 Woe to me, O my mother, that you gave birth to me, a man of contention and quarreling to the whole land. I have not lent out and I have not borrowed. All of them are cursing me. 11 Yahweh said, “Surely I will set you free to be good for you, surely I will cause the enemy to intercede with you in a time of trouble, and in a time of distress. 12 Can anyone break iron, iron from the north, or bronze? 13 I will give your wealth and your treasures as plunder without price, even because of all your sins, and throughout all your territories. 14 And I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, for a fire will kindle in my anger. Upon you it will be kindled.” 15 You who know, O Yahweh, remember me, and attend to me, and take revenge for me against my persecutors in your forbearance. You must take me away. Know that I am carrying disgrace because of you. 16 Your words were found and I ate them, and your words became to me as jubilation, even as the joy of my heart, for your name is called on me, O Yahweh God of hosts. 17 I sat not in the assembly of jokers, nor did I exult. Because of the presence of your hand I sat alone, for you filled me with indignation. 18 Why is my pain endless, and my wound incurable? It refuses to become healed. Truly you are to me like a deceitful brook, waters that are not trustworthy. 19 Therefore thus says Yahweh, “If you turn back, then I will take you back. You will stand before me. And if you utter what is precious and not what is worthless, you will be as my mouth. They will turn back to you, and you will not turn back to them. 20 And I will make you to this people a wall of fortified bronze, and they will fight against you, but they will not prevail over you, for I am with you, to save you, and to deliver you,” declares Yahweh. 21 “And I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you from the hand of the tyrant.” 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 2 “You shall not take for yourself a wife, there shall not be for you sons and daughters in this place.” 3 For thus says Yahweh concerning the sons and concerning the daughters born in this place, and concerning their mothers who gave birth to them, and concerning their fathers who fathered them in this land: 4 “They will die by diseases, they will not be mourned, and they will not be buried. They will be as dung on the face of the earth. And they will perish by the sword and they will perish by the famine. And their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the air, and for the wild animals of the earth.” 5 For thus says Yahweh, “You must not enter the house of the funeral meal, and you must not go to lament, and you must not show sympathy for them, for I have taken away my peace from this people,” declares Yahweh, “the loyal love and the compassion. 6 Both the great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried, and they will not mourn for them, and no one will cut himself with a blade, and no one will shave himself for them. 7 And they will not break bread for the mourning ceremony for them, to comfort him because of the dead. And they will not give drink to them, the cup of desolation, for their fathers, or for their mothers. 8 And you shall not enter the house of the banquet, to sit with them, to eat and drink.” 9 For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Look, I am about to cause to disappear from this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of jubilation, and the voice of joy, and the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. 10 And then when you tell this people all these words and they ask you, ‘Why has Yahweh pronounced against us all this great evil, and what is our iniquity, and what is our sin that we have sinned against Yahweh our God?’ 11 Then you shall say to them, ‘Because your ancestors have forsaken me,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and they have gone after other gods, and they have served them, and they have bowed down in worship to them, and they have forsaken me, and they have not kept my laws. 12 And you have behaved badly more than your ancestors, and look, you are going each one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, without listening to me. 13 So I will throw you from this land to the land that you have not known, you or your ancestors, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will not show you favor. 14 Therefore look, days are coming,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and it will no longer be said, “As Yahweh lives, who led up the Israelites from the land of Egypt,” 15 but only “As Yahweh lives, who led up the Israelites from the land of the north, and from all the lands where he had driven them,” for I will bring them back to their ground that I gave to their ancestors. 16 Look, I am sending for many fishermen,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and they will fish them out, and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and from the clefts of the cliffs. 17 For my eyes are on all their ways, they are not hidden from before me, and their iniquity is not concealed from before my eyes. 18 And I will first doubly repay their iniquity and their sin because of their profaning my land with the dead bodies of their abhorrences, and with their abominations they have filled up my inheritance.’ ” 19 O Yahweh, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of distress, to you the nations will come from the ends of the earth, and they will say, “Our ancestors have inherited only lies, vanity, and there is no profit in them. 20 Can a human make for himself gods? Yet they are not gods!” 21 “Therefore look, I am about to let them know, this time I am going to let them know my power and my might, and they will know that my name is Yahweh.” 1 “The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus, with a point of diamond it is engraved on the tablet of their heart, and on the horns of their altars. 2 As the remembering of their children, so is the remembering of their altars and their poles of Asherah worship beside the leafy trees on the high hills. 3 O my mountain in the open country, I will give your wealth, all your treasures, for spoil, your high places, because of your sin, throughout all your territories. 4 And you will let go your hand from your inheritance that I gave to you, and I will make you serve your enemies in the land that you do not know, for you kindled a fire in my anger, until eternity it will be kindled.” 5 Thus says Yahweh, “Cursed is the person who trusts in humankind and makes flesh his strength, and turns aside his heart from Yahweh. 6 And he will be like a juniper in the wilderness, and he will not see when good comes, and he will dwell in the parched places in the desert, in a land of salt flats, where no one lives. 7 Blessed be the person who trusts in Yahweh, and Yahweh is his trust. 8 For he will be like a tree planted by water, and to the stream it sends its roots, and it will not fear when heat comes, and its leaves will be luxuriant, and in the year of drought it will not be anxious, and it will not cease from the bearing of fruit. 9 The heart is deceitful more than anything else, and it is disastrous. Who can understand it? 10 I, Yahweh, examine the mind, I test the heart, and give to each one according to his way, according to the fruit of his deeds. 11 Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay is one who amasses wealth without justice. In the middle of his days it will leave him, and at his end he will prove to be a fool.” 12 A lofty throne of glory from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary. 13 O Yahweh, the hope of Israel, all those who forsake you will be put to shame, and those who turn aside from you in the earth will be recorded, for they have forsaken the fountain of living water, Yahweh. 14 Heal me, O Yahweh, and I will be healed, save me, and I will be saved, for you are my praise. 15 Look, they are saying to me, “Where is the word of Yahweh? Please let it come.” 16 But I, I have not run away from being a shepherd who follows you, and I have not desired the disastrous day. You, you know the pronouncement of my lips, it was before your face. 17 You must not become to me a terror, you are my refuge in the day of disaster. 18 Let my persecutors be put to shame, but as for me, do not let me be put to shame. Let them be dismayed, but as for me, do not let me be dismayed. Bring on them the day of disaster, and with double destruction, destroy them. 19 Thus said Yahweh to me, “Go, and you must stand in the People’s Gate through which the kings of Judah enter, and through which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem. 20 And you must say to them, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem who enter through these gates. 21 Thus says Yahweh, “Be on your guard for the sake of yourselves, that you must not carry a burden on the day of the Sabbath, and you must not bring it through the gates of Jerusalem. 22 And you must not carry a burden from your houses on the day of the Sabbath, and you must not do any work. But you must declare holy the day of Sabbath, just as I commanded your ancestors. 23 Yet they did not listen, and they did not incline their ear, and they hardened their neck so as to not hear, nor to receive discipline. 24 “And it will happen, if you carefully listen to me,” declares Yahweh, “to bring no burden through the gates of this city on the day of the Sabbath, but to declare holy the day of Sabbath, not to do on it any work, 25 then kings and officials who sit on the throne of David will enter through the gates of this city riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their officials, the people of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever. 26 And they will come from the towns of Judah, and from all around Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the Shephelah, and from the hill country, and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and grain offerings, and frankincense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of Yahweh. 27 But if you do not listen to me, to declare holy the day of the Sabbath, and to not carry a burden and enter through the gates of Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it will not be quenched.” ’ ” ",Jeremiah 14:4-17:27,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-144-1727-62558/direct-download/tbd20090709.mp3
Jeremiah,"1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, 2 “Stand up and go down to the house of the potter, and there I will let you hear my words.” 3 So I went down to the house of the potter and look, there he was doing work at the potter’s wheels. 4 And the vessel that he was making with the clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter, so he made again another vessel, as it was right in the eyes of the potter to make. 5 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 6 “Like this potter, am I not able to do to you, O house of Israel?” declares Yahweh. “Look, like the clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. 7 One moment I speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom, to uproot, and to tear down, and to destroy it. 8 But if that nation turns back from its evil that I have threatened against it, then I will relent concerning the disaster that I planned to do to it. 9 And the next moment I speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom, to build, and to plant it. 10 But if it does evil in my sight, to not listen to my voice, then I will relent concerning the good that I said I would do to it. 11 “So now then, say, please, to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Look, I am preparing evil against you, and I am planning a plan against you. Please turn back, each one from his evil way, and walk rightly in your ways and your deeds.” ’ 12 But they will say, ‘It is hopeless, for we will go after our own plans, and each one of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’ 13 “Therefore thus says Yahweh, ‘Please ask among the nations, “Who has heard the like of this?” The virgin of Israel has done something very horrible. 14 Does the snow of Lebanon leave from the crags of Sirion? Or are the cold waters flowing from distant mountains dried up? 15 But my people have forgotten me. They make smoke offerings to the idols, and they caused them to stumble in their ways, the ancient ways, to go into bypaths, not one that is built up. 16 To make their land a horror, an object of whistling for eternity. All who pass by it will be appalled, and he will shake his head. 17 Like the wind from the east I will scatter them before the enemy. I will show them my back and not my face in the day of their disaster.’ ” 18 Then they said, “Come and let us plan plans against Jeremiah, for instruction will not be lost from the priest, nor advice from the wise man, nor the word from the prophet. Come and let us bring charges against him, and let us not listen attentively to any of his words.” 19 Listen attentively to me, O Yahweh, and listen to the voice of my opponents. 20 Should good be repaid in place of evil? Yet they have dug a pit for me. Remember my standing before you to speak good for them, to avert your wrath from them. 21 Therefore give their children to the famine, and hand them over to the power of the sword, and let their wives be bereaved and widows, and let their men be killed by death, their young men struck dead by the sword in the battle. 22 Let a cry for help be heard from their houses when you suddenly bring upon them the raiding band, for they have dug a pit to catch me, and they have fixed secretly a trap for my feet. 23 But you, O Yahweh, you know all their plans of assassination against me. You must not make atonement for their iniquity, and you must not cause their sin to be blotted out from before you. But let them be overthrown before you. Deal with them in the time of your anger. 1 Thus said Yahweh, “Go and buy a potter’s earthenware jar, and take some of the elders of the people, and some of the leaders of the priests, 2 and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, which is at the entrance of the Gate of the Potsherd, and proclaim there the words that I speak to you. 3 And you shall say, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Look, I am about to bring disaster upon this place so that everyone who hears it, his ears will ring. 4 Because they have forsaken me, and they have defaced this place, and they have made smoke offerings in it to other gods whom they have not known, they, nor their ancestors, nor the kings of Judah, and they have filled up this place with the blood of the innocent, 5 and they have built the high places of Baal, to burn their children in the fire, burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, and I ordered not, and it did not come to my mind. 6 “Therefore look, days are about to come,” declares Yahweh, “when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of the Slaughter. 7 And I will lay waste the plans of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will bring them to ruin by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life, and I will give their dead bodies as food to the birds of heaven and to the animals of the earth. 8 And I will make this city a horror, and an object of hissing, everyone who passes by it will be appalled, and will hiss because of all its wounds. 9 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons, and the flesh of their daughters, and each one will eat the flesh of his neighbor in the siege and in the distress which their enemies and those who seek their life inflict on them.” ’ 10 “Then you shall break the jar before the eyes of the men who go with you. 11 And you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts: “So I will break this people and this city as one breaks the vessel of the potter, so that it is not able to be repaired again. And in Topheth they will bury until there is no room to bury. 12 Thus will I do to this place,” declares Yahweh, “and to its inhabitants, to make this city like Topheth. 13 And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be unclean like the place of Topheth, all the houses where they made smoke offerings upon their roofs to all the host of heaven, and where they poured out libations to other gods.” ’ ” 14 Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the courtyard of the house of Yahweh and said to all the people, 15 “Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Look, I am about to bring to this city and upon all its towns all the disaster that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their neck to not hear my words.’ ” ",Jeremiah 18-19,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-18-19-62559/direct-download/tbd20090710.mp3
Jeremiah,"1 Now Pashhur, the son of Immer, the priest who was officer in charge in the temple of Yahweh, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. 2 Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Gate of Benjamin, which was by the temple of Yahweh. 3 And then on the next day, when Pashhur brought Jeremiah out from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “Yahweh will not call your name Pashhur, but Terror From All Around. 4 For thus says Yahweh, ‘Look, I am making you a terror to yourself and to all your friends, and they will fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes will be seeing it. And all Judah I will give into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will deport them to Babylon, and he will strike them with the sword. 5 And I will give all the wealth of this city, and all its acquisitions, and all its precious items, and all of the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give into the hand of their enemies, and they will plunder them, and they will seize them, and they will bring them to Babylon. 6 And you, Pashhur, and all those who live in your house will go into captivity, and you will go to Babylon, and there you will die, and there you will be buried, you, and all your friends to whom you have prophesied falsely.’ ” 7 You have persuaded me, O Yahweh, and I was persuaded. You have overpowered me, and you have prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long. Everyone is mocking me. 8 For as often as I speak, I must cry out violence and destruction. I must shout, for the word of Yahweh has become for me a disgrace and derision all day long. 9 But if I say, “I will not mention him and I will no longer speak in his name,” then it becomes in my heart like a fire burning, locked up in my bones, and I struggle to contain it, and I am not able. 10 For I hear the rumor of many, “Terror is from all around, denounce him, yes, let us denounce him!” All my close friends are watchers of my stumbling, saying, “perhaps he can be persuaded, and we can prevail over him, and we can take our revenge on him.” 11 But Yahweh is with me like a powerful warrior. Therefore my persecutors will stumble and will not prevail. They will be very ashamed, for they will not achieve success. Their everlasting insult will not be forgotten. 12 Yet, O Yahweh of hosts, who tests the righteous, who sees the heart and the mind, let me see your retribution upon them, for to you I have revealed my legal case. 13 Sing to Yahweh, praise Yahweh, for he has delivered the life of the poor from the hand of evildoers. 14 Cursed be the day on which I was born, let not the day on which my mother gave birth to me be blessed. 15 Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, saying, “A child is born to you, a son!” and he made him very glad. 16 And let that man be like the cities that Yahweh demolished without regret, and let him hear a cry for help in the morning, and an alarm at the time of noon. 17 Because he did not kill me in the womb, so that my mother would have been for me my grave, and her womb would be pregnant forever. 18 Why did I come out from the womb, to see toil, and sorrow, and to end my days in shame? 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur, the son of Malchiah, and Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying, 2 “Please inquire of Yahweh on behalf of us, for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon is fighting against us. Perhaps Yahweh will do with us according to all his miraculous acts, so that he may withdraw from us.” 3 Then Jeremiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to Zedekiah: 4 ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: “Look, I am about to turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you are fighting against them, the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are laying siege to you from outside the wall, and I will gather them into the center of this city. 5 And I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand, and with strong arm, and in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. 6 And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both humankind and animal; by a great plague they will die. 7 And afterward,” declares Yahweh, “I will give Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and those who remain in this city from the plague, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their lives, and he will strike them with the edge of the sword. He will not take pity on them, and he will not have compassion, nor will he show compassion.” ’ 8 “And to this people you shall say, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Look, I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death. 9 He who stays in this city will die by the sword, or by the famine, or by the plague. And he who goes out and goes over to the Chaldeans who are laying siege to you will live, and his life will be to him as booty. 10 For I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good,” declares Yahweh. It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.” ’ 11 “And to the house of the king of Judah, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, 12 O house of David, thus says Yahweh, “Execute judgment in the morning, justice, and deliver the one who has been seized from the hand of the oppressor, lest my wrath goes forth like the fire and it burns, and there is no one who quenches it because of the evil of your deeds. 13 Look, I am against you, O inhabitants of the valley, O rock of the plain,” declares Yahweh; “you who say, ‘Who can descend against us, or who can enter into our hiding place?’ 14 And I will punish you according to the fruit of your deeds,” declares Yahweh, “And I will kindle a fire in its forest, and it will devour all its surroundings.” ’ ” 1 Thus says Yahweh: “Go down to the house of the king of Judah and you must speak this word there. 2 And you must say, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter through these gates. 3 Thus says Yahweh, “Act with justice and righteousness, and deliver the one who has been seized from the hand of the oppressor. And you must not oppress or treat violently the immigrant, the orphan, and the widow. And you must not shed innocent blood in this place. 4 And if you indeed obey this word, then kings who sit for David on his throne will enter through the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. 5 But if you do not obey these words, I swear by myself,” declares Yahweh, “that this house will become a site of ruins.” ’ ” 6 For thus says Yahweh concerning the house of the king of Judah, “You are like Gilead to me, like the head of the Lebanon. Surely I will make you a desert, like cities that are not inhabited. 7 And I will consecrate against you destroyers, everyone with his weapons, and they will cut down your choicest cedars, and cast them on the fire. 8 And many nations will pass by this city and they will say each one to his neighbor, ‘Why has Yahweh done in this manner to this great city?’ 9 Then they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God, and bowed down in worship to other gods, and served them.’ ” 10 You must not weep for the dead person, and you must not show sympathy for him. Weep bitterly for the one who goes away, for he will not return, or see the land of his birth again. 11 For thus says Yahweh concerning Shallum, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, who reigned as king in place of Josiah his father, who went out from this place: “He will not return here again. 12 But in the place where they have deported him, there he will die, and he will not see this land again. 13 Woe to the one who builds his house without righteousness, and his upper rooms without justice. His fellow countryman, he works for nothing, and he does not give to him his wages. 14 Who says ‘I will build for myself a spacious house with large upper rooms,’ and he cuts windows for it, and it is paneled with cedar, and he paints it with vermilion. 15 Do you reign as king because you are competing in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink, and he did justice and righteousness, then it was well with him? 16 He judged the legal cause of the needy and the poor, and then it was well. Is that not what it means to know me?” declares Yahweh. 17 “But there is nothing in your eyes and your heart except your unlawful gain, and on shedding the blood of the innocent, and on committing oppression and extortion.” 18 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah: “They will not lament for him, ‘Alas, my brother,’ or ‘Alas, sister.’ They will not lament for him, ‘Alas, lord,’ or ‘alas, his majesty.’ 19 He will be buried with the burial of a donkey. He will be dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem. 20 Go up to Lebanon and cry out, and in Bashan lift up your voice, and cry out from Abarim, for all your lovers are shattered. 21 I spoke to you in the times you were secure, and you said, ‘I will not listen!’ This was your way from your youth, for you have not obeyed my voice. 22 All your shepherds will shepherd the wind, and your lovers will go into captivity. Yes, then you will be ashamed and humiliated because of all your wickedness. 23 Inhabitants of Lebanon, nestled among the cedars, how you will groan when labor pains come to you, anguish as the woman who gives birth. 24 “As I live,” declares Yahweh, “surely if Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were the seal on my right hand, surely from there I would wrench you off. 25 And I would give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of those from whom you are frightened by their presence, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 26 And I will throw you and your mother who gave birth to you to another country where you were not born, and there you will die. 27 As for the land to which they are longing to return, they will not return. 28 Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered vessel? Or a vessel in which there is no delight? Why are he and his offspring thrown far, and cast away to the land that they do not know?” 29 O land, land, land, hear the word of Yahweh. 30 Thus says Yahweh: “Record this man as childless, a man who will not succeed in his days, for no man from his offspring will succeed him, sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah.” ",Jeremiah 20-22,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-20-22-62560/direct-download/tbd20090713.mp3
Jeremiah,"13 Woe to the one who builds his house without righteousness, and his upper rooms without justice. His fellow countryman, he works for nothing, and he does not give to him his wages. 14 Who says ‘I will build for myself a spacious house with large upper rooms,’ and he cuts windows for it, and it is paneled with cedar, and he paints it with vermilion. 15 Do you reign as king because you are competing in cedar? Did not your father eat and drink, and he did justice and righteousness, then it was well with him? 16 He judged the legal cause of the needy and the poor, and then it was well.

Or a vessel in which there is no delight? Why are he and his offspring thrown far, and cast away to the land that they do not know?” 29 O land, land, land, hear the word of Yahweh. 30 Thus says Yahweh: “Record this man as childless, a man who will not succeed in his days, for no man from his offspring will succeed him, sitting on the throne of David and ruling again in Judah.” 1 “Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the flock of my pasture,” declares Yahweh. 2 Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people, “You yourselves have scattered my flock, and you have driven them away, and you do not attend to them. Look, I will punish you for the evil of your deeds,” declares Yahweh. 3 “Then I myself will gather together the remnant of my flock from all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their grazing place, and they will be fruitful, and they will become numerous. 4 And I will raise up over them shepherds, and they will shepherd them, and they will no longer fear, and they will not be dismayed, and they will not be missing,” declares Yahweh. 5 “Look, days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “when I will raise up for David a righteous branch, and he will reign as king, and he will achieve success, and he will do justice and righteousness in the land. 6 In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell in safety, and this is his name by which he will be called: ‘Yahweh is our righteousness.’ 7 “Therefore look, days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “when they will no longer say, ‘As Yahweh lives, who led up the Israelites from the land of Egypt,’ 8 but ‘As Yahweh lives, who led up, and who brought the offspring of the house of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands where he had driven them.’ Then they will live in their land.” 9 Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken in my midst. All my bones tremble. I have become like a drunken man, even like a man over whom wine has passed, because of Yahweh, and because of his holy words. 10 For the land is full of adulterers; for the land mourns because of a curse. The pastures of the desert are dry, and their evil has been their way of running, and their power is not right. 11 “For both prophet as well as priest are godless, even in my temple I have found their wickedness,” declares Yahweh. 12 “Therefore their way will be to them like the slippery places, they will be pushed in the darkness, and they will fall into it, for I will bring disaster on them in the year of their punishment,” declares Yahweh. 13 “Now in the prophets of Samaria I saw a disgusting thing. They prophesied by Baal and they caused my people Israel to err. 14 And in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen something horrible. They commit adultery, and they walk in lies, and they make strong the hands of evildoers, so that they have not turned back each from his wickedness. All of them have become to me like Sodom, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.” 15 Therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts concerning the prophets: “Look, I am going to let them eat wormwood and I will give them water of poison to drink, for from the prophets of Jerusalem went out ungodliness to all the land.” 16 Thus says Yahweh of hosts: “You must not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They are deluding you with visions of their mind, They do not speak from the mouth of Yahweh. 17 They are continually saying to those who disregard the word of Yahweh, ‘Peace it will be to you,’ and to each one who walks in the stubbornness of his heart they say, ‘Calamity will not come upon you.’ 18 For who has stood in the council of Yahweh, that he has seen and heard his word? Who has listened attentively to his word and heard it? 19 Look, the storm of Yahweh has gone forth in wrath, even a whirling tempest. It will whirl upon the head of the wicked. 20 The anger of Yahweh will not turn back until his doing and until his keeping the plans of his mind. In latter days you will look closely at it with understanding. 21 I have not sent the prophets, yet they ran. I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. 22 But if they had stood in my council, then they would have proclaimed my words to my people, and they would have caused them to turn from their evil way, and from the evil of their deeds. 23 Am I a God from near,” declares Yahweh, “and not a God from far? 24 Or can a person hide himself in secret places and I cannot see him?” declares Yahweh. “Do I not fill up the heaven and the earth?” declares Yahweh. 25 “I have heard what the prophets who prophesy lies have said in my name, saying, ‘I have dreamed! I have dreamed!’ 26 How long will this be in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceitfulness of their hearts, 27 who plan to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell each one to his neighbor, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal? 28 The prophet who has with him a dream, let him tell the dream. But the prophet who has my word with him, let him speak my word faithfully. What is straw compared to wheat?” declares Yahweh. 29 “Is not my word like fire?” declares Yahweh, “and like a blacksmith’s hammer that breaks a rock into pieces? 30 “Therefore look, I am against the prophets,” declares Yahweh, “who steal my words each one from his neighbor. 31 Look, I am against the prophets,” declares Yahweh, “who take their tongues and declare as prophets, ‘Yahweh declares.’ 32 Look, I am against those who prophesy dreams of lies,” declares Yahweh, “and tell them, and they caused my people to err through their lies, and in their recklessness, when I myself have not sent them nor commanded them, so they profit not this people at all,” declares Yahweh. 33 “Now when this people, or a prophet, or a priest, ask you, saying, ‘What is the burden of Yahweh?’ then you shall say to them, ‘You are the burden, and I will forsake you, declares Yahweh.’ 34 And the prophet, and the priest, and the people who say, ‘The burden of Yahweh,’ I will punish that man and his house. 35 Thus you shall say, each one to his neighbor and each one to his brother: ‘What has Yahweh answered?’ or, ‘What has Yahweh spoken?’ 36 But the burden of Yahweh you shall not mention again, for the burden is to each one his word, and so you twist the words of the living God, Yahweh of hosts, our God. 37 Thus you shall say to that prophet: ‘What has Yahweh answered you?’ or, ‘What has Yahweh spoken?’ 38 But if you say, ‘The burden of Yahweh,’ therefore thus says Yahweh: ‘Because of your saying these words, “The burden of Yahweh,” then I will send to you, saying, “You shall not say, ‘The burden of Yahweh.’ ” ’ 39 Therefore look, here I am, and I will surely lift you up and forsake you and the city that I gave to you and to your ancestors from my presence, 40 and I will bring upon you an everlasting disgrace and an everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.” 1 Yahweh showed me, and look, there were two baskets of figs placed before the temple of Yahweh—after Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had deported Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, with the officials of Judah, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon. 2 The one basket had very good figs, like early figs, and the other basket had very bad figs that could not be eaten because of their bad quality. 3 And Yahweh asked me, “What are you seeing, Jeremiah?” And I said, “Figs—the good figs, very good, and the bad figs, very bad, that cannot be eaten because of their bad quality.” 4 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 5 “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles of Judah whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans. 6 For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. And I will build them and not annihilate them, and I will plant them and not uproot them. 7 And I will give to them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh, and they will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me with the whole of their heart. 8 But like the bad figs that cannot be eaten because of their bad quality—for thus says Yahweh—so I will treat Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who live in the land of Egypt. 9 And I will make them as a terror, an evil to all the kingdoms of the earth, as a disgrace and a proverb, as a taunt and a curse, in all the places where I will drive them. 10 And I will send among them the sword, the famine, and the plague, until they perish from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors.’ ” 1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, 2 which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 3 “From the thirteenth year of Josiah, the son of Amon, the king of Judah, even up to this day, these twenty-three years the word of Yahweh has come to me, and I have spoken to you over and over again, but you have not listened. 4 And though Yahweh has sent all his servants the prophets to you over and over again you have not listened, and you have not inclined your ear to hear, 5 saying, ‘Turn back please, each one from his evil way, and from the evil of your deeds, and live on the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your ancestors from a long time back and until forever, 6 and you must not go after other gods to serve them, and to bow in worship to them, and you must not provoke me to anger with the work of your hands, then I will not do something bad to you.’ 7 ‘Yet you have not listened to me,’ declares Yahweh, ‘so that you have provoked me to anger with the work of your hands for your own harm.’ 8 Therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts, ‘Because you have not obeyed my words, 9 look, I am going to send and take all the clans of the north,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations all around, and I will destroy them, and I will make them a horror, and an object of hissing, and everlasting ruins. 10 And I will exterminate from them the sound of jubilation, and the sound of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp. 11 And all this land will become a site of ruins, a desolation, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years. 12 And then when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,’ declares Yahweh, ‘for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and I will make it an everlasting waste. 13 And I will bring upon that land all my words that I have spoken against it, everything that is written in this scroll which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations. 14 For many nations and great kings will let them work, even them, and I will repay them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.’ ” ",Jeremiah 22:13-25:14,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-2213-2514-62561/direct-download/tbd20090714.mp3
Jeremiah,"15 For thus said Yahweh, the God of Israel, to me, “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from my hand, and you must give it to all the nations to whom I am sending you to drink. 16 And they will drink, and they will stagger, and they will act like madmen because of the presence of the sword that I am sending among them.” 17 So I took the cup from the hand of Yahweh and I gave it to all the nations to whom Yahweh sent me to drink: 18 Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, and its kings, and its officials, to make them a site of ruins, a horror, an object of hissing, and a curse, as it is this day; 19 Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and his servants, and his officials, and all his people; 20 and all the other people; and all the kings of the land of Uz; and all the kings of the land of the Philistines—Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; 21 Edom, and Moab, and the Ammonites; 22 and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastland that is across the sea; 23 and Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all those who are trimmed to the side; 24 and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the other people who dwell in the desert; 25 and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media; 26 and all the kings of the north, near and far, each one to his brother, and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the face of the earth; and the king of Sheshach, he will drink after them. 27 “And you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Drink and become drunk, and vomit, and fall, and you must not rise because of the presence of the sword that I am sending among you.” ’ 28 And it will happen, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “You must certainly drink! 29 For look, on the city that is called by my name I am beginning to inflict harm, and you indeed, will you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth,” declares Yahweh of hosts.’ 30 And you yourself shall prophesy against them all these words, and you shall say to them: ‘Yahweh will roar from on high, and from his holy dwelling place he will give his voice. He will roar mightily against his settlement, a jubilant shout like those who tread grapes, he will answer against all the inhabitants of the earth. 31 The rage of battle will resound to the end of the earth, for there is a lawsuit of Yahweh against the nations. He is entering into judgment with all wicked flesh, he will give them to the sword,’ declares Yahweh.” 32 Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “Look, disaster is going out from nation to nation, and a great tempest is stirred up from the farthest parts of the earth. 33 And the slain ones of Yahweh will be on that day from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth, and they will not be mourned, and they will not be gathered, and they will not be buried. They will become like dung on the surface of the ground. 34 Wail, you shepherds, and cry out. And roll about in mourning in the dust, O leaders of the flock. For your days of slaughter and your dispersions have arrived, and you will fall like a vessel of desire. 35 And flight will perish from the shepherds, and escape from the leaders of the flock. 36 A sound, the cry of distress of the shepherds and the wailing of the leaders of the flock, for Yahweh is despoiling their pasture. 37 And the peaceful settlements are devastated because of the burning anger of Yahweh. 38 He has left his den like a lion, for their land has become a horror, because of the anger of the oppressors, and because of his burning anger.” 1 At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came from Yahweh, saying, 2 “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Stand in the courtyard of the house of Yahweh, and you must speak to all the cities of Judah that come to bow in worship in the house of Yahweh all the words that I command you to speak to them. You must not omit a word. 3 Perhaps they will listen and turn back each from his evil way, and I will relent of the disaster that I am planning to do to them because of their evil deeds. 4 And you shall say to them, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you, 5 to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I have sent to you, over and over again, though you have not listened, 6 then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city I will make a curse for all the nations of the earth.’ ” ’ ” 7 And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the temple of Yahweh. 8 And then as Jeremiah finished speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, “You will die! 9 Why have you prophesied in the name of Yahweh, saying, ‘This house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be in ruins, without inhabitant’?” And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the temple of Yahweh. 10 When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the house of the king to the temple of Yahweh, and they sat in the entrance of the New Gate of Yahweh’s temple. 11 Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, saying, “This man deserves the death sentence, because he has prophesied against this city as that which you have heard with your ears.” 12 Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and to all the people, saying, “Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard. 13 Now therefore amend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of Yahweh your God, and Yahweh will relent of the disaster that he has spoken over you. 14 But as for me, look, I am in your hand, do to me what is good and right in your eyes. 15 Only you must certainly know that if you put me to death, you will bring on yourselves innocent blood, and on this city and on its inhabitants, for truly Yahweh sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.” 16 Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, “This man does not deserve a sentence of death, for in the name of Yahweh our God, he has spoken to us.” 17 Then men from the elders of the land arose and said to all the assembly of the people, saying, 18 “Micah the Morashtite was prophesying in the days of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and he said to all the people of Judah, saying: ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts: “Zion will be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the temple as high places of wood.” ’ 19 Did Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and all Judah actually put him to death? Was he not in fear of Yahweh? And he entreated the face of Yahweh, and Yahweh relented of the disaster that he had spoken against them. But we are about to do great disaster to ourselves.” 20 Indeed, there also was a man prophesying in the name of Yahweh, Uriah, the son of Shemaiah, from Kiriath-Jearim, and he prophesied against this city and against this land like all the words of Jeremiah. 21 And when King Jehoiakim, and all his warriors, and all the officials heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death. But Uriah heard, and he was afraid, and he fled and went to Egypt. 22 Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt. Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and men with him went to Egypt. 23 And they brought out Uriah from Egypt and they brought him to King Jehoiakim, and he struck him down with the sword, and he threw his dead body into the burial sites of the sons of the people. 24 However, the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hand of the people to put him to death. 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying— 2 thus said Yahweh to me—“Make for yourself fetters and yokes and put them on your neck, 3 and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon in the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem, to Zedekiah, the king of Judah. 4 And you must command them for their masters, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, this you shall say to your masters: 5 “I have made the earth with humankind and animals that are on the face of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and I give it to whomever is right in my eyes. 6 And now I myself have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and also the animals of the field I have given to him to serve him. 7 And all the nations will serve him, and his son, and his grandson, until the coming of the time of his own land. Then many nations and great kings will let him work. 8 “But it will be that the nation or kingdom that will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put his neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, and with the famine, and with the plague,” declares Yahweh, “until I have destroyed it with my hand. 9 And you, you must not listen to your prophets, and to your diviners, and to your dreamers, and to your interpreters of signs, and to your sorcerers who are saying, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’ 10 For they are prophesying to you a lie, so that you will be removed from your land, and I will drive you away, and you will perish. 11 But the nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and will serve him, yet will I leave it on its land,” declares Yahweh, “and they will till it, and they will live in it.” ’ ” 12 And I spoke words like these to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. 13 Why should you die—you and your people—by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 14 And you must not listen to the words of the prophets who are speaking to you, saying, ‘You must not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying a lie to you. 15 For I have not sent them,” declares Yahweh, “but they are prophesying in my name falsely, so that I will drive them away. And you will perish—you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.” 16 Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘You must not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, “Look, the vessels of the house of Yahweh are about to be quickly brought back from Babylon”, for they are prophesying a lie to you. 17 And you must not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a site of ruins? 18 But if they are prophets, and if there is with them the word of Yahweh, let them please plead with Yahweh of hosts, that the vessels that are left over in the temple of Yahweh, and the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, must not go to Babylon.’ 19 For thus says Yahweh of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the stands, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city, 20 which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, did not take when he deported Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem. 21 For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Yahweh, and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem: 22 ‘They will be brought to Babylon, and there they will stay until the day of my attending to them,’ declares Yahweh. ‘Then I will bring them up and restore them to this place.’ ” 1 And it was in that same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah, the son of Azzur, the prophet who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of Yahweh before the eyes of the priests and all the people, saying, 2 “Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 3 Within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the house of Yahweh which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon took away from this place and brought to Babylon. 4 And Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, I will bring back to this place,’ declares Yahweh, ‘For I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ” 5 Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet before the eyes of the priests and before the eyes of all the people who were standing in the house of Yahweh, 6 and Jeremiah the prophet said, “Amen! May Yahweh do so; may Yahweh fulfill your words that you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the house of Yahweh and all the exiles from Babylon to this place. 7 Nevertheless listen please to this word that I am speaking in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people, 8 The prophets who were before me and before you from ancient times prophesied against many countries and against great kingdoms of war, and of disaster, and of plague. 9 The prophet who prophesies peace, at the coming of the word of the prophet, will become known as the prophet that Yahweh has truly sent.” 10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it. 11 Then Hananiah said before the eyes of all the people, saying, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘This is how I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, within two years, from the neck of all the nations.’ ” And Jeremiah the prophet went on his way. 12 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet broke the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 13 “Go, and you must say to Hananiah, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “You have broken yoke bars of wood, but you have made in place of them yoke bars of iron.” 14 For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, to serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and they will serve him, and I have even given the animals of the open field to him.” ’ ” 15 Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, “Please listen, Hananiah, Yahweh has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie. 16 Therefore thus says Yahweh, ‘Look, I am going to send you from the face of the earth. This year you will die because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.’ ” 17 And Hananiah the prophet died in that same year in the seventh month.

Jeremiah,"1 And these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remainder of the exiles, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had deported from Jerusalem to Babylon, 2 after the going out of Jeconiah the king, and the queen mother, and the court officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, and the artisans, and the smiths from Jerusalem, 3 by the hand of Elasah, the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah, the king of Judah, sent to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, to Babylon, saying, 4 “Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have deported from Jerusalem to Babylon, 5 ‘Build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit. 6 Take wives and father sons and daughters, and take for your sons wives, and give your daughters to men that they may bear sons and daughters, and multiply there, and you must not be few. 7 And seek the prosperity of the city where I have deported you, and pray on behalf of it to Yahweh, for in its prosperity you will have prosperity.’ 8 For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Do not let your prophets who are in your midst, and your diviners, deceive you, and you must not listen to your dreams that you are causing them to dream. 9 For they are prophesying falsely to you in my name; I have not sent them,’ declares Yahweh. 10 For thus says Yahweh, ‘As soon as the time has passed, seventy years for Babylon, I will attend to you, and I will fulfill my good word to you, to bring you back to this place. 11 For I know the plans that I am planning concerning you,’ declares Yahweh, ‘plans for prosperity and not for harm, to give to you a future and a hope. 12 Then when you call me, and you come and pray to me, then I will listen to you. 13 When you search for me, then you will find me, if you seek me with all your heart. 14 And I will let myself be found by you,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and I will restore your fortunes, and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places to which I have driven you,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and I will bring you back to the place from which I deported you.’ 15 Because you have said, ‘Yahweh has raised up prophets for us in Babylon’— 16 for thus says Yahweh concerning the king who sits on the throne of David and concerning all the people who live in this city, your fellow kinsmen who did not go with you into the exile— 17 thus says Yahweh of hosts, ‘Look, I am going to send among them the sword, the famine, and the plague, and I will make them like rotten figs that cannot be eaten because of their bad quality. 18 And I will pursue them with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague, and I will make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, and a horror, and an object of hissing, and a disgrace among all the nations to which I have driven them, 19 because they did not listen to my words,’ declares Yahweh, ‘when I sent to them my servants the prophets, sending over and over again, and they would not listen,’ declares Yahweh. 20 And you, hear the word of Yahweh, all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. 21 Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab, the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah, the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you in my name a lie, ‘Look, I am going to give them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and he will strike them before your eyes. 22 And a curse will be taken up because of them by all the exiles of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, “May Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,” 23 because they have done a disgraceful thing in Israel, and they have committed adultery with the wives of their neighbors, and they have spoken words in my name, lies that I have not commanded them, and I am he who knows, and I am a witness,’ declares Yahweh.” 24 And to Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall say, saying, 25 “Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Because you yourself sent a letter in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying, 26 “Yahweh made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, so that there are overseers in the house of Yahweh over any mad man who exhibits the behavior of a prophet, and you must put him into the stocks and into the neck iron, 27 and so then why have you not rebuked Jeremiah the Anathothite who exhibits the behavior of a prophet for you? 28 Because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, ‘It will be a long time, build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit.’ ” ’ ” 29 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet. 30 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying, 31 “Send to all the exiles, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: “Because Shemaiah prophesied to you, though I have not sent him, and he has made you trust in a lie,” 32 therefore thus says Yahweh, “Look, I am going to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his offspring. There will not be for him a man who lives in the midst of this people, and he will not see the good that I am going to do to my people,” declares Yahweh, “For he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh.” ’ ” 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, 2 “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Write for yourself all the words that I have spoken to you in a scroll. 3 For look, days are coming,’ declares Yahweh, ‘when I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel and Judah,’ says Yahweh, ‘and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their ancestors and they will take possession of it.’ ” 4 Now these are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah. 5 “For thus says Yahweh: ‘We have heard a sound of trembling, terror, and there is no peace. 6 Ask please and see whether a male can bear a child. Why do I see every strong man with his hands on his loins like a woman giving birth? And why are all their faces changed to paleness? 7 Alas! For that day is great, there is none like it. And it is a time of distress for Jacob, yet from it he will be delivered. 8 And it will happen on that day,’ declares Yahweh of hosts, ‘I will break his yoke from your neck and your bonds I will tear to pieces. And strangers will no longer let him work as a slave. 9 But they will serve Yahweh their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. 10 But you must not fear, my servant Jacob,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and you must not be dismayed, Israel, for look, I am going to save you from far, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. And Jacob will return, and he will be at rest, and he will be at ease, and there will be no one who makes him afraid. 11 For I am with you,’ declares Yahweh, ‘to save you. For I will make a complete destruction of all the nations to which I scattered you, but you I will not make a complete destruction. And I will chastise you to the measure, and I will not leave you entirely unpunished.’ 12 For thus says Yahweh, ‘Your injury is incurable, your wound is overcome by sickness. 13 There is no one who pleads your cause, for your boil there is no healing for you. 14 All your lovers have forgotten you, they do not care for you. I have struck you with the blow of an enemy, the punishment of the cruel, because of the greatness of your guilt, your sins are numerous. 15 Why do you cry because of your wound? Your pain is incurable. Because of the greatness of your guilt—your sins are vast— I have done these things to you. 16 Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured, and all your foes, all of them will go into captivity, and those who plunder you will be as plunder, and all those who plunder you I will make as plunder. 17 For I will present healing to you, and I will heal you of your wounds,’ declares Yahweh. ‘Because they have called you an outcast, saying, “It is Zion, there is no one who cares for her.” ’ 18 Thus says Yahweh: ‘Look, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob, and I will have compassion on his dwellings, and the city will be rebuilt upon its mound, and the citadel fortress will stand on its rightful site. 19 And thanksgiving and the sound of merrymakers will come out from them, and I will make them numerous, and they will not be few. And I will make them honored, and they will not be lowly. 20 And their children will be as of old, and their community will be established before me. And I will punish all their oppressors. 21 And their noble will be from them, and their ruler will come out from their midst. And I will bring him near and he will approach me. For who is he that would pledge his heart to approach me?’ declares Yahweh. 22 ‘And you will be to me a people, and I will be to you God.’ ” 23 Look, the storm of Yahweh! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest. It will whirl upon the head of the wicked. 24 The burning anger of Yahweh will not turn back until his doing, and until his accomplishing the plans of his mind. In the last of the days you will understand it. ",Jeremiah 29-30,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-29-30-62563/direct-download/tbd20090716.mp3
Jeremiah,"1 “At that time,” declares Yahweh, “I will be the God of all the clans of Israel, and they will be to me a people.” 2 Thus says Yahweh: “The people of the survivors of the sword found grace in the desert; Israel going to find their rest.” 3 From afar Yahweh appeared to me, saying, “I have loved you with an everlasting love. Therefore I have drawn you with loyal love. 4 I will again build you, and you will be built, O virgin Israel. You will again adorn yourself with your tambourines, and you will go forth in the dancing in a ring of the merrymakers. 5 You will again plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria. The planters will plant, and they will enjoy it. 6 For there will be a day when watchmen will call in the hill country of Ephraim, ‘Stand up, and let us go up to Zion, to Yahweh our God.’ ” 7 For thus says Yahweh, “Sing for joy for Jacob with gladness, and shout out for the head of the nations. Proclaim, praise, and say, ‘Save, O Yahweh, your people, the remnant of Israel.’ 8 Look, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, and I will gather them from the remotest part of the earth. Among them the blind, and the lame, those who are pregnant, and those who give birth, together, a great assembly, they will return here. 9 With weeping they will come, and with pleas for mercy I will bring them; I will let them walk by streams of water in a straight path. They will not stumble in it, for I have become to Israel a father, and Ephraim, he is my firstborn.” 10 Hear the word of Yahweh, O nations, and declare in the coastlands from afar, and say, “The scatterer of Israel will gather him, and he will keep him as a shepherd his flock. 11 For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob, and he has redeemed him from the hand of the person stronger than he. 12 And they will come, and they will sing for joy on the height of Zion, and they will be radiant over the goodness of Yahweh, over the grain, and over the wine, and over the olive oil, and over the young ones of the flock, and over the cattle. And their life will become like a well-watered garden, and they will never languish again.” 13 “Then the young woman will rejoice in the dancing in a ring, and the young men and the old men together. And I will turn their mourning to jubilation, and I will comfort them, and I will gladden them from their sorrow. 14 And I will saturate the appetite of the priests with fatness, and my people will be satisfied with my goodness,” declares Yahweh. 15 Thus says Yahweh, “A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, the weeping of bitterness. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted because of her children, for they are no more.” 16 Thus says Yahweh: “Restrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, for there is a reward for your work,” declares Yahweh, “and they will return from the land of the enemy. 17 And there is hope for your future,” declares Yahweh, “and your children will return to their territory. 18 Indeed I heard Ephraim pitying themselves, ‘You disciplined me, and I was disciplined, like a calf that is not trained. Bring me back and let me return, for you are Yahweh my God. 19 For after my turning back I repented, and after coming to understand I struck my thigh. I was ashamed and also humiliated, because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’ 20 Is Ephraim my dear son, or the child of my delight? For as often as I have earnestly spoken against him, I still remember him. Therefore my bowels are turbulent for him, surely I will have compassion on him,” declares Yahweh. 21 “Set up for yourself road markers, make for yourself signposts, set your mind to the main road, the road by which you went. Return, O virgin of Israel, return to these your cities. 22 How long will you waver, O unfaithful daughter? For Yahweh has created a new thing on the earth, a woman, she shelters a man.” 23 Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “They will again say these words in the land of Judah and in its towns at my restoring their fortunes, ‘Yahweh bless you, O settlement of righteousness, O hill of holiness.’ 24 And Judah and all of its towns together will live in it, farmers and those who travel with the flocks. 25 For I will saturate the thirst of the weary, and every person who languishes I will replenish.” 26 At this I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me. 27 “Look, the days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “and I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of humankind, and with the seed of animals. 28 And then as I have watched over them to pull up, and to tear down, and to annihilate, and to destroy, and to do evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” declares Yahweh. 29 “In those days they will say no longer, ‘Parents have eaten unripe fruit, and the teeth of the children are set on edge.’ 30 But each will die because of his iniquity, everyone who eats the unripe fruit, their teeth will be set on edge. 31 Look, the days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “and I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, 32 not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day of my grasping them by their hand, bringing them out from the land of Egypt, my covenant that they themselves broke, though I myself was a master over them,” declares Yahweh. 33 “But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” declares Yahweh: “I will put my law in their inward parts and on their hearts I will write it, and I will be to them God, and they themselves will be to me people. 34 And they will no longer teach each one his neighbor, or each one his brother, saying, ‘Know Yahweh,’ for all of them will know me, from their smallest and up to their greatest,” declares Yahweh, “for I will forgive their iniquity and their sin I will no longer remember.” 35 Thus says Yahweh, who gives the sun for light by day, the regulations of the moon and the stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea and its waves roar—Yahweh of hosts is his name. 36 “If these rules would cease from before me,” declares Yahweh, “also the offspring of Israel would cease from being a nation before me forever.” 37 Thus says Yahweh, “If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be explored, also I will reject all the offspring of Israel because of all that they have done,” declares Yahweh. 38 “Look, days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “and the city will be rebuilt for Yahweh, from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. 39 And the measuring line will still go out immediately in front of it to the hill of Gareb, and it will turn to Goah. 40 And the whole of the valley of the corpses, and the ashes, and all the cultivated fields up to the wadi of Kidron, up to the corner of the Gate of the Horses toward the east will be holy to Yahweh. It will not be uprooted, and it will not be overthrown again forever.” 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah the king of Judah, that was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. 2 Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was laying siege to Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah, 3 where Zedekiah, the king of Judah, had confined him, saying, “Why are you prophesying, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Look, I am going to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it, 4 and Zedekiah, the king of Judah, will not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but surely he will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will speak face to face with him and he will see him eye to eye, 5 and to Babylon he will bring Zedekiah, and there he will be until my attending to him,” declares Yahweh. “If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not be successful” ’?” 6 And Jeremiah said, “The word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 7 ‘Look, Hanamel, the son of Shallum, your uncle, is going to come to you, saying, “Buy for yourself my field that is at Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy it.” ’ 8 Then Hanamel, the son of my uncle, came to me, to the courtyard of the guard according to the word of Yahweh, and he said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is at Anathoth, that is in the land of Benjamin, for to you is the claim of possession, and to you the redemption; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of Yahweh. 9 And I bought the field from Hanamel, the son of my uncle, that was at Anathoth. And I weighed out to him the money, seventeen silver shekels. 10 And I signed on the letter and sealed it, and I called witnesses as witness, and I weighed out the money on a set of scales. 11 Then I took the deed of the purchase, the sealed copy containing the commandments and the rules, together with the one that was open. 12 And I gave the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel, the son of my uncle, and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of the purchase, in the presence of the Judeans who were sitting in the courtyard of the guard. 13 And I commanded Baruch in their presence, saying, 14 ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase, the sealed one, and this opened deed, and you must put them in an earthenware jar so that they may be kept preserved many days.” 15 For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.” ’ 16 And I prayed to Yahweh—after giving my deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah—saying, 17 ‘Ah Lord Yahweh! Look, you made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for you, 18 showing loyal love to the thousands, and repaying the guilt of parents into the laps of their children after them. Powerful, great, mighty, his name is Yahweh of hosts, 19 great in counsel and great in deed, whose eyes are opened to all the ways of the children of humankind, to give to each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds, 20 who accomplished signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, up to this day, and in Israel, and among humankind, and you have made for yourself a name, as it is this day. 21 And you brought out your people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an arm stretched out, and with great terror. 22 And you gave to them this land, which you swore to their ancestors to give to them, a land flowing with milk and honey. 23 And they entered and took possession of it, but they did not listen to your voice, and they did not follow your law. They did nothing of all that you commanded to them to do, and you caused to happen to them all this disaster. 24 Look, the siege ramps have come up to the city to capture it, and the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the plague, and what you spoke happened, and look, you are seeing it. 25 Yet you have said to me, Lord Yahweh, “Buy for yourself the field with the money, and call witnesses as witness,” though the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ ” 26 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying, 27 “Look, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for me?” 28 Therefore thus says Yahweh: “Look, I am going to give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and he will capture it. 29 And the Chaldeans, who are fighting against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and they will burn it, and the houses where they have made smoke offerings on their roofs to Baal, and where they have devoted libations to other gods, in order to provoke me to anger. 30 For the people of Israel and the people of Judah were doing only evil in my eyes from their youth, for the people of Israel were only provoking me to anger by the work of their hands,” declares Yahweh. 31 “For this city has been for me a cause of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even until this day, so I will remove it from my sight, 32 because of all the evil of the people of Israel and the people of Judah that they did to provoke me to anger—they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 33 And they have turned to me their backs and not their faces, though I have taught them over and over again, but they were not listening to accept discipline. 34 And they set up their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it. 35 And they built the high places of Baal that are in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to present as offerings their sons and their daughters to Molech, which I had not commanded them, and it had not come to my mind to do this detestable thing in order to cause Judah to sin.” 36 “So now therefore, thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning this city, of which you are saying, ‘It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague’: 37 Look, I am going to gather them from all the lands to which I driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath, and I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell in safety. 38 And they will be for me a people, and I will be for them God. 39 And I will give to them one heart and one way, to revere me forever, for good to them, and to their children after them. 40 And I will make with them an everlasting covenant that I will not turn away from them, my doing good to them, and my reverence I will put in their hearts so that they will not turn aside from me. 41 And I will rejoice over them to do good to them, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness with all my heart, and with all my inner self.” 42 “For thus says Yahweh, ‘Just as I have brought to this people all this great disaster, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise to them. 43 And the fields will be bought in this land of which you are saying, “It is a desolation, without humankind or animals. It has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.” 44 They will buy fields with money, and they will sign the deeds, and they will seal them, and they will call witnesses as witness in the land of Benjamin, and in the surroundings of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negev, for I will restore their fortunes,’ declares Yahweh.” ",Jeremiah 31-32,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-31-32-62564/direct-download/tbd20090717.mp3
Jeremiah,"1 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah a second time while he was still held back in the courtyard of the guard, saying, 2 “Thus says Yahweh who made the earth, Yahweh who formed it to establish it, Yahweh is his name: 3 ‘Call to me, and I will answer you, and I will tell you great things and inaccessible things that you have not known.’ 4 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, that were torn down to make a defense against the siege ramps and against the sword: 5 ‘They are coming to fight against the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the corpses of the people whom I will strike in my anger and in my wrath, for whom I have hidden my face from this city because of all their wickedness. 6 Look, I am going to bring healing and health to it, and I will heal them, and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and reliability. 7 And I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and I will rebuild them as in the beginning. 8 And I will cleanse them from all their guilt that they sinned against me, and I will forgive all their iniquities that they sinned against me, and that they rebelled against me. 9 And it will be to me a name of jubilation, a praise, and a glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear all the good that I will do for them, and they will fear, and they will tremble because of all the good, and because of all the prosperity that I will provide for it.’ 10 “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Again will be heard in this place, of which you are saying, “It is a waste, without people and without animals,” in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without people and without inhabitants and without animals, 11 the voice of jubilation, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who say, “Praise Yahweh of hosts, for Yahweh is good, for his loyal love is forever,” the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of Yahweh, for I will restore the fortunes of the land as in the beginning,’ says Yahweh. 12 Thus says Yahweh of hosts: ‘Again there will be in this waste place, without people and animals, and in all its towns, pasture for shepherds allowing their flock to lie down. 13 In the towns of the hill country, in the towns of the Shephelah, and in the towns of the Negev, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the surroundings of Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hands of the counter,’ says Yahweh. 14 ‘Look, days are coming,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and I will fulfill the good promise that I promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah. 15 In those days and in that time I will make a branch of righteousness sprout for David, and he will execute justice and righteousness in the land. 16 In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell safely, and this is what they shall call it: “Yahweh is our righteousness.” ’ 17 For thus says Yahweh: ‘A man who sits on the throne of the house of Israel will not be cut off for David. 18 And for the priests, a man from the Levites who offers burnt offerings and who burns grain offerings and who brings sacrifices will not be cut off before me forever.’ ” 19 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying, 20 “Thus says Yahweh: ‘If you could break my covenant with the day, and my covenant with the night, so that day and night would not come at their time, 21 then my covenant could be broken with David my servant, from having a son who could rule on his throne, and with the Levites, the priests, my ministers. 22 As the host of heaven cannot be counted, and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will make numerous the offspring of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’ ” 23 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying, 24 “Have you not seen how these people speak, saying, ‘The two clans whom Yahweh chose, he has also rejected them’? Thus they spurn my people from being a nation before them any longer. 25 Thus says Yahweh: ‘If my covenant with day and with night, the regulations of heaven and earth, I had not established, 26 then the offspring of Jacob and David my servant I would reject, from choosing rulers from his offspring over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will restore their fortunes and I will have compassion on them.’ ” 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and all his army, with all the kingdoms of the earth under the dominion of his hand, and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying, 2 “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Go and say to Zedekiah the king of Judah, now you must say to him, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Look, I am going to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire. 3 And you will not escape from his hand, but surely you will be captured, and into his hand you will be given, and you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and you will speak face to face with him, and to Babylon you will go.’ 4 However, hear the word of Yahweh, O Zedekiah, the king of Judah. Thus says Yahweh concerning you: ‘You will not die by the sword. 5 In peace you will die, and as there was burning for your ancestors, the former kings who were before you, so they will burn for you, and they will lament for you, “Alas, lord!” For the word I have spoken,’ declares Yahweh.” ’ ” 6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Zedekiah the king of Judah all these words in Jerusalem 7 when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left over—Lachish and Azekah, for these remained among the cities of Judah, the cities of fortification. 8 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after king Zedekiah made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem to proclaim release to them, 9 to let go each one his male slave and each one his female slave, the Hebrew and the free Hebrew, so that no one among the Judeans should enslave his fellow countryman. 10 And all the officials and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant to let go each one his male slave and each one his female slave, not enslaving them again, and they obeyed and they let them go. 11 But afterward they turned back and they brought back the male slaves and the female slaves whom they had let go free, and they subdued them as male slaves and female slaves. 12 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, 13 “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘I made a covenant with your ancestors on the day of my bringing them out from the land of Egypt, from the house of slaves, saying, 14 “At the end of seven years you must let go each one his fellow countryman, the Hebrew who has been sold to you and who has served you six years, and you must let him go free from you.” But your ancestors did not listen to me, and they did not incline their ears. 15 And you turned back recently and you did right in my eyes, to proclaim release each one to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name. 16 But you turned back and you profaned my name when you brought back each one his male slave and each one his female slave, whom you had let go free according to their desire, and you subdued them to be to you as male slaves and as female slaves.’ 17 “Therefore thus says Yahweh, ‘You have not listened to me to proclaim release each one to his fellow countryman and each one to his neighbor. Look, I am going to proclaim to you a release,’ declares Yahweh, ‘to the sword, to the plague, and to the famine, and I will make you a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth. 18 And I will make the men who transgressed my covenant, who have not kept the words of the covenant that they made before me, like the calf which they cut in two and they passed between its parts— 19 the officials of Judah, and the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf— 20 and I will give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of the seekers of their lives, and their dead bodies will become as food for the birds of the heavens and for the animals of the earth. 21 And Zedekiah the king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of the seekers of their lives, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, who retreated from you. 22 Look, I am going to command,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and I will bring them back to this city, and they will fight against it, and they will capture it, and they will burn it with fire, and the towns of Judah I will make a desolation without an inhabitant.’ ” 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying, 2 “Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to the house of Yahweh into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.” 3 So I took Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole of the house of the Rechabites, 4 and I brought them to the house of Yahweh, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was beside the chamber of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah, the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold. 5 Then I set before the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine and cups, and I said to them, “Drink wine.” 6 But they answered, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our ancestor, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall not drink wine, you or your children, forever. 7 And you shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed, and you shall not plant a vineyard, and it shall not be for you, but in tents you shall live all your days, so that you may live many days on the surface of the land where you are dwelling as aliens.’ 8 And we obeyed the voice of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our ancestor, in all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, 9 and not to build houses for our living, and there is not vineyard, or field, or seed for us. 10 But we have lived in tents, and we have obeyed, and we have done all that Jehonadab, our ancestor, commanded us. 11 But then at the coming up against the land of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, then we said, ‘Come and let us go to Jerusalem before the army of the Chaldeans, and before the army of the Arameans.’ That is why we are living in Jerusalem.” 12 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying, 13 “Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Go and say to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Can you not learn a lesson to listen to my words?” declares Yahweh. 14 “The words of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, that he commanded his descendants to not drink, have been carried out, and they have not drunk until this day, for they have obeyed the command of their ancestor. But I have spoken to you over and over again, and you have not listened to me. 15 And I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, I have sent them over and over again, saying, ‘Turn back please each one from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and you must not go after other gods to serve them, so that you may live on the land that I gave to you and to your ancestors.’ But you did not incline your ear and you did not listen to me. 16 For the descendants of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, have carried out the command of their ancestor that he commanded them, but this people did not listen to me.” 17 Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, “Look, I am going to bring to Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem every disaster that I have spoken against them, because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, and I have called to them and they have not answered.” ’ ” 18 But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, “Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Because you have listened to the command of Jonadab your ancestor, and you have kept all his commands, and you have done all that he commanded you,’ 19 therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘A man will not be cut off for Jonadab, the son of Rechab, to stand before me always.’ ” 1 And then in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, 2 “Take for yourself a scroll and you must write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day that I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, and until this day. 3 Perhaps when the house of Judah hears all the disasters that I am planning to do to them, then they may turn back each one from his evil way, and I will forgive their guilt and their sin.” 4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Yahweh that he had spoken to him on a scroll. 5 And Jeremiah instructed Baruch, saying, “I am held back, I am not able to enter the temple of Yahweh. 6 So you must go and you shall read aloud from the scroll that you have written from my mouth the words of Yahweh in the hearing of the people in the temple of Yahweh on a day of fast, and also you shall read aloud in the hearing of all those of Judah who came from their towns. 7 Perhaps their plea will fall before Yahweh and each one will turn away from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that Yahweh pronounced against this people.” 8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet instructed him, to read aloud from the scroll the words of Yahweh in the temple of Yahweh. 9 And then in the fifth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the towns of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before Yahweh. 10 Then Baruch read aloud from the scroll the words of Jeremiah in the temple of Yahweh, in the chamber of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, the secretary, in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple of Yahweh in the hearing of all the people. 11 When Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of Yahweh from the scroll, 12 he went down to the house of the king, to the chamber of the secretary, and look, all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, and Delaiah, the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah, the son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. 13 And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard at the reading aloud of Baruch from the scroll in the hearing of the people. 14 Then all the officials sent Jehudi, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “The scroll that you read aloud from in the hearing of the people, take it in your hand and come.” And Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and he came to them. 15 And they said to him, “Sit please and read it aloud in our hearing.” So Baruch read aloud in their hearing. 16 And then, the moment of their hearing all the words, they turned to one another in alarm and they said to Baruch, “We must certainly report all these words to the king!” 17 Then they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us please, how did you write all these words, from his mouth?” 18 And Baruch said to them, “From his mouth. He dictated to me all these words and I was writing on the scroll with the ink.” 19 Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah, and let not a man know where you are.” 20 And they went to the king, to the courtyard, and they put the scroll for safe-keeping in the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they reported all the words in the hearing of the king. 21 Then the king sent Jehudi to take the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and Jehudi read it aloud in the hearing of the king, and in the hearing of all the officials who stood next to the king. 22 Now the king was sitting in the quarters of the winter in the ninth month, and a fire-pot was burning before him. 23 And then, as Jehudi read three or four columns, he would cut it up in pieces with the knife of the scribe, and he would throw it into the fire that was in the fire-pot until the whole of the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire-pot. 24 And the king and any of his servants who heard all these words were not startled, and they did not tear their garments. 25 And even when Elnathan, and Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. 26 And the king commanded Jerahmeel, the son of the king, and Seraiah, the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but Yahweh hid them. 27 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after the king burned the scroll and the words that Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, 28 “Take again for yourself another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll which Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, has burned. 29 And concerning Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, you shall say, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “You have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written in it, saying, “The king of Babylon will certainly come and he will destroy this land, and he will cause to disappear from it humankind and animals”?’ ” 30 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, “There will not be for him one who sits on the throne of David. And his dead body will be thrown out to the heat in the day and to the frost in the night. 31 And I will punish him, and his offspring, and his servants for their guilt, and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the people of Judah all the disaster with which I have threatened them, but they would not listen.” ’ ” 32 Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah, the secretary, and he wrote on it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, had burned in the fire, and furthermore was added to them many words like these.

Jeremiah,"1 And king Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had made king, reigned as king in the land of Judah in place of Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim. 2 But he and his servants and the people of the land did not listen to the words of Yahweh that he spoke by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet. 3 And king Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please pray for us to Yahweh our God.” 4 Now Jeremiah was coming and going out in the midst of the people and they had not put him in the house of imprisonment. 5 And the army of Pharaoh had come out from Egypt, and the Chaldeans, who were laying siege to Jerusalem, heard their report and they withdrew from Jerusalem. 6 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 7 “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘This is what you shall say to the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me, “Look, the army of Pharaoh, which set out to help you, is going to return to his land Egypt. 8 And the Chaldeans will return, and they will fight against this city, and they will capture it, and they will burn it with fire.” ’ 9 Thus says Yahweh: ‘You must not deceive yourselves, saying, “Surely the Chaldeans will go from us,” for they will not go. 10 For even if you struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and only men pierced through remained among them, each one in his tent, they would rise up and they would burn this city with fire.’ ” 11 And then, at the withdrawing of the army of the Chaldeans from Jerusalem before the army of Pharaoh, 12 Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive a portion from there in the midst of the people. 13 And when he was at the Gate of Benjamin, there was a sentry on duty whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans!” 14 And Jeremiah said, “That is a lie! I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But he would not listen to him. So Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. 15 And the officials were angry at Jeremiah and they struck him. And they put him in prison, in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for they had converted it to the prison. 16 So Jeremiah came to the dungeon, even to the vaulted cells, and Jeremiah stayed there many days. 17 Then King Zedekiah sent and fetched him. And the king questioned him in secrecy in his house, and he said, “Is there a word from Yahweh?” And Jeremiah said, “There is.” And he said, “You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon.” 18 Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What did I do wrong to you, or to your servants, or to this people, that you have put me in prison? 19 And where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land’? 20 Now hear please, my lord the king, please let my plea fall before you. You must not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, so that I will not die there.” 21 So King Zedekiah commanded, and they handed Jeremiah over in the courtyard of the guard, and they gave to him a round loaf of bread from the street of the bakers every day until the finishing of all the bread from the city. And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard. 1 Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people, saying, 2 “Thus says Yahweh, ‘The one who stays in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague. But the one who goes out to the Chaldeans will live. And his life will be for him as booty, and he will live.’ 3 Thus says Yahweh, ‘Surely this city will be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.’ ” 4 Then the officials said to the king, “Please, this man must be killed, because he is making slack the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking to them words like these, for this man is not seeking for welfare to this people, but only for harm.” 5 And Zedekiah the king said, “Look, he is in your hand, for the king is not able to do a thing against you.” 6 So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the pit of Malchiah, the son of the king, which was in the courtyard of the guard. And they let Jeremiah down by ropes. Now in the pit there was no water, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud. 7 When Ebed-melech the Cushite, a eunuch who was in the house of the king, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the pit—now the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin— 8 Ebed-melech went out from the house of the king and spoke to the king, saying, 9 “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, in that they have thrown him into the pit, and he will die there because of starvation, for there is no longer any bread in the city.” 10 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, “Take with you these thirty men and pull Jeremiah the prophet up from the pit before he dies.” 11 So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the palace of the king, to a place beneath the storehouse, and he took from there rags and worn-out clothes. And he let them down into the pit by ropes to Jeremiah. 12 Then Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Please put the rags and worn-out clothes under the joints of your arms under the ropes,” and Jeremiah did so. 13 And they pulled Jeremiah by the ropes and brought him up from the pit. And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard. 14 And Zedekiah the king sent and made someone bring Jeremiah the prophet to him, to the third entrance that was at the temple of Yahweh. And the king said to Jeremiah, “I am asking you something, you must not hide anything from me.” 15 And Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not surely kill me? Besides, if I advise you, you will not listen to me. 16 So Zedekiah the king swore to Jeremiah in secret, saying, “As Yahweh lives, who has made for us this life, I will not kill you and I will not give you into the hand of these men who are seeking your life.” 17 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘If only you will go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then you will live, and this city will not be burned with fire, and you will live, you and your house. 18 But if you do not go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape from their hand.’ ” 19 And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest they give me into their hand and they abuse me.” 20 And Jeremiah said, “They will not give you over. Please obey the voice of Yahweh with regard to what I am saying to you, and it will go well with you, and you will live. 21 But if you are refusing to surrender, this is the thing that Yahweh has shown me. 22 Now look, all the women who remain in the house of the king of Judah are being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon. And look, they are saying, ‘Your trusted friends have misled you, and they have prevailed against you. Your feet are stuck in the mud, so they turned backward.’ 23 And all your wives and your children will be led out to the Chaldeans, and you will not escape from their hand, but by the hand of the king of Babylon you will be seized, and this city will burn with fire.” 24 And Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “No man must know about these words so that you will not die. 25 And if the officials hear that I have spoken with you, and they come to you and say to you, ‘Please tell us what you said to the king. You must not conceal it from us so that we will not kill you. And what did the king say to you?’ 26 Then you shall say to them, ‘I was presenting my plea before the king, to not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan to die there.’ ” 27 And all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, and he informed them like all these words that the king commanded. So they fell silent, for the conversation was not heard. 28 And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was captured. And it happened that Jerusalem was captured. 1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and laid siege to it. 2 In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was taken by assault. 3 And all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim the chief officer, Nergal-sharezer the high official, with all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon. 4 And then when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the soldiers with him, they fled and went out at night from the city by the way of the garden of the king through the gate between the walls. And they went out toward the Jordan Valley. 5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And they took him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath. And he pronounced sentence on him. 6 And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. 7 Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah and tied him up with bronze fetters to bring him to Babylon. 8 And the Chaldeans burned the palace of the king and the houses of the people with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 9 Then the rest of the people who were left in the city, and those deserting who had deserted to him, and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, deported to Babylon. 10 And some of the poor people, who had nothing, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah. And he gave them vineyards and fields on that day. 11 And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon commanded concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying, 12 “Take him and set your eyes on him. And you must not do something bad to him, but only that which he speaks to you, so do with him.” 13 So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, sent word, along with Nebushazban the chief officer, and Nergal-sharezer the high official, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon. 14 And they sent and took Jeremiah from the courtyard of the guard and gave him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him to the house, so he stayed in the midst of the people. 15 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah at his confinement in the courtyard of the guard, saying, 16 “Go and say to Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Look, I am about to bring my words to pass against this city for evil and not for good. And they will be before you on that day. 17 But I will rescue you on that day,” declares Yahweh, “and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are frightened. 18 For surely I will save you, and you will not fall by the sword. But your life will be for you as booty because you have trusted in me,” declares Yahweh.’ ” ",Jeremiah 37-39,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-37-39-62566/direct-download/tbd20090721.mp3
Jeremiah,"7 Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah and tied him up with bronze fetters to bring him to Babylon. 8 And the Chaldeans burned the palace of the king and the houses of the people with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 9 Then the rest of the people who were left in the city, and those deserting who had deserted to him, and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, deported to Babylon. 10 And some of the poor people, who had nothing, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah. And he gave them vineyards and fields on that day. 11 And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon commanded concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying, 12 “Take him and set your eyes on him. And you must not do something bad to him, but only that which he speaks to you, so do with him.” 13 So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, sent word, along with Nebushazban the chief officer, and Nergal-sharezer the high official, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon. 14 And they sent and took Jeremiah from the courtyard of the guard and gave him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him to the house, so he stayed in the midst of the people. 15 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah at his confinement in the courtyard of the guard, saying, 16 “Go and say to Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Look, I am about to bring my words to pass against this city for evil and not for good. And they will be before you on that day. 17 But I will rescue you on that day,” declares Yahweh, “and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are frightened. 18 For surely I will save you, and you will not fall by the sword. But your life will be for you as booty because you have trusted in me,” declares Yahweh.’ ” 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had let him go from Ramah, where he had been taken bound in chains in the midst of all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah who were being deported to Babylon. 2 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “Yahweh your God threatened this disaster to this place, 3 and now he has brought it about, and Yahweh has done just as he threatened. Because you sinned against Yahweh and did not listen to his voice, so this thing has happened to you. 4 And so then look, I have released you today from the chains that were on your hands. If it is good in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, then come, and I will take care of you. But if it is bad in your eyes to come with me to Babylon, then refrain. Look, the whole land is before you. To wherever it is good and right in your eyes to go, then go there.” 5 While he still had not turned back, Nebuzaradan added, “Return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed in an official position over the towns of Judah, and stay with him in the midst of the people. Or to wherever it is right in your eyes to go, then go there.” Then the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of provisions and a present, and let him go. 6 So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah and stayed with him in the midst of the people who were left in the land. 7 When all the commanders of the armies who were in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam in an official position in the land, and that he had put him in charge of men, and women, and little children, and of the poor of the land, of all those who had not been deported to Babylon, 8 then they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan, and Jehonathan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. 9 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, “You must not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you. 10 As for me, look, I am staying at Mizpah to represent you before the Chaldeans who come to us. But you, gather wine and summer fruit and oil, and put them in your vessels, and live in your towns that you have seized.” 11 And also all the Judeans who were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and who were in all the lands, when they heard that the king of Babylon had given a remnant to Judah and that he had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, in an official position over them, 12 then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they were scattered. And they came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and they gathered wine and summer fruit that yielded in great abundance. 13 And Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who were in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 14 and said to him, “Are you at all aware that Baalis, the king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, to kill you?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them. 15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah said to Gedaliah in secrecy at Mizpah, saying, “Please let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and nobody will know. Why should he kill you, so that all of Judah who are gathered to you will be scattered, and the remnant of Judah will perish?” 16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You must not do this thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael.” 1 And then in the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, from the offspring of the kingship, and one of the chief officers of the king, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah, along with ten men. And they ate bread together there at Mizpah. 2 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah got up, along with the ten men who were with him, and they struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and killed him whom the king of Babylon had appointed in an official position over the land. 3 Then Ishmael killed all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, along with the Chaldeans who were found there, the soldiers. 4 And then on the second day of the killing of Gedaliah—and no one knew— 5 then men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty men with shaven beards and torn garments, who had cut themselves with blades, having grain offerings and frankincense in their hands to bring to the temple of Yahweh. 6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out to meet them from Mizpah, weeping as he came. And then as he was meeting them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam.” 7 And then, the moment of their coming to the middle of the city, then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, along with the men who were with him, slaughtered them and threw them to the middle of the pit. 8 But ten men were found among them, and they said to Ishmael, “You must not kill us, for we have hidden treasures in the field, wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey. So he refrained and he did not kill them in the midst of their fellow countrymen. 9 Now the pit into which Ishmael threw all the corpses of the men whom he had killed along with Gedaliah was the same one that King Asa had made because of Baasha the king of Israel, who was against him. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain ones. 10 Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the daughters of the king and all the people who were left at Mizpah, over whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites. 11 When Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who were with him, heard all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, 12 then they took all the men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. And they met him at the great pool that is in Gibeon. 13 And then, the moment that all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who were with him, they were glad. 14 So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and returned and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. 15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped with eight men from Johanan, and they went to the Ammonites. 16 Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who were with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, strong men, soldiers, and women, and little children, and eunuchs whom he brought back from Gibeon. 17 And they set out and stayed at the lodging place of Chimham that is near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt 18 because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed in an official position over the land. 1 Then all the commanders of the armies, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the smallest to the greatest, approached 2 and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “May our plea please fall before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your God, for all this remnant, for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes are seeing us. 3 And let Yahweh your God inform us the way in which we should go and the thing that we should do.” 4 And Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard. Look, I am going to pray to Yahweh your God according to your words, and then all the words that Yahweh answers you I will tell you; I will not withhold from you a word.” 5 Then they said to Jeremiah, “May Yahweh be against us as a true and faithful witness if we do not do according to all the words that Yahweh your God sends you for us. 6 Whether good or bad, we will listen to the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of Yahweh our God.” 7 And then at the end of ten days the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah. 8 And he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the armies who were with him, and all the people from the smallest to the greatest, 9 and said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to cause your plea to fall before him: 10 ‘If only you will stay in this land, then I will build you and I will not tear you down, and I will plant you and I will not pluck you up, for I relent of the disaster that I have brought to you. 11 You must not be afraid of the king of Babylon whom you are afraid of. You must not be afraid of him,’ declares Yahweh, ‘for I am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand. 12 And I will show you compassion, and he will have compassion on you and will restore you to your soil. 13 But if you are saying, “We will not stay in this land,” so as to not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, 14 saying, “No, for we will go to the land of Egypt where we will not see war, and we will not hear the sound of a horn, and we will not be hungry for bread, and there we will stay,” 15 then therefore hear the word of Yahweh, O remnant of Judah. Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “If you are determined to go to Egypt, and you go to dwell as aliens there, 16 then it will be that the sword that you are in fear of will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine that you are anxious of will pursue after you there into Egypt, and there you will die. 17 So all the people who are determined to go to Egypt to dwell as aliens there will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague, and there will not be for them an escapee or a survivor from the disaster that I am bringing upon them.” 18 For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will pour out on you at your going to Egypt, and you will become a curse, and a horror, and a curse formula, and a disgrace, and you will no longer see this place.” ’ 19 Yahweh has spoken to you, O remnant of Judah, ‘You must not go to Egypt.’ You must certainly know that I have warned you today 20 that you have made a fatal mistake, for you sent me to Yahweh your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to Yahweh our God, and all that Yahweh our God says, so tell us and we will do it.’ 21 So I have told you today, and you have not listened to the voice of Yahweh your God, or of anything that he sent me for you. 22 Now then, certainly you must know that by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague you will die in the place where you desire to go, to dwell as aliens there.” 1 And then, when Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, for which Yahweh their God had sent him to them with all these words, 2 Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the insolent men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie! Yahweh our God did not send you, saying, ‘You must not go to Egypt to dwell as aliens there.’ 3 But Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us in order to give us into the hand of the Chaldeans, to kill us and to deport us to Babylon.” 4 So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies, and all the people did not listen to the voice of Yahweh to stay in the land of Judah. 5 But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies took all the remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations to which they had been scattered to dwell as aliens in the land of Judah— 6 the men, and the women, and the little children, and the daughters of the king, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah— 7 and they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh. And they came up to Tahpanhes. 8 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, 9 “Take in your hands large stones and bury them in the mortar in the clay floor that is at the entrance of the palace of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes before the eyes of the people of the Judeans, 10 and say to them, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Look, I am going to send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden. And he will spread out his canopy over them. 11 And he will come and ravage the land of Egypt, and deliver those who are appointed for the plague, to the plague, and those who are appointed for the captivity, to the captivity, and those who are appointed for the sword, to the sword. 12 Then he will kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them and take them captive. And he will wrap up the land of Egypt just as the shepherd wraps up his cloak. And he will go forth from there in peace. 13 And he will break the stone pillars of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt. And he will burn the temples of the gods of Egypt with fire.” ’ ” 1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who were living in the land of Egypt, who were living at Migdol, and Tahpanhes, and Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, saying, 2 “Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen all the disaster that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the towns of Judah. And look, they are a site of ruins this day, and there is not in them an inhabitant, 3 because of their wickedness that they committed to provoke me to anger by going to make smoke offerings, serving other gods whom they had not known, neither they, you, or your ancestors. 4 And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending over and over again, saying, “Please, you must not do this detestable thing that I hate.” 5 But they did not listen and they did not incline their ears to turn back from their wickedness, to not make smoke offerings to other gods. 6 So my wrath and my anger were poured out and burned in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became as a site of ruins, as a desolation, as they are this day.’ 7 So then, thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Why are you doing great harm to yourselves, to cut off for yourselves man and woman, child and suckling, from the midst of Judah, to not leave over for yourselves a remnant, 8 provoking me to anger with the works of your hands, to make smoke offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to dwell as aliens, so as to cut off yourselves, and so that you are becoming as a curse, and as a disgrace among all the nations of the earth? 9 Have you forgotten the wicked things of your ancestors, and the wicked things of the kings of Judah, and the wicked things of their wives, and your wicked things, and the wicked things of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 10 They have not shown contrition up to this day, and they have not shown reverence, and they have not walked in my law and in my statutes that I set before you and before your ancestors.’ 11 Therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Look, I am determined to bring disaster on you, even to exterminate all Judah.12 And I will take away the remnant of Judah who are determined to come to the land of Egypt to dwell as aliens there, and everyone will perish. They will fall in the land of Egypt by the sword; they will perish by the famine, from the smallest to the greatest. By the sword and by the famine they will die and become as a curse, as a horror, and as a curse, and as a disgrace. 13 So I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt just as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague. 14 And there will not be a survivor or an escapee of the remnant of Judah, those who have come to dwell as an alien there in the land of Egypt, to return to the land of Judah where they are longing to return to dwell there, for they will not turn back, but only some survivors.’ ” 15 Then all the men who knew that their wives were making smoke offerings to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, and all the people who lived in the land of Egypt in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, 16 “Concerning the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yahweh, we are not going to listen to you! 17 But certainly we will do everything that went out from our mouths, to make smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and to pour out to her libations just as we did, we, and our ancestors, our kings, and our officials, in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, for then we had enough to eat, and we were well-off, and we did not see disaster. 18 But since we stopped making smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything, and by the sword and by the famine we have perished. 19 And indeed, when we were making smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out to her libations, was it not with the consent of our husbands that we made for her sacrificial cakes marked with her image, and we poured out to her libations?” 20 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and to the women, and to all the people who answered him a word, saying, 21 “The smoke offerings that you made in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—you and your ancestors, your kings and your officials, and the people of the land—did not Yahweh remember them, and did it not come to his mind? 22 And Yahweh was no longer able to bear it, because of the evil of your deeds, because of the detestable things that you committed. Thus your land became as a site of ruins, and as a horror, and as a curse, without inhabitants, as it is this day. 23 Because of the fact that you made smoke offerings, and that you sinned against Yahweh, and you did not listen to the voice of Yahweh, and you have not walked in his law, and in his statute, and in his legal provisions, therefore this disaster has happened to you, as it is this day.” 24 Then Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, “Hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt. 25 Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, ‘You and your wives have promised with your mouths and with your hands you have fulfilled, saying, “We certainly will carry out our vows that we vowed, to make smoke offerings to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out to her libations.” You must certainly keep your vows and you must certainly carry out your vows.’ 26 Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah, those who live in the land of Egypt: ‘Look, I hereby swear by my great name,’ says Yahweh, ‘surely my name will no longer be called in the mouth of any man of Judah, saying, “as the Lord Yahweh lives,” in all the land of Egypt. 27 Look, I am going to watch over them for harm and not for good, and all people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will perish by the sword and by the famine until their perishing. 28 And the survivors of the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number. And all the remnant of Judah who have come to the land of Egypt to dwell as aliens there will know whose word will endure, from me or from them. 29 And this will be to you the sign,’ declares Yahweh, ‘that I am going to punish you in this place, so that you may know that surely my words will endure against you for evil.’ 30 Thus says Yahweh: ‘Look, I am going to give Pharaoh Hophra, the king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave Zedekiah the king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, his enemy and the one who sought his life.’ ” ",Jeremiah 39:7-44:30,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-397-4430-62567/direct-download/tbd20090722.mp3
Jeremiah,"1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch, the son of Neriah, at his writing these words on a scroll from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying, 2 “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch: 3 ‘You said, “Woe please to me, for Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain. I am weary in my groaning and I do not find rest.” ’ 4 Thus you will say to him: ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Look, what I have built I am about to tear down, and what I have planted I am about to pluck up, it is all the land. 5 And you, do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek great things, for look, I am about to bring disaster upon all flesh,” declares Yahweh, “but to you I will give your life as booty in all the places where you may go.” ’ ” 1 The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations. 2 Concerning Egypt: Concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco, the king of Egypt, which was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah. 3 “Prepare small shield and shield, and approach for the battle! 4 Harness the horses and mount the steeds! And take your stand with helmets! Polish the spears! Put on the body armor! 5 Why do I see them terrified? They are turning back and their warriors are beaten down. And they have fled to a place of refuge and they do not turn back. Terror is from all around,” declares Yahweh. 6 The swift cannot flee, and the warrior cannot escape. In the north by the bank of the Euphrates River, they have stumbled and they have fallen. 7 Who is this that rises like the Nile, like the rivers whose waters surge? 8 Egypt rises like the Nile, even like the rivers whose waters surge. And he says, “Let me rise, let me cover the earth, let me destroy cities, and the inhabitants in them.” 9 Go up, O horses, and drive madly, O chariots, and let the warriors go forth; Cush and Put, who wield the small shield, and Lud, who wield and bend the bow. 10 For that day is to the Lord Yahweh of hosts a day of retribution, to take revenge on his foes. And the sword will devour and be satisfied, and it will drink its fill of their blood, for a sacrifice is for the Lord Yahweh of hosts in the land of the north by the Euphrates River. 11 Go up to Gilead and take balm, O virgin of the daughter of Egypt. In vain you make use of many medicines; there is no healing for you. 12 The nations have heard your shame, and your cry of lament fills the earth. For warrior has stumbled against warrior, together they have fallen, the two of them. 13 The word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon to attack the land of Egypt: 14 “Declare in Egypt, and proclaim in Migdol, and proclaim in Memphis and in Tahpanhes, say, ‘Take your stand and be prepared, for the sword will devour those all around you.’ 15 Why are your bulls defeated? He did not stand because Yahweh thrust him down. 16 He multiplied the ones stumbling. Furthermore, each one fell to his neighbor, and said, ‘Stand up, and let us return to our people and to the land of our birth, because of the presence of the sword of the oppressor.’ 17 They will call there, ‘Pharaoh, the king of Egypt is but a roar, he missed the opportunity.’ 18 As I live,” declares the king, Yahweh of hosts is his name, “one will come like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea. 19 Pack your baggage for exile, O inhabitants of the daughter of Egypt, for Memphis will become as a horror, and it will be destroyed, without inhabitant. 20 Egypt is a beautiful heifer, but a gadfly from the north will come against her. 21 Even her mercenaries in her midst are like calves of fattening, for they also have turned away, they have fled together. They stand not, for the day of their calamity has come upon them, the time of their punishment. 22 Her sound is like a snake that glides away, for they march in force. And with axes they come to her like those who chop trees. 23 They will cut down her forest,” declares Yahweh, “for it is impenetrable. Yes, they are more numerous than locusts, and they are without number. 24 The daughter of Egypt will be ashamed, she will be given into the hand of the people of the north.” 25 Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, said, “Look, I am going to punish Amon of Thebes, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, and her gods, and her kings, even Pharaoh and those who trust in him. 26 And I will give them into the hand of the seekers of their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and into the hand of his troops. But afterward it will be inhabited, as in days of old,” declares Yahweh. 27 “But as for you, my servant Jacob, you must not be afraid, and Israel, you must not be dismayed, for look, I am going to save you from far, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. And Jacob will return, and he will be quiet, and he will be at ease, and without one who makes him afraid. 28 You must not be afraid, my servant Jacob,” declares Yahweh, “for I am with you. For I will make a complete destruction in all the nations where I scattered you, but you I will not make a complete destruction, though I will chastise you to the measure, and I will certainly not leave you unpunished.” 1 The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked Gaza. 2 Thus says Yahweh: “Look, waters are rising from the north, and they will become as a raging torrent, and they will overflow the land, and that which fills it, the city and those who live in it. And the people will cry out, and every inhabitant of the land will wail, 3 from the sound of the stamping of the hoofs of his stallions, from the clattering of his chariots, the noise of their wheels. Fathers do not turn to their children because of the slackness of their hands. 4 Because of the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and from Sidon every survivor who could help, for Yahweh is destroying the Philistines, the remnant of the coastland of Caphtor. 5 Baldness has come upon Gaza, Ashkelon is destroyed. O remnant of their valley, how long will you cut yourself with a blade? 6 Ah, sword of Yahweh, how long will you not be quiet? Gather to your sheath, keep quiet and stand still. 7 How can you be quiet when Yahweh has given an order to it? Against Ashkelon and against the shore of the sea, there he has appointed it.” 1 Concerning Moab, thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “Woe to Nebo, for it is devastated. It is ashamed, Kiriathaim is captured. Misgab is ashamed, and it is filled with terror. 2 The glory of Moab is no longer. In Heshbon they planned evil against her. Come and let us cut her off from being a nation. Also, Madmen, you will be silent. After you will go the sword. 3 The sound of a cry of distress arises from Horonaim, devastation and great destruction. 4 Moab is broken, her little ones make heard a cry for help. 5 For the ascent of Luhith, in weeping they go weeping, For on the slope of Horonaim they have heard the distresses of the cry of distress of the destruction. 6 Flee! Save your life! For you must be like the juniper tree in the desert. 7 For because of your trusting in your works and in your treasures, even you yourselves will be taken, and Chemosh will go out into the exile, his priests and his officials together. 8 And the destroyer will come to every town, and a town will not escape. And the valley will be destroyed, and the plain will be destroyed, as Yahweh has spoken. 9 Give salt for Moab, for certainly she will go to ruin, and her towns will become as a desolation, without an inhabitant in them. 10 The one who does the work of Yahweh with slackness is cursed, and the one who keeps away blood from his sword is cursed. 11 Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has been quiet on his dregs, and he has not been poured out from vessel to vessel, and he has not gone into exile. Therefore his taste has remained unchanged, and his fragrance has not changed. 12 Therefore look, days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “and I will send to him decanters, and they will decant him, and his vessels they will empty out, and their jars they will smash. 13 Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, just as the house of Israel were ashamed of Bethel, their trust. 14 How can you say, ‘we are warriors, and men of might for the battle.’ 15 Moab is destroyed, and his towns have gone up, and the choice of his young men have gone down to the slaughtering,” declares the King, Yahweh of hosts is his name. 16 “The disaster of Moab is near to come, and his disaster approaches very quickly. 17 Mourn for him, all his surroundings, and all those who knew his name. Say, ‘How the staff of might is broken, the staff of glory.’ 18 Come down from glory and sit on the parched ground, O inhabitant, daughter of Dibon, for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you, he has destroyed your fortifications. 19 Stand by the road and watch, O inhabitant of Aroer. Ask the man who is fleeing and the woman who is escaping, say, ‘What has happened?’ 20 Moab is ashamed, for it is filled with terror. Wail and cry out, tell it by Arnon that Moab is devastated. 21 Judgment has also come to the land of the plain, to Holon, and to Jahaz, and on Mephaath, 22 and on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth-diblathaim, 23 and on Kiriathaim, and on Beth-gamul, and on Beth-meon, 24 and on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the towns of the land of Moab, the far and the near. 25 The horn of Moab is cut off and his arm is broken,” declares Yahweh. 26 “Make him drunk, because he magnified himself against Yahweh, and let Moab wallow in his vomit. And he also will become a laughingstock. 27 Now was not Israel the laughingstock to you? Or was he found among thieves? For as often as you spoke over him you shook your head. 28 Leave the towns and dwell on the rock, O inhabitants of Moab, and be like the dove, it nests on the sides of the mouth of a ravine. 29 We have heard of the pride of Moab —he is very proud— his height, and his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart. 30 I know his insolence,” declares Yahweh, “and his boastings are false; they act falsely. 31 Therefore over Moab I wail, and for all of Moab I cry out, for the people of Kir-heres I moan. 32 More than the weeping of Jazer I weep for you, O vine Sibmah. Your branches cross over the sea, up to the sea of Jazer they reach. Upon your summer fruit and upon your vintage the destroyer has fallen. 33 And joy and rejoicing have been taken away from the fruitful land, even from the land of Moab. And the wine from the wine presses I have caused to disappear. He will not tread with exuberant shouts. Exuberant shouts will not be exuberant shouts. 34 From the cry for help of Heshbon, up to Elealeh, up to Jahaz, they give their voice, from Zoar up to Horonaim, up to Eglath-shelishiyah, for even the waters of Nimrim have become as a desolation. 35 And I will cause to disappear for Moab,” declares Yahweh, “the one who presents a sacrifice at a high place, and the one who burns a smoke offering to his gods. 36 Therefore my heart moans for Moab like the flute. It moans for the people of Kir-heres like the flute. Therefore the wealth they gained has perished. 37 For on every head is baldness, and every beard is trimmed. On all the hands, slashes, and on the loins, sackcloth. 38 On all the roofs of Moab, and in its public squares, there is wailing everywhere. For I have broken Moab like a vessel, there is no delight in it,” declares Yahweh. 39 “How it is filled with terror! How they wail! How Moab has turned his back! He is disgraced! So Moab has become as a derision, and as a terror for all his surrounding peoples.” 40 For thus says Yahweh, “Look, like an eagle he will swoop down, and he will spread out his wings against Moab. 41 Kerioth will be taken, and the strongholds will be conquered, and the hearts of the warriors of Moab will be on that day like the heart of a woman who is in labor. 42 And Moab will be destroyed from being a people, because against Yahweh he magnified himself. 43 Dread, and pit, and a trapping net are against you, O inhabitant of Moab,” declares Yahweh. 44 “He who flees before the dread will fall into the pit, and the one who climbs up from the pit will be caught in the trapping net, for I will bring on Moab the year of their punishment,” declares Yahweh. 45 “In the shadow of Heshbon fugitives stand without strength, for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, and a flame from Sihon. And it has eaten the forehead of Moab, and the skulls of the people of tumult. 46 Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished. For your sons have been taken into captivity, and your daughters into captivity. 47 Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in the last of the days,” declares Yahweh. Thus far is the judgment of Moab. 1 Concerning the Ammonites: Thus says Yahweh, “Are there no sons for Israel? Or is there no heir for him? Why has Milcom taken possession of Gad, and his people dwelled in its towns? 2 Therefore look, days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “and I will sound against Rabbah, the Ammonites, the alarm of the war, and it will become as a mound of desolation, and its daughters will burn in the fire. Then Israel will dispossess his dispossessors,” says Yahweh. 3 “Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is devastated. Cry out, O daughters of Rabbah, put on sackcloth. Lament and run back and forth among the walls. For Milcom will go into exile, his priests and his officials together. 4 Why do you boast in your valleys? Your valleys are ebbing. O unfaithful daughter, who trusted in her treasures, who said, ‘Who will come against me?’ 5 Look, I am going to bring dread on you,” declares Lord Yahweh of hosts, “from all your surrounding neighbors. And you will be scattered, each one before it, and there is no one who gathers the fugitives. 6 Yet afterward I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites,” declares Yahweh. ",Jeremiah 45:1-49:6,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/jeremiah-451-496-62568/direct-download/tbd20090723.mp3
Jeremiah,"7 Concerning Edom, thus says Yahweh of hosts: “Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Has counsel become lost from those who understand? Is their wisdom rotting? 8 Flee! Turn back! Get down low! O inhabitants of Dedan. For I will bring upon him the disaster of Esau at the time when I will punish him. 9 If grape-gatherers come to you, would they not leave gleanings? If thieves in the night, they destroy only enough for them. 10 But I have stripped Esau bare. I have uncovered his hiding places, and he is not able to hide himself. His offspring are devastated, along with his brothers, and his neighbors, and he is no more. 11 Leave your orphans. I will let them live. And your widows, let them trust in me.” 12 For thus says Yahweh, “Look, those who are not condemned to drink the cup must certainly drink it. And are you the one who will go entirely unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for you must certainly drink it. 13 For I have sworn by myself,” declares Yahweh, “that Bozrah will become as a horror, as a disgrace, as a waste, and as a curse. And all her towns will be everlasting sites of ruins.” 14 I have heard a message from Yahweh, and a messenger has been sent among the nations. “Gather and come against her, and rise for the battle.” 15 “For look, I will make you small among the nations, despised by the humankind. 16 Your terror has deceived you, the pride of your heart, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, you who seize the height of the hill. Though you make your nest high like the eagle, from there I will bring you down,” declares Yahweh. 17 “And Edom will become as a horror, everyone who passes by it will be appalled, and will hiss because of all its blows. 18 As the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors,” says Yahweh, “no one will live there, and the son of humankind will not dwell as an alien in it. 19 Look, like a lion he comes up from the thickets of the Jordan to a pastureland by a constantly flowing stream. So I will chase him away hurriedly from it. And whoever is chosen I will appoint over it. For who is like me, and who can summon me? And who is this, the shepherd who can stand before me?” 20 Therefore hear the plan of Yahweh that he has planned against Edom, and his plans that he has planned against the inhabitants of Teman. Surely they will drag them away, the little ones of the flock. Surely he will cause to be desolated over them their grazing place. 21 The earth will quake from the sound of their falling. A cry of distress! Their voice will be heard at the Red Sea. 22 Look, like an eagle he will go up and he will swoop down, and he will spread out his wings against Bozrah. And the heart of the warriors of Edom will be in that day like the heart of a woman who is in labor. 23 Concerning Damascus: “Hamath and Arpad are ashamed, for they have heard bad news; they melt. There is concern in the sea. It is not able to keep quiet. 24 Damascus has grown slack. She has turned away to flee and panic. Anxiety has seized her, and labor pains have grasped her, like a woman in labor. 25 How the city of praise has not been abandoned! The city of my joy! 26 Therefore her young men will fall in her public squares, and all the soldiers will perish in that day,” declares Yahweh of hosts. 27 “And I will kindle a fire at the wall of Damascus, and it will devour the citadel fortresses of Ben-hadad.” 28 Concerning Kedar and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor that Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon defeated. Thus says Yahweh: “Rise up, go up against Kedar and destroy the people of the east. 29 They will take their tents, and their flocks, their tent curtains, and all their equipment, and their camels they will carry away for themselves, and they will call to them, ‘Terror is from all around.’ 30 Flee! Wander far away! Get down low! O inhabitants of Hazor,” declares Yahweh. “For Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, has planned a plan against you. And he has schemed a scheme against you. 31 Rise up, go up against a nation which is at ease, living securely,” declares Yahweh. “There are no gates and there are no bars for them, they dwell alone. 32 And their camels will become as plunder, and the multitude of their livestock as spoil. And I will scatter to every wind those who are trimmed to the side, and from every side I will bring their disaster,” declares Yahweh. 33 “And Hazor will become as a lair of jackals, a waste forever; no one will live there, and no son of humankind will dwell as an alien in it.” 34 The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the king of Judah, saying, 35 “Thus says Yahweh of hosts: ‘Look, I am going to break the bow of Elam, the first and best of their might. 36 And I will bring to Elam four winds, from the four corners of heaven, and I will scatter them to all these winds, and there will not be a nation where the scattered people of Elam will not go. 37 So I will shatter Elam before their enemies, and before the seekers of their life. And I will bring disaster upon them, my burning anger,’ declares Yahweh. ‘And I will send after them the sword until I have destroyed them. 38 And I will set my throne in Elam and I will destroy from there king and officials,’ declares Yahweh. 39 ‘And then in the last of the days I will restore the fortunes of Elam,’ declares Yahweh.” 1 The word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet: 2 “Declare among the nations and proclaim, and lift up a banner. Proclaim, you must not conceal it. Say, ‘Babylon is captured, Bel is ashamed, Merodach is filled with terror, her idols are ashamed, her idols are filled with terror. 3 For a nation will come up against her from the north. It will make her land as a horror, and an inhabitant will not be in her. From humans to animals they all will wander off. They will go away. 4 In those days and in that time,’ ” declares Yahweh, “the people of Israel will come, they and the people of Judah together. Weeping as they go, they will go, and Yahweh their God they will seek. 5 They will ask the way to Zion, turning their faces there. They will come and join themselves to Yahweh by an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten. 6 My people have become lost sheep, their shepherds have caused them to go astray. They led them away to the mountains. From mountain to hill they have gone, they have forgotten their resting place. 7 All those who found them have devoured them. And their foes have said, ‘We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Yahweh, the true pasture, even Yahweh, the hope of their ancestors.’ 8 Flee from the midst of Babylon, and from the land of the Chaldeans. Go out and be like he-goats before the flock. 9 For look, I am going to stir up, and I am going to bring against Babylon a contingent of great nations from the land of the north. And they will draw up a battle formation against her, from there she will be captured. Their arrows are like a warrior who has achieved success, he does not return without success. 10 And Chaldea will be as booty, all those who plunder her will be satisfied,” declares Yahweh. 11 “Though you rejoice, though you exult, O plunderers of my inheritance, though you frisk about like a heifer on the grass, and you neigh like the powerful stallions, 12 your mother will be very ashamed. She who gave birth to you will be humiliated. Look, she will be the least of the nations, a desert, dry land, and wilderness. 13 Because of the anger of Yahweh she will not be inhabited, but she will be a wasteland, all of her. Everyone who passes by Babylon will be appalled and will hiss because of all her wounds. 14 Draw up a battle formation at Babylon all around, all those who bend the bow, shoot at her. You must not spare arrows, for she has sinned against Yahweh. 15 Raise a war cry against her on all sides. She has surrendered. Her towers have fallen, her walls are ruined. For this is the vengeance of Yahweh. Take revenge on her. As she has done to others, so do to her. 16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and the one who uses the sickle in the time of harvest. Because of the sword of the oppressor each one will turn to their people, and each one will flee to their land. 17 Israel is a sheep scattered, lions drove them away. The first who devoured it was the king of Assyria, and now at the end Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, gnawed its bones.” 18 Therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “Look, I am going to punish the king of Babylon and his land just as I punished the king of Assyria. 19 And I will restore Israel to its pasture, and it will feed on Carmel, and in Bashan, and on the hills of Ephraim, and in Gilead its hunger will be satisfied. 20 In those days and at that time,” declares Yahweh, “the guilt of Israel will be sought, but there is none, and the sins of Judah, but they will not be found, for I will forgive those I left behind. 21 To the land of Merathaim, go up against her, and against the inhabitants of Pekod, massacre and destroy them,” declares Yahweh, “and do according to all that I have commanded you. 22 The sound of battle is in the land, and great destruction. 23 How the blacksmith’s hammer of all the earth is cut down and broken! How Babylon has become as a horror among the nations! 24 I laid a bird snare for you, and you were caught, O Babylon. But you yourself did not know. You were discovered and seized, because with Yahweh you measured yourself. 25 Yahweh has opened his armory, and he has brought out the weapons of his wrath, for it is a work for my Lord Yahweh of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. 26 Come against her from the end, open her granaries. Pile her up like heaps and destroy her. Let there be no remnant for her. 27 Massacre all her bulls, let them go down to the slaughtering. Woe to them, for their day has come, the time of their punishment. 28 There is the sound of fugitives and survivors from the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God, the vengeance for his temple. 29 Summon archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow. Encamp all around her, there must not be for her an escape. Take revenge on her according to her deeds. According to all that she has done, so do to her. For against Yahweh she has behaved insolently, against the Holy One of Israel. 30 Therefore her young men will fall in her public squares, and all her soldiers will perish on that day,” declares Yahweh. 31 “Look, I am against you, O arrogant one,” declares Lord Yahweh of hosts, “for your day has come, the time when I will punish you. 32 And the arrogant one will stumble and fall, and there is no one who raises him up. And I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it will devour everything around him.” 33 Thus says Yahweh of hosts: “The people of Israel are oppressed, and the people of Judah likewise, for all their captors have seized them, they refuse to let them go free. 34 Their redeemer is strong, his name is Yahweh of hosts. Surely he will plead their case, in order to make peace for the earth, but to cause unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon. 35 A sword against the Chaldeans,” declares Yahweh, “and against the inhabitants of Babylon, and against her officials, and against her wise men. 36 A sword against the oracle priests, and they will become foolish. A sword against her warriors, and they will be filled with terror. 37 A sword against his horses, and against his chariots, and against all the foreign troops who are in the midst of her, so that they may become as women. A sword against her treasures, so that they may be plundered. 38 A drought will come against her waters, and they will dry up, for it is a land of images, and because of the frightful objects, they act like madmen. 39 Therefore desert creatures will live there with jackals, and daughters of ostriches will inhabit her. And she will not be inhabited again forever, and she will not be dwelt in for all generations. 40 As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors,” declares Yahweh, “no one will live there, and the son of humankind will not dwell as an alien in her. 41 Look, a people is about to come from the north, and a great nation and many kings are woken up from the remotest part of the earth. 42 They keep hold of bow and short sword. They are cruel and they have no mercy. Their sound is like the sea, it roars, and upon horses they ride. Drawn up for battle as a man for the battle, against you, O daughter of Babylon. 43 The king of Babylon heard their report and his hands grew slack. Anxiety has seized him, fear and pain like the woman who gives birth. 44 Look, like a lion he comes up from the thickets of the Jordan against a pastureland by a constantly flowing stream, so I will chase them away quickly from her, and I will appoint whoever is chosen over her. For who is like me, and who can summon me, and who is this shepherd who can stand before me? 45 Therefore hear the plan of Yahweh that he has planned against Babylon, and his plans that he has planned against the land of the Chaldeans. Surely they will drag them away, the little ones of the flock. Surely he will cause their grazing place to be desolate over them. 46 At the sound, ‘Babylon has been captured,’ the earth will quake, and a cry for help among the nations will be heard.” 1 Thus says Yahweh: “Look, I am going to stir up against Babylon and against the inhabitants of Leb-qamai a destructive wind. 2 And I will send winnowers to Babylon, and they will winnow her, and they will lay waste her land, for they will be against her from all sides on the day of disaster. 3 Let not him who bends the bow shoot his bow, and let him not rise high in his body armor. And you must not spare her young men; destroy her whole army. 4 And they will fall slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and pierced through in her streets. 5 For neither Israel nor Judah is a widower from their God, from Yahweh of hosts, though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.” 6 Flee from the midst of Babylon and save each one his life. You must not perish because of her guilt. For this is the time of vengeance for Yahweh, he will repay her what is deserved. 7 Babylon was a cup of gold in the hand of Yahweh, making drunk all the earth. The nations drank of her wine. Therefore the nations acted like madmen. 8 Suddenly Babylon has fallen and she is shattered. Wail over her! Take balm for her wounds, perhaps she may be healed. 9 We tried to heal Babylon, and she was not healed. Forsake her and let us go each one to his country, for her judgment has reached to the heavens, and it has been lifted up to the skies. 10 Yahweh has brought forth our vindication. Come and let us make known in Zion the work of Yahweh our God. 11 Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers! Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes. Because his plan concerning Babylon is to destroy it, for that is the vengeance of Yahweh, the vengeance for his temple. 12 Against the walls of Babylon raise a banner; post a strong watch, post watchmen, prepare the ambushes, for Yahweh has both planned as well as performed what he has spoken concerning the inhabitants of Babylon. 13 O you who live by mighty waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, the measure of your life. 14 Yahweh of hosts has sworn by himself, “Surely I will fill you with troops like the creeping locusts, and they will sing over you a war cry.” 15 He is the one who made the earth by his power, the one who created the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretched out the heavens. 16 At the giving of his voice there is a roar of waters in the heavens, and he causes the patches of mist to go up from the end of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain, and he brings out the wind from his storehouses. 17 All humankind turns out to be stupid, without knowledge. Every goldsmith is put to shame by the divine image. For his cast image is a lie, and there is no breath in them. 18 They are worthless, a work of mockery. At the time of their punishment, they will perish. 19 The portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the creator of everything, and the tribe of his inheritance. Yahweh of hosts is his name. 20 He says, “You are a war club for me, a weapon of battle, and I smash nations with you, and I destroy kingdoms with you. 21 And I smash the horse with you, and its rider, and I smash the chariot with you, and its rider. 22 And I smash man and woman with you, and I smash the old man and the boy with you, and I smash the young man and the young woman with you. 23 And I smash the shepherd and his flock with you, and I smash the farmer and his team with you, and I smash the governors and the officials with you. 24 And I will repay Babylon, and all the inhabitants of Chaldea, all their wickedness that they have done in Zion before your eyes,” declares Yahweh. 25 “Look, I am against you, O mountain of the destruction,” declares Yahweh, “the one that destroys the whole earth. And I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will roll you down from the cliffs, and I will make you as a mountain burned away. 26 They will not take from you a stone for a corner, and a stone for a foundation, for you will be an everlasting desolation,” declares Yahweh. 27 Raise a banner in the land; blow a horn among the nations; prepare for holy war against her; summon the nations against her, the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz; summon against her an official; bring up horses like bristling creeping locusts. 28 Prepare the nations for holy war against her, the kings of the Medes, with their governors and all their officials, and every land of their dominion. 29 And the land quakes and writhes, for the plans of Yahweh against Babylon stand, to make the land of Babylon as a horror, without inhabitant. 30 The warriors of Babylon have ceased to fight, they remain in the strongholds, their power has dried up, they have become as women. Her dwelling places are set on fire, her bars are broken. 31 one runner runs to meet another runner, and one messenger to meet another messenger, to tell the king of Babylon that his city has been captured, from end to end. 32 And the fords have been seized, and the reed marshes have been burned with fire, and the soldiers are horrified. 33 For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trodden down, just a little while and the time of the harvest will come for her.” 34 Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me and sucked me dry; he has made me an empty vessel; he has swallowed me like the sea monster; he has filled his belly with my delicacies; he has rinsed me. 35 “May the violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon,” the inhabitants of Zion will say; and “My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,” Jerusalem will say. 36 Therefore thus says Yahweh, “Look, I am going to contend your case, and I will avenge your vengeance, and I will cause her sea to dry up, and I will cause her fountain to dry up. 37 And Babylon will become as a heap of stones, a lair of jackals, an object of horror, and an object of hissing, without inhabitants. 38 They will roar together like the young lions, they will growl like the cubs of lions. 39 At their becoming hot I will set their banquets, and I will make them drunk, so that they will fall into a swoon, and they will sleep an everlasting sleep, and they will not wake up,” declares Yahweh. 40 “I will bring them down like young rams to slaughter, like rams and goats. 41 How Sheshach is captured, and the glory of all the earth is seized! How Babylon has become as an object of horror among the nations! 42 The sea has risen over Babylon, she has been covered by the roar of its waves. 43 Her cities have become as an object of horror, a dry land and a wilderness, a land in which no person lives, nor does a son of humankind pass through it. 44 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will wrench out from his mouth what he has swallowed. And the nations will not stream towards him any longer what’s worse, the wall of Babylon has fallen. 45 Come out from her midst, my people, and save each one his life from the burning anger of Yahweh. 46 Now so that you are not fainthearted, and you are afraid at the rumors that are heard in the land— and in the year the rumor comes, and in the year after it the rumor, and violence is in the land, with ruler against ruler— 47 therefore look, days are coming, and I will punish the images of Babylon, and all her land will be put to shame, and all her slain ones will fall in the midst of her. 48 Then the heaven and the earth and all that is in them will shout for joy over Babylon, for from the north the destroyers will come to it,” declares Yahweh. 49 Babylon must fall not only because of the slain ones of Israel, but also because of Babylon the slain ones of all the earth have fallen. 50 Survivors of the sword, go! You must not linger! Remember Yahweh from far away, and let Jerusalem come to your mind. 51 We are ashamed, for we have heard taunts, disgrace covers our faces, for strangers have come to the holy places of the house of Yahweh. 52 “Therefore look, days are coming,” declares Yahweh, “and I will punish her images, and the fatally wounded will sigh through all her land. 53 Though Babylon goes up to the heavens, and though she fortifies the high place of her strength, from me destroyers will come to her,” declares Yahweh. 54 The sound of a cry for help from Babylon, and a great collapse from the land of the Chaldeans. 55 For Yahweh is devastating Babylon, and he obliterates her loud noise from her. Their waves roar like mighty waters, the roar of their voices resounds. 56 For a destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon, and her warriors are captured. Their bows are broken; for Yahweh is a God of recompense, certainly he will repay. 57 “And I will make drunk her officials, and her wise men, her governors, and her officials, and her warriors, and they will sleep an everlasting sleep, and they will not wake up,” declares the King, Yahweh of hosts is his name. 58 Thus says Yahweh of hosts: “The broad walls of Babylon will be utterly demolished, and her high gates will burn with fire, and the peoples will labor for nothing, and the nations for fire, and they will grow weary.” 59 The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah, the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, at his going with Zedekiah, the king of Judah, to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was the quartermaster. 60 And Jeremiah wrote all the disasters that would come on Babylon in one scroll, all these words that are written concerning Babylon. 61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “At your coming to Babylon, then you must see that you read aloud all these words. 62 And you must say, ‘Yahweh, you yourself spoke against this place, to destroy it, so that there will not be in it anything living, from humankind to animals, for it will be an everlasting desolation.’ 63 And then when you finish reading aloud this scroll, you must tie a stone on it, and you must throw it into the middle of the Euphrates. 64 And you must say, ‘Thus shall Babylon sink, and she will not rise, because of the face of the disasters that I am bringing on her, and they will grow weary.’ ” Thus far the words of Jeremiah. 1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old at his beginning to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 2 And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh like all that Jehoiakim had done. 3 For because of the anger of Yahweh this happened in Jerusalem and Judah until his casting them from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 4 And then in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came against Jerusalem, he and all his army. And they laid siege to it, and built siege works against it all around. 5 So the city came under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 6 In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine in the city became severe and there was no food for the people of the land. 7 Then the city was breached, and all the soldiers fled and went out from the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls that are at the garden of the king, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. And they went in the direction of the Jordan Valley. 8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him. 9 Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. 10 And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah. 11 Then he made blind the eyes of Zedekiah, and they tied him up with bronze fetters, and the king of Babylon brought him to Babylon. And he put him in prison until the day of his death. 12 Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, entered into Jerusalem. 13 And he burned the temple of Yahweh, and the palace of the king, and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house he burned with fire. 14 And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around. 15 And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard deported some of the poor of the people, and the rest of the people who were left in the city, and the deserters who deserted to the king of Babylon, along with the rest of the craftsmen. 16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land to serve as vinedressers and farmers. 17 And the Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in the temple of Yahweh, and the kettle stands and the sea of bronze that were in the temple of Yahweh, and they carried all their bronze to Babylon. 18 And they took with them the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the sprinkling bowls, and the pans, and all the vessels of bronze which were used in temple service. 19 And the captain of the guard took the bowls, and the firepans, and the sprinkling bowls, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the pans, and the libation bowls, those made of solid gold and those made of solid silver. 20 The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze oxen that were under the kettle stands which King Solomon had made for the temple of Yahweh—there was not a weight for the bronze of all these vessels! 21 Now the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a thread of twelve cubits surrounded it, and its thickness was four fingers, hollowed out. 22 And a capital upon it was bronze and the height of the one capital was five cubits, and latticework and pomegranates were on the capital on all sides, all of bronze. And like these was the second pillar with pomegranates. 23 And there were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates on the latticework on all sides were a hundred. 24 Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and three keepers of the threshold. 25 And from the city he took one high official who was chief officer over the soldiers, and seven men of the king’s advisors who were found in the city, and the secretary of the commander of the army who levied for military service the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city. 26 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 27 And the king of Babylon struck them down and killed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah left from its land. 28 This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar deported: in the seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Judeans; 29 in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, eight hundred and thirty-two persons from Jerusalem; 30 in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, deported seven hundred and forty-five Judean persons; there were four thousand six hundred persons in all. 31 And then in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach, the king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, and brought him out from prison. 32 Then he spoke with him kindly and gave his seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon. 33 So he changed the garments of his imprisonment and he ate food before him continually all the days of his life. 34 And his allowance, a continual allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon on a daily basis all the days of his life up to the day of his death.

They are estranged and gone backward. 5 Why do you want to be beaten again? You continue in rebellion. The whole of the head is sick, and the whole of the heart is faint. 6 From the sole of the foot and up to the head there is no health in it; bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed, and they have not been bound up and not softened with the oil. 7 Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire; As for your land, aliens are devouring it in your presence, and it is desolate, like devastation by foreigners. 8 And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a shelter in a cucumber field, like a city that is besieged. 9 If Yahweh of hosts had not left us survivors, we would have been as few as Sodom, we would have become like Gomorrah. 10 Hear the word of Yahweh, rulers of Sodom! Listen to the teaching of our God, people of Gomorrah! 11 What is the abundance of your sacrifices to me? says Yahweh. I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fattened animals and I do not delight in the blood of bulls and ram-lambs and goats. 12 When you come to appear before me, who asked for this from your hand: you trampling my courts? 13 You must not continue to bring offerings of futility, incense—it is an abomination to me; new moon and Sabbath, the calling of a convocation— I cannot endure iniquity with solemn assembly. 14 Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; they have become to me like a burden, I am not able to bear them. 15 And when you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not be listening. Your hands are full of blood. 16 Wash! Make yourselves clean! Remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes! Cease to do evil! 17 Learn to do good! Seek justice! Rescue the oppressed! Defend the orphan! Plead for the widow! 18 “Come now, and let us argue,” says Yahweh. “Even though your sins are like scarlet, they will be white like snow; even though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.

Isaiah,"19 If you are willing and you are obedient, you shall eat the good of the land. 20 But if you refuse and you rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword. For the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.” 21 How has a faithful city become like a whore? Full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers. 22 Your silver has become as dross; Your wine is diluted with waters. 23 Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Every one loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not defend the orphan and the legal dispute of the widow does not come before them. 24 Therefore, the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: “Ah, I will be relieved of my enemies, and I will avenge myself on my foes. 25 And I will turn my hand against you; I will purify your dross like lye, and I will remove all of your tin. 26 And I will restore your judges, as at the first, and your counselors, as at the beginning. After this you will be called the city of righteousness, faithful city. 27 Zion will be redeemed by justice, and those of her who repent, by righteousness. 28 But the destruction of rebels and sinners shall be together, and those who forsake Yahweh will perish. 29 For you will be ashamed of the oaks in which you delighted, and you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. 30 For you shall be like an oak withering its leaves, and like a garden where there is no water for her. 31 And the strong man shall become like tinder, and his work like a spark. And both of them shall burn together, and there is not one to quench them.” 1 The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem: 2 And it shall happen in the future of the days the mountain of the house of Yahweh shall be established; it will be among the highest of the mountains, and it shall be raised from the hills. All of the nations shall travel to him; 3 many peoples shall come. And they shall say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, to the house of the God of Jacob, and may he teach us part of his ways, and let us walk in his paths.” For instruction shall go out from Zion, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem. 4 He shall judge between the nations and he shall arbitrate for many peoples. They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. A nation shall not lift up a sword against a nation, and they shall not learn war again. 5 House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Yahweh. 6 For you have forsaken your people, house of Jacob, because they are full from the east, and of soothsayers like the Philistines, and they make alliances with the offspring of foreigners. 7 And its land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to its treasures; and its land is filled with horses, and there is no end to its chariots. 8 Its land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what they made with their fingers. 9 So humanity is humbled; everyone is humbled, and you must not forgive them. 10 Enter into the rock and hide yourself in the dust from the presence of the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty. 11 The haughty eyes of humanity will be brought low, and the pride of everyone will be humbled, and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day. 12 For there is a day for Yahweh of hosts against all of the proud and the lofty and against all that is lifted up and humble, 13 and against all the lofty and lifted up cedars of Lebanon, and against all the large trees of Bashan, 14 and against all the high mountains, and against all the lofty hills, 15 and against every kind of high tower, and against every kind of fortified wall, 16 and against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the ships of desire. 17 And the haughtiness of the people shall be humbled, and the pride of everyone shall be brought low, and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day. 18 And the idols shall pass away entirely, 19 and they will enter into the caves of the rocks and into the holes of the ground from the presence of the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty when he rises to terrify the earth. 20 On that day humanity will throw away its idols of silver and its idols of gold, which they made for it to worship, to the rodents and to the bats— 21 to enter into the crevices of the rocks and into the clefts of the crags from the presence of the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth. 22 Turn away from humanity, who has breath in its nostrils, for by what is it esteemed?

Isaiah,"1 For look, the Lord Yahweh of hosts is removing every source of support from Jerusalem and from Judah: all of the supplies of bread and all of the supplies of water, 2 mighty warrior and man of war, judge and prophet, and diviner and elder, 3 captain of fifty and the honorable men of rank, and counselor and skillful magicians and skillful enchanter. 4 And I will make boys their princes, and children shall rule over them. 5 And the people will be oppressed by each other and a man by his neighbor. The boy will act arrogantly toward the elder, and the dishonorable toward the honorable. 6 Indeed, a man will seize his brother in the house of his father: “You have a cloak; you shall be a leader for us, and this heap of ruins shall be under your hand!” 7 He will lift up his voice on that day, saying, “I will not be a healer; in my house there is no bread and there is no cloak. You shall not make me the leader of the people!” 8 For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen because their speech and their deeds are against Yahweh, defying the eyes of his glory. 9 The look on their faces testifies against them and they declare their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have dealt out evil to themselves. 10 Tell the innocent that it is good for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds. 11 Woe to the wicked! It is bad! For what is done by his hands will be done to him. 12 My people—children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. My people, your leaders are misleading you, and they confuse the course of your paths. 13 Yahweh takes his stand to conduct a legal case and takes his stand to judge the peoples. 14 Yahweh enters into judgment with the elders of his people and its princes. “And you! You have devoured the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses! 15 Why do you crush my people and grind the face of the poor?” declares the Lord Yahweh of hosts. 16 And Yahweh said: “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and they walk with outstretched neck, and they give flirting glances with their eyes, mincing along as they go, and with their feet they rattle their bangles, 17 the Lord will make the heads of the daughters of Zion scabby, and Yahweh will lay their foreheads bare.” 18 In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets and the headbands and the crescent necklaces, 19 the pendants and the bracelets and the veils, 20 the headdresses and the armlets and the sashes, and the perfume boxes and the amulets, 21 the signet rings and the nose rings, 22 the festal robes and the mantles, and the cloaks and the handbags, 23 and the mirrors and the linen garments, and the turbans and the wraps. 24 And this shall happen: There will be a stench instead of perfume, and a rope instead of a sash, and baldness instead of a well-set hairdo, and a clothing wrap of sackcloth instead of a rich robe, branding instead of beauty. 25 Your men shall fall by the sword, and your warriors in battle. 26 And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall be banished; she shall sit upon the ground.

Isaiah,"1 And seven women shall grasp at one man on that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread, and we will wear our own clothing; only let us be called by your name! Take away our disgrace!” 2 On that day the branch of Yahweh shall become beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall become the pride and glory of the survivors of Israel. 3 And this shall happen: He who is left in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone written for life in Jerusalem, 4 when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the blood of Jerusalem from her midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning. 5 Then Yahweh will create over all of the site of Mount Zion and over her assembly a cloud by day and smoke and the brightness of flaming fire by night. Indeed, over all the glory there will be a canopy, 6 and it will be a shelter for shade from the heat by day, and a refuge and a hiding place from rainstorm and from rain. 1 Let me sing for my beloved a song of my love concerning his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill. 2 And he dug it and cleared it of stones, and he planted it with choice vines, and he built a watchtower in the middle of it, and he even hewed out a wine vat in it, and he waited for it to yield grapes— but it yielded wild grapes. 3 And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard. 4 What more was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it? Why did I hope for it to yield grapes, and it yielded wild grapes? 5 And now let me tell you what I myself am about to do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge, and it shall become a devastation. I will break down its wall, and it shall become a trampling. 6 And I will make it a wasteland; it shall not be pruned and hoed, and it shall be overgrown with briers and thornbushes. And concerning the clouds, I will command them not to send rain down upon it. 7 For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel, and the man of Judah is the plantation of his delight. And he waited for justice, but look! Bloodshed! For righteousness, but look! A cry of distress! 8 Ah! Those who join house with house, they join field together with field until there is no place and you are caused to dwell alone in the midst of the land. 9 Yahweh of hosts said in my ears: Surely many houses shall become a desolation, large and beautiful ones without inhabitant. 10 For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer will yield an ephah. 11 Ah!

And look! It comes quickly, swiftly! 27 None is weary, and none among him stumbles; none slumbers and none sleeps. And no loincloth on his waist is opened, and no thong of his sandals is drawn away. 28 Whose arrows are sharp, and all of his bows are bent. The hoofs of his horses are reckoned like flint, and his wheels like the storm wind. 29 His roaring is like the lion, and he roars like young lions. And he growls and seizes his prey, and he carries it off, and not one can rescue it. 30 And he will roar over him on that day like the roaring of the sea, and if one looks to the land, look! Darkness! Distress!

Isaiah,"3 And the one called to the other and said, “Holy, holy, holy is Yahweh of hosts! The whole earth is full of his glory.” 4 And the pivots of the thresholds shook from the sound of those who called, and the house was filled with smoke. 5 And I said, “Woe to me! For I am destroyed! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I am living among a people of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the king, Yahweh of hosts!” 6 Then one of the seraphs flew to me, and in his hand was a hot coal he had taken from the altar with tongs. 7 And he touched my mouth, and he said, “Look! This has touched your lips and has removed your guilt, and your sin is annulled.” 8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?” And I said, “I am here! Send me!” 9 And he said, “Go and say to this people, ‘Keep on listening and do not comprehend! And keep on looking and do not understand!’ 10 Make the heart of this people insensitive, and make its ears unresponsive, and shut its eyes so that it may not look with its eyes and listen with its ears and comprehend with its mind and turn back, and it may be healed for him.” 11 Then I said, “Until when, Lord?” And he said, “Until the cities lie wasted without inhabitant, and houses without people, and the land is ruined and a waste, 12 and Yahweh sends the people far away, and the abandonment is great in the midst of the land. 13 And even if only a tenth part remain, again she will be destroyed like a terebinth or like an oak, which although felled, a tree stump remains in them.

Isaiah,"1 This happened in the days of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah. Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem for warfare against it, but he was not able to fight against it. 2 When it was reported to the house of David, saying “Aram stands by Ephraim,” his heart and the heart of his people shook like the shaking of the trees of the forest because of the wind. 3 Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, “Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the washer’s field. 4 And you must say to him, ‘Take heed and be quiet! You must not fear, and your heart must not be faint because of these two stumps of smoldering firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah. 5 Because Aram has plotted evil against you with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying, 6 “Let us go up against Judah and let us tear her apart, and let us lay it open and so bring it unto ourselves, and let us install the son of Tabeel as king in her midst.” 7 Thus says the Lord Yahweh, “It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass. 8 For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin, and in sixty-five years from now Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people. 9 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not believe then you will not endure.” ’ ” 10 And Yahweh continued to speak to Ahaz, saying, 11 “Ask for a sign for yourself from Yahweh God; make it deep as Sheol or make it high as above.” 12 But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put Yahweh to the test.” 13 Then he said, “Hear, house of David! Is it too little for you to make men weary, that you should also make my God weary? 14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look! the virgin is with child and she is about to give birth to a son, and she shall call his name ‘God with us.’ 15 He shall eat curds and honey until he knows to reject the evil and to choose the good. 16 For before the boy knows to reject the evil and to choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be abandoned. 17 “Yahweh will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your ancestor days that have not come since the day Ephraim departed from Judah: the king of Assyria.” 18 And this shall happen: On that day, Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is at the end of the stream of Egypt and the bee that is in the land of Assyria. 19 And all of them will come and settle in the rivers of the cliffs and in the clefts of the rocks and on all of the thornbushes and watering places. 20 On that day, the Lord will shave the head and the hair of the feet with a razor of the one hired from beyond the river—with the king of Assyria—and it will even take off the beard. 21 And this shall happen: on that day, a young man will keep a young cow of the herd and two sheep alive. 22 And this shall happen: because of the abundance of milk production, he will eat curds, for every one that is left in the midst of the land will eat curds and honey. 23 And this shall happen on that day: Every place where there are a thousand vines for a thousand silver pieces will become briers, and it will be thornbushes. 24 One will go there with arrows and bow, for all of the land will be briers and thornbushes. 25 And as for all of the hills that they hoed with the hoe, you will not go there, for fear of briers and thornbushes.

Isaiah,"1 Then Yahweh said to me, “Take yourself a large tablet and write on it with a common stylus pen: Maher-Halal-Hash-Baz. 2 And I will require reliable witnesses as a witness for me: Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.” 3 And I approached the prophetess, and she conceived, and she gave birth to a son. And Yahweh said to me, “Call his name Maher-Halal-Hash-Baz. 4 For before the boy knows to call ‘my father’ and ‘my mother,’ one will carry away the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria in the presence of the king of Assyria.” 5 And Yahweh continued to speak to me again, saying, 6 “Because this people has refused the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah, 7 therefore look! The Lord is bringing up the waters of the great and mighty river against them, the king of Assyria and all his glory. And he will rise above all his channels, and he will flow over all his banks. 8 And he will sweep into Judah; he will overflow and he will flood up to the neck.

And listen, all distant parts of the earth; gird yourselves and be dismayed; gird yourselves and be dismayed! 10 Make a plan, but it will be frustrated! Speak a word, but it will not stand, for God is with us! 11 For Yahweh said this to me while his hand weighed heavily on me, and he warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying, 12 “You must not call conspiracy everything that this people calls conspiracy, and you must not share its fear, and you must not be in dread. 13 You shall regard Yahweh of hosts as holy, and he is your fear, and he is your dread. 14 And he will become like a sanctuary and a stumbling-stone, and like a stumbling-rock for the two houses of Israel, like a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 15 And many shall stumble among them, and they shall fall and they shall be broken, and they shall be ensnared and they shall be caught.” 16 Bind up the testimony; seal the teaching among my disciples. 17 And I will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will await him. 18 Look! I and the children whom Yahweh has given to me are like signs and portents in Israel from Yahweh of hosts, the one who dwells on the mountain of Zion. 19 Now if they tell you, “Consult the ghosts and the spirits, those who chirp and those who mutter.

Isaiah,"1 But there will be no gloom for those who were in distress. In former times he treated the land of Zebulun and Naphtali with contempt, but in the future he will honor the way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. 2 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; light has shined on those who lived in a land of darkness. 3 You have made the nation numerous; you have not made the joy great. They rejoice in your presence as with joy at the harvest, as they rejoice when they divide plunder. 4 For you have shattered the yoke of its burden and the stick of its shoulder, the rod of its oppressor, on the day of Midian. 5 For every boot that marches and shakes the earth and garment rolled in blood will be for burning—fire fuel. 6 For a child has been born for us; a son has been given to us. And the dominion will be on his shoulder, and his name is called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 7 His dominion will grow continually, and to peace there will be no end on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and sustain it with justice and righteousness now and forever. The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this. 8 The Lord has sent out a word against Jacob, and it fell on Israel. 9 And all of the people knew it, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria in pride and arrogance of heart, saying, 10 “The bricks have fallen, but we will build with dressed stone. The sycamore-fig trees were felled, but we will replace them with cedars.” 11 So Yahweh strengthened the adversaries of Rezin against him, and he provoked his enemies— 12 Aram from the east and Philistines from the west— and they devoured Israel with the whole mouth. He has not turned away his anger in all of this, and his hand is still stretched out. 13 And the people did not turn to the one who struck it, and they did not seek Yahweh of hosts. 14 So Yahweh cut off head and tail from Israel, palm branch and reed in one day. 15 Elders and the respectable are the head, and prophets who teach lies are the tail. 16 And the leaders of this people were misleading them, and those who were led were confused. 17 Therefore the Lord did not rejoice over its young men, and he did not have compassion on its orphans and widows, for everyone was godless and an evildoer, and every mouth was speaking folly. In all of this his anger did not turn away, and still his hand is stretched out. 18 For wickedness burned like fire; it consumed brier and thorn. And it kindled the thickets of the forest, and they swirled upward in a column of smoke. 19 The land was burned through the wrath of Yahweh of hosts, and the people became like fire fuel. People had no compassion toward each other. 20 They devoured on the right but still were hungry and devoured on the left but they were not satisfied. Each one devoured the flesh of his arm, 21 Manasseh devoured Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh; together they were against Judah. In all of this his anger has not turned away, and still his hand is stretched out.

It comes from afar! To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your wealth, 4 save that they bow down under the prisoners and fall under the slain? In all of this his anger has not turned away, and still his hand is stretched out. 5 Ah! Assyria, the rod of my anger, and a staff is in their hand: my wrath! 6 I send him against a godless nation, and I command him against the people of my wrath, to capture spoil and to carry off plunder, and to make them a trampling place, like the clay of the streets. 7 But he does not think this, and his heart does not plan this. For it is in his heart to destroy and to cut off not a few nations. 8 For he says, “Are not my commanders altogether kings? 9 Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus? 10 As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols —and their images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria— 11 shall I not do to Jerusalem and its idols what I have done to Samaria and her idols?” 12 And this shall happen: when the Lord has finished all his work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, “I will punish the arrogance of the king of Assyria and his haughtiness.” 13 For he says, “I have done it by the strength of my hand and by my wisdom, for I have understanding, and I have removed the boundaries of peoples, and I have plundered their stores, and like a bull I have brought down the inhabitants. 14 And my hand has found, like a nest, the wealth of the peoples, and like the gathering of forsaken eggs, I myself have gathered all the earth. And there was no fluttering wing or open mouth or chirp.” 15 Does the ax boast against the one who cuts with it, or the saw magnify itself against the one who moves it to and fro? As if a rod should move the one who lifts it! As if a staff should lift up that which is not wood! 16 Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, will send leanness among his sturdy warriors, and a burning like the burning of fire will burn under his glory. 17 And the light of Israel will become like a fire, and his holy one like a flame, and it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day. 18 And he will destroy the glory of his forest and orchard completely, and it will be like the wasting away of one who is sick. 19 And the rest of the trees of his forest will be a small number, and a boy can write them down. 20 And this shall happen: on that day, the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will not continue to lean on the one who struck it but will lean on Yahweh, the holy one of Israel, in truth. 21 A remnant will return— the remnant of Jacob—to the mighty God. 22 For though your people Israel was like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of it will return. Annihilation is determined, overflowing with righteousness. 23 For the Lord Yahweh of hosts is about to make a complete destruction and a determined end in the midst of all the earth. 24 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh of hosts: “My people who live in Zion, you must not be afraid of Assyria. It beats you with the rod, and it lifts up its staff against you as the Egyptians did. 25 My indignation will come to an end in just a very little while, and my anger will be directed to their destruction.” 26 And Yahweh of hosts is going to swing a whip against him, as when Midian was defeated at the rock of Oreb; and his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift him up as he did in Egypt. 27 And this shall happen: on that day, he will remove his burden from your shoulder and his yoke from your neck, and a yoke will be destroyed because of fat. 28 He has come to Aiath, he has passed through Migron; at Micmash he deposited his baggage. 29 They crossed over the pass; Geba is a place of overnight lodging for us. Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul has fled. 30 Daughter of Gallim, cry out with your voice; Laishah, listen! Anathoth is poor. 31 Madmenah flees! The inhabitants of Gebim bring themselves into safety! 32 This day taking a stand at Nob, he will shake his fist at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem. 33 Look! The Lord Yahweh of hosts is about to lop off the branches with great power, and the towering trees will be felled, and the tall trees will be brought low. 34 And he will cut down the thickets of the forest with the axe, and Lebanon will fall by the mighty one.

Isaiah,"1 And a shoot will come out from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from its roots will bear fruit. 2 And the spirit of Yahweh shall rest on him— a spirit of wisdom and understanding, a spirit of counsel and might, a spirit of knowledge and the fear of Yahweh. 3 And his breath is in the fear of Yahweh. And he shall judge not by his eyesight, and he shall rebuke not by what he hears with his ears. 4 But he shall judge the poor with righteousness, and he shall decide for the needy of the earth with rectitude. And he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and he shall kill the wicked person with the breath of his lips. 5 And righteousness shall be the belt around his waist, and faithfulness the belt around his loins. 6 And a wolf shall stay with a lamb, and a leopard shall lie down with a kid, and a calf and a lion and a fatling together as a small boy leads them. 7 And a cow and a bear shall graze; their young shall lie down together. And a lion shall eat straw like the cattle. 8 And an infant shall play over a serpent’s hole, and a toddler shall put his hand on a viper’s hole. 9 They will not injure and they will not destroy on all of my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea. 10 And this shall happen on that day: the nations shall inquire of the root of Jesse, which shall be standing as a signal to the peoples, and his resting place shall be glorious. 11 And this shall happen on that day: The Lord will again extend his hand a second time to acquire the remnant of his people that is left, from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the coastlands of the sea, 12 and he will raise a signal for the nations. And he will gather the outcasts of Israel, and he will gather the scattered ones of Judah together from the four corners of the earth. 13 And the jealousy of Ephraim shall depart, and the enemies of Judah shall be cut off. Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah, and Judah shall not be an enemy of Ephraim. 14 But they shall swoop upon the Philistine shoulder, westward. Together they shall plunder the sons of the east. Edom and Moab will be under their command, and the sons of Ammon will be their subjugated people. 15 And Yahweh will divide the tongue of the sea of Egypt, and he will wave his hand over the river with his scorching wind; and he will strike it into seven streams, and he will make it passable by foot. 16 So there shall be a highway from Assyria for the remnant of his people that remains, as there was for Israel when it went up from the land of Egypt.

Isaiah,"1 And you will say on that day, “I will give you thanks, Yahweh, for though you were angry with me, your anger turned away, and you comforted me. 2 Look! God is my salvation; I will trust, and I will not be afraid, for my strength and might is Yah, Yahweh; and he has become salvation for me.” 3 And you will draw water from the wells of salvation in joy. 4 And you will say on that day, “Give thanks to Yahweh; call on his name. Make his deeds known among the peoples; bring to remembrance that his name is exalted. 5 Sing praises to Yahweh, for he has done a glorious thing; this is known in all the earth. 6 Inhabitant of Zion, shout out and sing for joy, for the holy one of Israel is great in your midst.” 1 The oracle of Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw: 2 Raise a signal on a bare hill, lift up your voice to them; wave the hand and may they enter the gateways of the noblemen. 3 I myself I have commanded my consecrated ones, I have also summoned my mighty warriors concerning my anger, the ones who exalt over my majesty. 4 A sound, a noise is on the mountains, the likeness of many people! A sound of the roar of the kingdoms, of nations gathering! Yahweh of hosts is mustering an army for battle. 5 They are coming from a distant land, from the end of the heavens, Yahweh and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole earth. 6 Wail, for the day of Yahweh is near; it will come like destruction from Shaddai! 7 Therefore all hands will grow slack, and every human heart will melt, 8 and they will be dismayed. Pangs and labor pains will seize them; they will tremble like a woman giving birth. They will stare at one another, their faces flushing. 9 Look! The day of Yahweh is coming, cruel and wrath and the burning of anger, to make the earth a desolation, and he will destroy its sinners from it. 10 For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not flash forth their light; the sun will keep back when it comes out, and the moon will not cause its light to shine. 11 And I will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their iniquity. And I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant, and I will bring the haughtiness of tyrants low. 12 I will make humanity more rare than gold and humankind more than the gold of Ophir. 13 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will quake from its place because of the wrath of Yahweh of hosts, and in the day his anger burns. 14 And this shall happen: like a hunted gazelle or sheep with none to gather them, they will each turn to his own people, and they will each flee to his own land. 15 Everyone who is found will be pierced through, and everyone who is carried away will fall by the sword. 16 And their children will be dashed into pieces before their eyes; their houses will be plundered, and their wives will be raped. 17 Look! I am stirring the Medes up against them, who do not value silver and do not delight in gold. 18 And their bows will shatter young men. And they will not show mercy on the fruit of the womb; their eyes will not look compassionately on children. 19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the splendor of the Chaldeans’ pride, will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

Isaiah,"19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the splendor of the Chaldeans’ pride, will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 20 It will not be inhabited forever, and it will not be dwelled in forever; and no Arab will pitch a tent there, and shepherds will not allow their flocks to lie down there. 21 But wild animals will lie down there, and their houses will be full of howling creatures, and the daughters of ostriches will live there, and goats will dance there. 22 And hyenas will answer in its palaces, and jackals in the pleasure palaces; and its time is coming soon, and its days will not be prolonged. 1 But Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob, and he will again choose Israel and set them on their land, and the immigrant will join himself to them, and they will attach themselves to the house of Jacob. 2 And the nations will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will take possession of them in the land of Yahweh as slaves and female slaves. And this will happen: they will take their captors captive and rule over their oppressors. 3 And it shall happen on the day Yahweh gives you rest from your pain and turmoil and hard labor which you had to perform, 4 that you will take this taunt against the king of Babylon, and you will say: “How the oppressor has ceased! his insolence has ceased. 5 Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of rulers, 6 that struck the peoples in wrath, a blow without ceasing, that ruled the nations in anger with unrestrained persecution. 7 All of the earth rests and is quiet; they break forth into singing. 8 Even the cypresses rejoice over you, the cedars of Lebanon: ‘Since you were laid down, no wood cutter comes up against us.’ 9 Sheol below is getting excited over you, to meet you when you come; it arouses the dead spirits for you, all of the leaders of the earth. It raises all of the kings of the nations from their thrones. 10 All of them will respond and say to you, ‘You yourself also were made weak like us! You have become the same as us!’ 11 Your pride is brought down to Sheol, and the sound of your harps; maggots are spread out beneath you like a bed, and your covering is worms. 12 How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of dawn! You are cut down to the ground, conqueror of nations! 13 And you yourself said in your heart, ‘I will ascend to heaven; I will raise up my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit on the mountain of assembly on the summit of Zaphon; 14 I will ascend to the high places of the clouds, I will make myself like the Most High.’ ",Isaiah 13:19-14:14,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-1319-1414-54963/direct-download/tbd20090415.mp3
Isaiah,"15 But you are brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the pit. 16 Those who see you will stare at you, they will look closely at you: ‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble, who caused kingdoms to shake, 17 who made the world like the desert and destroyed its cities, who would not let his prisoners go home?’ 18 All the kings of the nations, all of them, lie in glory, each one in his house. 19 But as for you, you are thrown away from your grave, like an abhorrent shoot, clothed with the slain, those pierced by the sword, those who go down to the stones of the pit, like a corpse that is trodden down. 20 You will not be united with them in burial because you have destroyed your land, you have killed your people. The descendants of evildoers will not be mentioned for eternity! 21 Prepare a place of slaughter for his sons because of the sin of their ancestors. Let them not rise and take possession of the earth or fill up the face of the world with cities.” 22 “And I will rise up against them,” declares Yahweh of hosts, “and I will cut off name and a remnant from Babylon, and offspring and posterity,” declares Yahweh. 23 “And I will make her a possession of the hedgehog, and pools of water, and I will sweep her away with the broom of destruction,” declares Yahweh of hosts. 24 Yahweh of hosts has sworn, saying, “Surely just as I have intended, so it shall be. And just as I have planned, it shall stand: 25 to break Assyria in my land, and I will trample him down on my mountains; and he shall remove his yoke from them, and he shall remove his burden from his shoulders.” 26 This is the plan that is planned concerning all of the earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out over all of the nations. 27 For Yahweh of hosts has planned, and who will frustrate it? And his hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back? 28 In the year of the death of king Ahaz there was this oracle: 29 You must not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken, for a viper will come forth from the root of the snake, and its fruit will be a flying serpent. 30 And the firstborn of the poor will graze, and the needy will lie down in security; but I will cause your root to die in famine, and it will kill your remnant. 31 Wail, gate! Cry, city! Melt, Philistia, all of you! For smoke is coming from the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks. 32 And what will one answer the messengers of the nation? That Yahweh has founded Zion, and the needy of his people will take refuge in it. 1 An oracle of Moab: Because Ar is devastated in a night, Moab is destroyed; because Kir of Moab is devastated in a night, it is destroyed. 2 It has gone up to the house, and Dibon to the high places for weeping over Nebo, and Moab wails over Medeba. Every head is bald, every beard is shaved. 3 They gird themselves with sackcloth in its streets; on its roofs and public squares everyone wails, going down in weeping. 4 And Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voice is heard as far as Jahaz; therefore the armed ones of Moab cry out; its soul quivers for him. 5 My heart cries out for Moab; its fugitives flee up to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah. For at the ascent of Luhith it goes up it with weeping; for on the road of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction. 6 For the waters of Nimrim are wastelands; for the grass has withered, the vegetation has vanished, there is no greenness. 7 Therefore they carry the abundance it has made and their store of goods over the river of the poplars. 8 For a cry for help has encircled the territory of Moab, her wailing is heard as far as Eglaim, and her wailing as far as Beer Elim. 9 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; but I will place added things upon Dimon: a lion for the survivors of Moab and for the remnant of the land. 1 Send a ram to the ruler of the land, from Sela across the desert to the mountain of daughter Zion. 2 And this shall be: like a bird fleeing from a thrust away nest shall be the daughters of Moab at the fords of Arnon. 3 “Bring counsel, make a decision; make your shade like the night in the middle of noonday. Hide the outcasts; you must not betray the fugitive. 4 Let my outcasts of Moab dwell as aliens among you; be a hiding place for them from the presence of the destroyer.” When the oppressor is no more, destruction has stopped, the one who tramples has disappeared from the land, 5 then a throne shall be established in steadfast love, and one shall sit on it in faithfulness, in the tent of David, judging and seeking justice and zealous for righteousness. 6 We have heard of the pride of Moab—exceedingly proud— of his arrogance, pride, and insolence; his boasting is not true. 7 Therefore Moab wails; all of it wails for Moab, for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth you moan, utterly devastated. 8 For Heshbon withers the fields, the vine of Sibmah; rulers of nations have broken down her tendrils, they reached up to Jazer, they wandered to the desert; her shoots spread abroad, they crossed over the sea. 9 Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah. I drench you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh, for a jubilant shout has fallen over your summer fruit and harvest. 10 And joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful land, and in the vineyards no one exults, no one shouts for joy; no treader treads wine in the presses; I have put to an end to the jubilant shout. 11 Therefore my heart moans like a harp for Moab and my inner parts for Kir-heres. 12 And this shall happen: when Moab appears, when it is weary upon the high place and it comes to its sanctuary to pray, it will not prevail. 13 This was the word that Yahweh spoke to Moab in the past. 14 But now Yahweh speaks, saying, “In three years, like the years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will become contemptible, with all of the great multitude, and the remnant will be a few, small, not strong.

Damascus will cease being a city and will become a heap of ruins. 2 The cities of Aroer will be deserted; they will be for the flocks, and they will lie down and no one will frighten them. 3 And the fortified city will disappear from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus; and the remnant of Aram will be like the glory of the children of Israel,” declares Yahweh of hosts. 4 “And this shall happen: On that day, the glory of Jacob will be brought low, and the fat of his flesh will become lean. 5 And it shall be as when a reaper gathers standing grain and he reaps grain with his arm, and it shall be like one who gathers ears of grain in the valley of Rephaim. 6 And gleanings will be left over in it, as when an olive tree is beaten, two or three ripe olive berries in the top of a branch, four or five on its fruitful branches,” declares Yahweh, the God of Israel. 7 On that day, mankind will look to its maker, and its eyes will look to the holy one of Israel; 8 it will not look to the altars, the work of its hands, and it will not see what its fingers made and the poles of Asherah worship and the incense altars. 9 On that day, its fortified cities will be like the abandonment of the wooded place and the summit, which they deserted because of the children of Israel; and there will be desolation. 10 For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and you have not remembered the rock of your refuge; therefore you plant plants of pleasantness, and you plant a vine of a foreigner. 11 On your planting day you make them grow, and in the morning of your sowing you bring them into bloom, yet the harvest will flee in a day of sickness and incurable pain. 12 Ah! The noise of many peoples, they make a noise like the noise of the seas! And the roar of nations, they roar like the roar of mighty waters! 13 The nations roar like the roar of many waters, but he will rebuke him, and he will flee far away. And they are chased like chaff of the mountains before the wind and like tumbleweed before the storm. 14 At the time of evening, and look, terror! Before morning he is no more. This is the fate of those who plunder us and the lot of those who plunder us. 1 Ah! land of the whirring of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Cush, 2 that sends messengers by the sea and in vessels of papyrus on the surface of the waters! Go, swift messengers, to a tall and smooth nation, to a people feared near and far, a mighty, mighty and trampling nation, whose land rivers divide. 3 All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers of the earth, when a signal is raised on the mountains, you must look, and when a trumpet is blown, you must listen! 4 For Yahweh said this to me: “I will be quiet, and I will look from my dwelling place like clear heat because of light, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.” 5 For before the harvest, when the blossom is complete and a blossom becomes ripening fruit, and one cuts off the shoots with pruning hooks, and one removes, tears away the tendrils. 6 They shall all be left for birds of prey of the mountains and for the animals of the earth. And the birds of prey will pass the summer on it, and every animal of the earth will winter on it. 7 At that time, a gift will be brought to Yahweh of hosts from a tall and smooth people, and from a people feared near and far, a mighty, mighty and trampling nation, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of Yahweh of hosts, the mountain of Zion.

Isaiah,"1 An oracle of Egypt: Look! Yahweh is riding on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt. And the idols of Egypt will tremble in front of him, and the heart of Egypt melts in his inner parts. 2 “And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians, and each one will fight against his brother and each one against his neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom. 3 And the spirit of the Egyptians will be disturbed in his midst, and I will confuse his plans, and they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead, and the ghosts and the spiritists. 4 And I will hand over the Egyptians into the hand of a hard master, and a powerful king will rule over them,” declares the Lord Yahweh of hosts. 5 And the waters will be dried up from the sea, and the river will be parched and dry. 6 And the rivers will become foul-smelling; the branches of the Nile of Egypt will become little and dry up; reed and rush will wither. 7 Bare places by the Nile will be dried up, by the edge of the Nile and all the sown land of the Nile; it will be driven about, and it will be no more. 8 And the fishers will mourn, and all of those who cast fishhooks in the Nile will lament, and those who spread out fishing nets on the surface of the water will languish. 9 And the workers of combed flax will be ashamed, and those who weave white linen. 10 And her weavers will be crushed; all the hired workers will be grieved of heart. 11 Surely the princes of Zoan are foolish; the wise of the counselors of Pharaoh give senseless counsel. How can you say to Pharaoh, “I myself am a son of sages, a descendant of ancient kings”? 12 Where are your sages then? Now, let them tell you, and let them know what Yahweh of hosts has planned against Egypt. 13 The princes of Zoan have become foolish; the princes of Memphis are deceived; the leaders of her tribes have led Egypt astray. 14 Yahweh has mixed a spirit of confusion into her midst, and they have caused Egypt to stagger in all of its doings, as when a drunkard staggers in his vomit. 15 And there will be nothing for Egypt to do, head or tail, palm branch or reed. 16 On that day, Egypt will be like women, and will tremble and be afraid before the waving hand of Yahweh of hosts that he is waving against it. 17 And the land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt, everyone to whom one mentions it will be afraid in himself because of the plan of Yahweh of hosts that he is planning against him. 18 On that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan and swear an oath to Yahweh of hosts. One will be called “City of the Sun.” 19 On that day, there will be an altar for Yahweh in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a stone pillar for Yahweh at her border. 20 And it will be a sign and a witness to Yahweh of hosts in the land of Egypt; when they cry out to Yahweh because of oppressors, he will send them a savior and a defender, and he will deliver them. 21 And Yahweh will make himself known to Egypt, and Egypt will know Yahweh on that day, and they will worship with sacrifice and offering, and they will make vows to Yahweh, and they will fulfill them. 22 And Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing; and they will return to Yahweh, and he will respond to their prayer, and he will heal them. 23 On that day, there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria will come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, and Egypt will worship together with Assyria. 24 On that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth, 25 whom Yahweh of hosts blessed, saying, “May Egypt my people be blessed, and Assyria, the work of my hands, and my inheritance, Israel.” 1 In the year the commander-in-chief came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and he took it, 2 at that time, Yahweh had spoken by the hand of Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, “Go and loosen the sackcloth from your loins, and take off your sandals from your feet,” and he had done so, walking naked and barefoot. 3 Then Yahweh said, “Just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and Cush, 4 so shall the king of Assyria lead the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, with bared buttocks, the shame of Egypt. 5 And they shall be dismayed, and they shall be ashamed because of Cush, their hope, and because of Egypt, their pride. 6 And the inhabitant of the coastland will say this on that day: ‘Look! This is our hope to whom we fled for help, to be delivered from the king of Assyria, and how shall we escape?’ ” ",Isaiah 19-20,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-19-20-54966/direct-download/tbd20090420.mp3
Isaiah,"1 The oracle of the wilderness of the sea: As storm winds passing over in the Negev, it comes from the desert, from a frightful land. 2 A hard revelation is told to me; the treacherous deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; lay siege, Media! I put an end to all of her sighing. 3 Therefore my loins are filled with anguish; pangs have seized me, like the pangs of a woman giving birth. I am too bent to hear, I am too dismayed to see. 4 My mind staggers; fear terrifies me; the twilight I desired brought me fear. 5 Set out the table in order! Spread out the rugs! Eat! drink! Rise up, commanders; smear the shield! 6 For the Lord said this to me: “Go, set a watchman in position. He must announce what he sees. 7 When he sees riders, a pair of horsemen, riders of donkeys, riders of camels, then he must listen attentively, paying attention, paying special attention.” 8 Then the watchman called, “Lord, I am standing on the watchtower continually by day, and I am standing at my post throughout the night. 9 And look at this! A man’s chariot is coming, a pair of horsemen!” Then he responded and said, “It has fallen! Babylon has fallen! And all the images of her gods are smashed on the ground!” 10 My downtrodden people and the son of my threshing floor, I will announce to you what I have heard from Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel. 11 The oracle of Dumah: One is calling to me from Seir, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?” 12 The watchman says, “Morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire; come back again.” 13 An oracle concerning Arabia: You will spend the night in the thicket in a desert-plateau, caravans of Dedanites. 14 When you happen to meet the thirsty, bring water. Inhabitants of the land of Tema came to meet the fugitive with his bread. 15 For they have fled from the swords, from the drawn sword and the bent bow, and from the heaviness of the battle. 16 For the Lord said this to me: “In one more year, like the years of a hired worker, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end. 17 And the remainder of the number of the bows of the warriors of the sons of Kedar will be few.” For Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken. 1 The oracle of the valley of vision: What business do you have going up, all of you, to the roofs, 2 noisy, tumultuous city, exultant town? Your slain are not slain by the sword, nor are they dead from battle. 3 All of your rulers have fled together without a bow; all of you who were found were captured. They were captured together; they had fled far away. 4 Therefore I said, “Look away from me, let me weep bitterly; you must not insist on comforting me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.” 5 For the Lord Yahweh of hosts has a day of tumult and trampling and confusion in the valley of vision, a tearing down of walls and a cry for help to the mountains. 6 And Elam lifted up the quiver, with chariots of men and cavalry. And Kir uncovered the shield. 7 And this happened: the choicest of your valleys were full of chariots, and the cavalry confidently stood at the gate. 8 And he uncovered the covering of Judah. And you looked, on that day, to the weapons of the House of the Forest, 9 and you saw that the breaches in the walls of the city of David were many, and you gathered the waters of the lower pool. 10 And you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. 11 And you made a reservoir between the walls for the waters of the old pool, but you did not look to its maker, and you did not see the one who created it long ago. 12 And the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, called on that day for weeping and mourning, and for baldness and girding with sackcloth. 13 But look! Joy and gladness, the killing of oxen and the slaughtering of sheep, the eating of meat and the drinking of wine! “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!” 14 And it was revealed in my ears by Yahweh of hosts: “Surely this sin will not be atoned for you until you die!” says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts. 15 The Lord, Yahweh of hosts, says this: “Go! Go to this steward, to Shebna, who is over the house: 16 ‘What business do you have here, and who do you have here, that you have cut a grave cutting here for yourself, carving his grave on the height, a dwelling place for him in the rock? 17 Look! Yahweh is about to really hurl you, man! And he is about to grasp you firmly; 18 he will wind a winding tightly around you like a ball, to a wide land. There you shall die, and there the chariots of your splendor will be, disgrace to your master’s house! 19 And I will push you from your office, and he will throw you down from your position. 20 And this shall happen: On that day I will call to my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, 21 and I will clothe him with your tunic, and I will bind your sash firmly about him, and I will put your authority into his hand, and he shall be like a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. 22 And I will put the key of the house of David on his shoulder, and he shall open and no one will be able to shut; and he shall shut and no one will be able to open. 23 And I will drive him in like a peg into a secure place, and he will become like a throne of glory to the house of his father. 24 And they will hang all of the heaviness of his father’s house on him, the offspring and the offshoot, all of the small vessels, from the bowls to the jars. 25 On that day, declares Yahweh of hosts, the peg that was driven will move away into a secure place, and it will be cut down and fall, and the load that was on her will be cut off. For Yahweh has spoken.’ ” ",Isaiah 21-22,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-21-22-54967/direct-download/tbd20090421.mp3
Isaiah,"1 The oracle of Tyre: Wail, ships of Tarshish, for the house is destroyed so that no one can enter; it is announced to them from the land of Cyprus. 2 Be still, inhabitants of the coast, merchant of Sidon, who travels over the sea, they filled you. 3 And on the great waters is the seed of Shihor, the harvest of the Nile is its produce, and she was the merchandise of the nations. 4 Be ashamed, Sidon, for the sea, the fortress of the sea said, saying, “I was not in labor, and I have not given birth, and I have not reared young men, brought up young women.” 5 When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report about Tyre. 6 Cross over to Tarshish! Wail, inhabitants of the coast! 7 Is this your exultant one, her origin from the days of long ago? Her feet brought her to dwell afar as an alien. 8 Who has planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants were princes, her traders the honored ones of the earth? 9 Yahweh of hosts has planned it: to defile the pride of all glory, to humble all the honored ones of the earth. 10 Cross over your own land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish; there is no longer a harbor. 11 He has stretched his hand out over the sea; he has made kingdoms shake. Yahweh has commanded concerning Canaan to destroy her fortresses. 12 And he said, “You will not continue to exult, crushed one, virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, cross over to Cyprus! There will be no rest for you even there.” 13 Look at the land of the Chaldeans! This people no longer exists. Assyria destined it for wild animals. They erected its siege towers; they demolished its citadel fortresses. It made her like a ruin. 14 Wail, ships of Tarshish! For your fortress is destroyed. 15 And this will happen on that day: And Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, like the days of one king. At the end of seventy years, it will be for Tyre like the song of the prostitute: 16 “Take a harp, go around the city, forgotten prostitute! Do it well, playing a stringed instrument! Make numerous songs, that you may be remembered.” 17 And this shall happen: at the end of seventy years, Yahweh will visit Tyre, and she will return to her harlot’s wages, and she will commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. 18 And this shall happen: her merchandise and her harlot’s wages will be set apart for Yahweh; it will not be stored up, and it will not be hoarded, but her merchandise will be for those who live before the presence of Yahweh, for eating to satiation and for fine clothing. 1 Look! Yahweh is about to lay the earth waste and is about to devastate it, and he will twist her surface, and he will scatter her inhabitants. 2 And it shall be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the slave, so with his master; as with the female slave, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the one to whom he lends. 3 The earth shall be utterly laid waste, and it shall be utterly plundered, for Yahweh has spoken this word. 4 The earth dries up, it withers; the world languishes, it withers. The elevated of the people of the earth languish, 5 and the earth is defiled beneath its inhabitants. For they have transgressed laws; they have passed by statutes; they have broken the everlasting covenant. 6 Therefore a curse devours the earth, and the inhabitants in it suffer for their guilt. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth burn, and few men are left. 7 The new wine dries up; the vine languishes. All the merry of heart sigh; 8 the joy of the tambourine has stopped. The noise of the jubilant has ceased; the joy of the lyre has stopped. 9 They do not drink wine with song; strong drink is bitter to those who drink it. 10 The city of emptiness is broken; every house is shut so that no one can enter; 11 there is an outcry over the wine in the streets. All joy turns into darkness; the joy of the earth disappears. 12 Desolation is left in the city; the gate is crushed into a state of ruin. 13 For it shall be like this in the midst of the earth, among the nations, like the beating of an olive tree, like gleanings when a grape harvest is at an end. 14 They lift up their voices; they sing for joy; they shout out from the west over the majesty of Yahweh. 15 Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, the name of Yahweh the God of Israel in the coastlands of the sea.

Isaiah,"16 We hear songs from the edge of the earth: “Glory to the righteous one!” But I say, “Ruin to me! Ruin to me! Woe to me! The treacherous ones deal treacherously, and the treacherous ones deal treacherously with treachery!” 17 Terror and the pit and the snare are upon you, inhabitants of the earth! 18 And this shall happen: The one who flees from the sound of the terror shall fall into the pit, and the one who goes up from inside the pit shall be caught in the snare, for the windows from heaven are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble. 19 The earth is utterly broken; the earth is torn asunder; the earth is shaken violently. 20 The earth staggers to and fro like the drunkard, and it sways like a hut, and its transgression is heavy upon it, and it falls and does not rise again. 21 And this shall happen on that day: Yahweh will punish the host of heaven in heaven, and the kings of the earth on the earth. 22 And they will be gathered in a gathering, like a prisoner in a pit. And they will be shut in a prison and be punished after many days. 23 And the full moon will be ashamed and the sun will be ashamed, for Yahweh of hosts will rule on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his elders in glory. 1 Yahweh, you are my God; I will exalt you. I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, plans of old, in faithfulness, trustworthiness. 2 For you have made the city a heap, the fortified city a ruin, the palace of foreigners is no longer a city; it will never be rebuilt. 3 Therefore strong peoples will glorify you; a city of ruthless nations, they will fear you. 4 For you have been a refuge to the poor, a refuge to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the rainstorm, a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless was like a rainstorm against a wall, 5 the noise of foreigners like heat in a dry land. You subdued the heat with the shade of a cloud; the song of the ruthless was silenced. 6 And on this mountain Yahweh of hosts will make for all peoples a rich feast, a feast of aged wines, fat filled with marrow, filtered aged wine. 7 And on this mountain he will destroy the face of the shroud, the shroud over all peoples, and the woven covering over all nations. 8 He will destroy death forever, and the Lord Yahweh will wipe off the tears from all faces, and he will remove the disgrace of his people from all the earth, for Yahweh has spoken. 9 And one will say, on that day, “Look! This is our God! We have waited for him and he saved us! This is Yahweh; we waited for him! Let us be glad, and let us rejoice in his salvation.” 10 For the hand of Yahweh will rest on this mountain, and Moab shall be trampled down under him as a heap of straw is trampled down in waters of a dung heap. 11 And it will spread out its hands in the midst of it, just as the swimmer spreads out to swim, and its pride will be brought low with the movement of its hands. 12 And he will throw down the fortification of the high point of your walls; he will bring it low; he will send it to the ground, to the dust. 1 On that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah: “We have a strong city; he sets up victory like walls and ramparts! 2 Open the gates so that the righteous nation who keeps faithfulness may enter! 3 You will protect a firm inclination in peace, in peace because he trusts in you. 4 Trust in Yahweh forever, for in Yah, Yahweh you have an everlasting rock. 5 For he has thrown down the inhabitants of the height, he lays low the lofty city. He lays it low to the ground; he throws her to the dust. 6 The foot tramples it, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy.” 7 The way of the righteous is a straight path; you clear the level path of the righteous. 8 Surely we wait for you in the path of your judgments, Yahweh, for your name and renown are the desire of the soul. 9 I desire you with all my soul in the night; also I seek you with my spirit within me, for when your judgments are upon the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. 10 Though the wicked person is shown compassion, he does not learn righteousness; he acts unjustly in the land of uprightness, and he does not see the majesty of Yahweh. 11 Yahweh, though your hand reaches high, they do not see it. Let them see, and let them be ashamed of the zeal of people. Indeed, let the fire of your enemies consume them. 12 Yahweh, you will establish peace for us, for you have done even all of our works for us. 13 Yahweh, our God, lords besides you ruled over us, but we praise your name alone. 14 The dead do not live; dead spirits do not rise because you have punished and destroyed them, and you have destroyed all memory of them. 15 You have added to the nation, Yahweh. You have added to the nation; you are honored. You have extended all the ends of the land. 16 Yahweh, in distress they have visited you; they poured out an incantation; your discipline was on them. 17 Like a pregnant woman on the point of giving birth, she writhes; she cries in her labor pains. So we were because of your presence, Yahweh. 18 We became pregnant, we writhed; we gave birth to wind. We cannot bring about deliverance on the earth, and no inhabitants of the world are born.

Isaiah,"19 Your dead shall live; their corpses shall rise. Wake up and sing for joy, dwellers of the dust, for your dew is celestial dew, and the earth will give birth to dead spirits. 20 Go, my people, enter into your chambers and shut your doors behind you; hide for a very little while, until the wrath has passed over. 21 For look! Yahweh is about to come out from his place to punish the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth against him, and the earth will disclose her blood and will no longer cover her slain. 1 On that day, Yahweh will punish with his cruel, great and strong sword Leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and Leviathan, the twisting serpent, and he will kill the sea monster that is in the sea. 2 On that day: “A vineyard of beauty! Sing in praise of it! 3 I, Yahweh, am her keeper; I water it again and again. Lest one afflict harm on it, I guard it night and day; 4 I have no wrath. Whatever gives me thorns and briers, I will step forth against in battle. I will set it on fire altogether. 5 Or let it grasp at my protection; let it make peace with me; peace let it make with me.” 6 Days are coming, let Jacob take root; Israel will blossom and send out shoots, and they will fill the face of the world with fruit. 7 Does he strike him as he struck down those who struck him? Or is he killed as those who killed him were killed? 8 By expelling her, by her sending away, you argue with her. He removed them with his strong wind, in the day of the east wind. 9 Therefore by this he will make atonement for the guilt of Jacob, and this will be all of the fruit of the removal of his sin: when he makes all the stones of the altar like crushed stones of chalk, no poles of Asherah worship or incense altars will stand. 10 For the fortified city is solitary, a settlement deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness; the calf grazes there, lies down there and destroys its branches. 11 When its branches are dry, they are broken; women are coming and setting light to it. For it is not a people of understanding; therefore his maker will not have compassion on him, and his creator will not show him favor. 12 And this shall happen: on that day, Yahweh will thresh from the floodwaters of the Euphrates to the wadi of Egypt, and as for you, you will be gathered one by one, sons of Israel. 13 And this shall happen: on that day, a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were lost in the land of Assyria will come, and those who were scattered in the land of Egypt, and they will bow down to Yahweh on the holy mountain at Jerusalem. 1 Ah! The garland of the pride of the drunkards of Ephraim and the withering flower of the glory of his beauty, which is at the head of the rich valley, ones overcome with wine! 2 Look! The Lord has a mighty and strong one, like a rainstorm of hail, a wind storm of destruction, like a rainstorm of mighty overflowing waters, he will put them to the earth with his hand. 3 The garland of the pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trampled by feet, 4 and the withering flower of the glory of its beauty which is at the head of the rich valley will be like its early fig before summer, which the one who sees it swallows while it is still in his hand. 5 In that day, Yahweh of hosts will become a garland of glory and a diadem of beauty to the remnant of his people, ",Isaiah 26:19-28:5,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-2619-285-54970/direct-download/tbd20090424.mp3
Isaiah,"5 In that day, Yahweh of hosts will become a garland of glory and a diadem of beauty to the remnant of his people, 6 and a spirit of justice to the one who sits over judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate. 7 And these also stagger because of wine and stagger because of strong drink; priest and prophet stagger because of strong drink; they are confused because of wine. They stagger because of strong drink; they err in vision. They stagger in the rendering of a decision, 8 for all the tables are full of disgusting vomit, with no place left. 9 To whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from milk, those taken from the breast? 10 For it is blah-blah upon blah-blah, blah-blah upon blah-blah, gah-gah upon gah-gah, gah-gah upon gah-gah, a little here, a little there. 11 For he will speak with stammering and another tongue to this people, 12 to whom he has said, “This is rest; give rest to the weary; and this is repose”; yet they were not willing to hear. 13 And to them the word of Yahweh will be blah-blah upon blah-blah blah-blah upon blah-blah gah-gah upon gah-gah gah-gah upon gah-gah, a little here, a little there, so that they may go and stumble backward and be broken and ensnared and captured. 14 Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, men of mockery, rulers of these people in Jerusalem: 15 Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death, and we have made an agreement with Sheol. The overwhelming flood, when it passes through, will not come to us, for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves in falsehood.” 16 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this: “Look! I am laying a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a founded foundation: ‘The one who trusts will not panic.’ 17 And I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line; and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and waters will flood over the hiding place. 18 And your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; you will become a trampling place for the overwhelming flood when it passes through. 19 As often as it passes through, it will take you, for morning by morning it will pass through, in the day and in the night, and understanding the message will be only terror.” 20 For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the covering is too narrow when wrapping oneself. 21 For Yahweh will rise up as at Mount Perazim; he will rave as in the valley at Gibeon to do his deed—his deed is strange— and to work his work—his work is alien! 22 And now you must not scoff, or your bonds will be strong, for I have heard from the Lord, Yahweh of hosts: complete destruction decreed upon all the land. 23 Listen, and hear my voice! Listen attentively, and hear my word! 24 Is it all day that the plowman plows, opens to sow seed, harrows his ground? 25 When he has leveled its surface, does he not scatter dill, and sow cumin seed, and plant wheat in planted rows, and barley in an appointed place, and spelt grain as its border? 26 And his God instructs him about the prescription; he teaches him. 27 For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, nor is a wheel of a utility cart rolled over cumin, but dill is beaten out with a stick, and cumin with a rod. 28 Grain is crushed fine, but certainly one does not thresh it forever; and one drives the wheel of his cart, but his horses do not crush it. 29 This also comes forth from Yahweh of hosts. He is wonderful in advice; he makes great wisdom. 1 Ah! Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year, let festivals recur. 2 Yet I will inflict Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation, and it shall be to me like an altar hearth. 3 And I will encamp in a circle against you, and I will lay siege to you with towers and I will raise up siegeworks against you. 4 Then you shall be low; you shall speak from the earth, and your words will be low, from dust. And your voice will be from the earth, like a ghost, and your word will whisper from the dust. 5 But the multitude of your strangers shall be like fine dust, and the multitude of tyrants like chaff that passes by. And it will happen in an instant, suddenly. 6 You will be punished by Yahweh of hosts with thunder and earthquake and great sound, storm wind and tempest and the flame of a devouring fire. 7 And the multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel, all those who fight against her and her stronghold, and those who inflict her shall be like a dream, a vision of the night. 8 And it shall be as when the hungry person dreams—look, he is eating! And he wakes up and his inner self is empty. Or as when the thirsty person dreams—look, he is drinking! And he wakes up and look, he is faint, and his inner self is longing for water.

Isaiah,"5 But the multitude of your strangers shall be like fine dust, and the multitude of tyrants like chaff that passes by. And it will happen in an instant, suddenly. 6 You will be punished by Yahweh of hosts with thunder and earthquake and great sound, storm wind and tempest and the flame of a devouring fire. 7 And the multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel, all those who fight against her and her stronghold, and those who inflict her shall be like a dream, a vision of the night. 8 And it shall be as when the hungry person dreams—look, he is eating!

So shall be the multitude of all the nations who fight against Mount Zion. 9 Be astonished and be amazed! Blind yourselves and be blinded! They are drunk but not from wine; they stagger but not from strong drink. 10 For Yahweh has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and he has shut your eyes, the prophets, and he has covered your heads, the seers. 11 And the vision of all this has become for you like the words of a sealed document. When they give it to one who knows the document, saying, “Read this now!” He says, “I am not able, for it is sealed.” 12 And if the document is given to one who does not know how to read, saying, “Read this now!” he says, “I do not know how to read.” 13 And the Lord said, “Because this people draw near with its mouth, and with its lips it honors me, and its heart is far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men that has been taught, 14 therefore look, I am again doing something spectacular and a spectacle with this spectacular people. And the wisdom of its wise men shall perish, and the discernment of its discerning ones shall keep itself hidden.” 15 Ah! Those who make a plan deep, to hide it from Yahweh, and their deeds are in a dark place. And they say, “Who sees us? And who knows us?” 16 Your perversity! As if a potter shall be regarded as the clay! That the product of its maker says, “He did not make me,” and the thing made into shape says of its potter, “He has no understanding.” 17 In a very little while shall not Lebanon change into a fruitful land, and the fruitful land be regarded as a forest? 18 And on that day, the deaf shall hear the words of a scroll, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of gloom and darkness. 19 And the meek have joy after joy in Yahweh, and the needy of the people shall rejoice in the holy one of Israel. 20 For the tyrant shall be no more, and the scoffer shall come to an end. And all those lying in wait for evil shall be cut off; 21 those who mislead a person into sin with a word and set a trap for the arbitrator in the gate and guide away the righteous by emptiness. 22 Therefore Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, says this to the house of Jacob: “Jacob will no longer be ashamed, and his face will no longer grow pale. 23 For when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they will treat my name as holy, and they will treat the holy one of Jacob as holy, and they will stand in awe of the God of Israel. 24 And those who err in spirit will acquire understanding, and those who grumble will learn instruction. 1 “Oh rebellious children!” declares Yahweh, “to make a plan, but not from me, and pour out a libation, but not from my Spirit, so as to add sin to sin. 2 Who go to go down to Egypt, but they do not ask of my mouth, to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt. 3 And the protection of Pharaoh shall be shame to you, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt, humiliation. 4 For his officials are at Zoan, and his envoys reach to Hanes. 5 Everyone will start to stink because of a people that cannot profit them, not for help and not for profiting, but for shame and also for disgrace.” 6 An oracle of the animals of the Negev: Through a land of trouble and distress, of lioness and lion, among them are snake and flying serpent; they carry their wealth on the backs of male donkeys and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people that cannot profit them. 7 For Egyptians help with vanity and emptiness, therefore I have called this one “Rahab, they are sitting.” 8 Now go, write it on a tablet with them, and inscribe it on a scroll, that it may be for the time to come, forever, forever. 9 For it is a people of rebellion, deceitful children, children who are not willing to hear the instruction of Yahweh, 10 who say to those who do see, “You must not see!” and to the seers, “You must not see truth for us; speak smooth things to us, see illusions, 11 turn aside from the way, turn aside from the path, put an end to the holy one of Israel from our face.” 12 Therefore the holy one of Israel says this: “Because you are rejecting this word and you trust in oppression and cunning and you rely on it, 13 therefore this iniquity shall come for you like a breach about to fall, bulging out on a high wall that breaks suddenly, in an instant. 14 And he breaks it like a vessel of a potter breaks, that is crushed; he has no compassion, and no potsherd is found among its fragments to take fire from the hearth, or to skim water from the cistern.” 15 For the Lord Yahweh, the holy one of Israel, said this: “In returning and rest you shall be saved; your strength shall be in quietness and in trust.” But you were not willing, 16 and you said, “No! For we will flee on horses!” Therefore you shall flee! And, “We will ride on swift horses!” Therefore your pursuers shall be swift! 17 One thousand because of a threat of one, because of a threat of five you shall flee, until you are left like a flagstaff on top of a mountain, and like a signal on a hill. 18 Therefore Yahweh waits to be gracious to you, and therefore he will rise up to show you mercy, for Yahweh is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him. 19 For people will live in Zion; in Jerusalem, you will surely not weep. Surely he will be gracious to you; when he hears the sound of your cry, he will answer you. 20 And the Lord will give you the bread of distress and the water of oppression, but your teachers will not hide themselves any longer. And your eyes shall see your teachers. 21 And your ears shall hear a word from behind you, saying, “this is the way; walk in it,” when you go to your right and when you go to your left. 22 And you will defile the plating of your silver idols and the covering of your gold image. You will scatter them like contaminated things; you will say to it, “Filth!” 23 And he will give rain for your seed with which you sow the ground, and grain, the produce of the ground, and it will be rich and fertile. On that day, your cattle will graze in broad pastures; 24 and the oxen and the donkeys that till the ground will eat fodder, sorrel that has been winnowed with shovel and pitchfork. 25 And there will be streams on every high mountain and elevated hill, watercourses of water, on a day of great slaughter, when towers fall. 26 And the light of the full moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, on the day when Yahweh binds up the breakage of his people, and he heals the wound of his blow. 27 Look! The name of Yahweh comes from afar, burning with his anger and heaviness of cloud. His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is like a devouring fire. 28 And his breath is like an overflowing river; it reaches up to the neck to shake the nations with the sieve of worthlessness; and a bridle that leads astray is on the jawbones of the peoples. 29 You shall have a song as in the night when a holy festival is kept, and a gladness of heart like one who goes with the flute, to go to the mountain of Yahweh, to the rock of Israel. 30 And Yahweh will cause the majesty of his voice to be heard, and he will cause the descent of his arm to be seen, in furious anger and a flame of devouring fire, with a cloudburst and a rainstorm and stones of hail. 31 Indeed, Assyria will be shattered by the voice of Yahweh; he strikes with the rod. 32 And every stroke of the staff of foundation that Yahweh lays will be on it with timbrels and lyres, and he will fight against it with battles of brandishing. 33 For Topheth has been prepared from yesterday; indeed, it is made ready for the king. He makes its pile of wood deep and wide; he makes fire and wood abundant. The breath of Yahweh burns in it like a stream of sulfur. 1 Ah! Those who go down to Egypt for help! They rely on horses and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very numerous, and they do not look to the holy one of Israel, and they do not consult Yahweh. 2 And indeed, he is wise, and he brings disaster, and he does not remove his words, and he will rise against the house of evildoers and against the help of workers of iniquity. 3 And the Egyptians are human and not God, and their horses are flesh and not spirit. And Yahweh stretches out his hand, and the helper will stumble, and the one being helped will fall, and together all of them will come to an end. 4 For Yahweh said this to me: “As which a lion growls and a young lion over its prey when a full group of shepherds is called against him, it is not terrified by their voice, and to their noise it does not respond, so Yahweh of hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion and upon its hill. 5 Like birds flying overhead, so Yahweh of hosts will protect Jerusalem; he will protect and deliver it; he will pass over and rescue it. 6 Turn back to the one against whom the sons of Israel have made deep rebellion. 7 For on that day, each one will reject his idols of silver and his idols of gold which your hands have made in sin for you. 8 And Assyria shall fall by a sword not of a man, and a sword not of a human shall devour him; and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be put to forced labor. 9 And his rock will pass over because of terror, and his officers will be terrified because of the flag,” declares Yahweh, who has a fire in Zion and has a furnace in Jerusalem.

Isaiah,"1 See, a king will rule according to righteousness, and princes will rule according to justice. 2 And each one will be like a hiding place from the wind and a covering from the rainstorm, like streams of water in a dry region, like the shade of a large rock in a weary land. 3 And the eyes of those who see will not gaze, and the ears of those who hear will listen. 4 And the minds of the rash will understand knowledge, and the tongues of stammerers will hasten to speak clearly. 5 A fool will no longer be called noble, and a scoundrel will not be said to be eminent. 6 For a fool speaks folly, and his mind does iniquity: to behave wickedly, and to speak error concerning Yahweh, to leave the throat of the hungry empty, and he deprives the thirsty of drink. 7 And a scoundrel, his weapons are evil; he plans evil devices to ruin the poor with words of deception even when the speech of the needy is right. 8 But the nobleman plans noble things, and he stands upon noble things. 9 Women who are at ease, rise up; hear my voice! Carefree daughters, listen to my word! 10 In a year you will tremble, carefree ones, for the vintage will come to an end; the harvest will not come. 11 Tremble, you who are at ease; tremble, carefree ones; strip, and strip yourself, and gird yourself on your loins, 12 mourning over breasts, over fields of delight, over the fruitful vine, 13 over the soil of my people. It goes up in thorns and briers, indeed over all of the houses of joy in the jubilant city. 14 For the palace will be forsaken, the crowded city deserted; the hill and the watchtower will become a cave forever, the joy of wild asses, a pasture for flocks. 15 Until a spirit is poured out on us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is reckoned as the forest. 16 Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness will live in the fruitful field. 17 And the work of righteousness will be peace, and the work of righteousness, quietness and security forever. 18 And my people will dwell in a settlement of peace and in a dwelling place of security and in undisturbed resting places. 19 And it hails when the forest comes down, and the city will become low in humiliation. 20 Happy are you who sow by all waters, who let the foot of the ox and the donkey go free. 1 Ah, destroyer, and yourself not destroyed! And treacherous one, and no one has dealt treacherously with him! When you cease destroying, you will be destroyed. When you stop dealing treacherously, one will deal treacherously with you. 2 Yahweh, be gracious to us, we wait for you. Be our arm in the mornings, indeed our salvation in the time of trouble. 3 At the sound of tumult, peoples fled; because of your exaltation, nations scattered. 4 And your spoil is gathered, as the gathering of the locust, as a swarm of locusts storming on it. 5 Yahweh is exalted, for he dwells on high; he filled Zion with justice and righteousness, 6 and he will be the security of your times, an abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of Yahweh is his treasure. 7 Look! Their heroes cry out in the street; the messengers of peace weep bitterly. 8 Highways are deserted; the traveler on the road ceases. One breaks a treaty, he rejects the cities, he does not hold man in high regard. 9 The land mourns; it languishes. Lebanon feels abashed; it withers. Sharon is like the desert, and Bashan and Carmel are losing their leaves. 10 “Now I will arise,” says Yahweh. “Now I will lift myself up proudly; now I will raise myself. 11 You conceive dry grass, you bring forth stubble; your breath is a fire; it will consume you. 12 And the peoples will be burning to lime— they are burned like thorns that have been cut down in the fire. 13 You who are far away, hear what I have done; and you who are near, know my might!” 14 Sinners are afraid in Zion; trembling has seized the godless: “Who of us can live with devouring fire? Who of us can live with everlasting consuming hearths?” 15 He who walks in righteousness and speaks uprightness, who rejects the gain of extortion, who refuses a bribe, who stops up his ears from hearing bloodshed and shuts his eyes from seeing evil. 16 That one will live on the heights; the fortresses of rocks will be his refuge. His food will be given; his waters will endure. 17 Your eyes will see the king in his beauty; they will see a distant land. 18 Your mind will meditate on the terror: “Where is the one who counted? Where is the one who weighed out? Where is the one who counted the towers?” 19 You will not see the insolent people, the people whose language is too obscure to understand, whose stammering of tongue cannot be understood. 20 Look on Zion, the city of our appointed festivals! Your eyes will see Jerusalem, an undisturbed settlement, a tent that is not moved. No one will ever pull out its tent pegs, and none of its ropes will be torn in two. 21 Rather, there Yahweh will be mighty for us, a place of rivers and broad streams, a galley ship with oars cannot go in it, and a mighty ship cannot pass through it. 22 For Yahweh is our judge; Yahweh is our lawgiver. Yahweh is our king; he is the one who will save us. 23 Your riggings hang slack; they do not hold the base of their mast firm, they do not spread out the sail. Then the prey of spoil in abundance will be divided; the lame will take plunder. 24 And no inhabitant will say, “I am sick”; the people who live in it, their iniquity will be taken away.

Isaiah,"1 Come near, nations, to hear; and peoples, listen attentively! Let the earth hear, and that which fills it; the world and all its offspring. 2 For the anger of Yahweh is against all the nations, and his wrath is against all their armies; he has put them under a ban, he has given them up for slaughter. 3 And their slain shall be cast out; as for their corpses, their stench shall go up. And the mountains shall melt with their blood, 4 and all the host of heaven shall rot. And the skies shall roll up like a scroll, and all their host shall wither like the withering of a leaf from a vine, or like the withering from a fig tree. 5 When my sword is drenched in the heavens, look! It will descend upon Edom, and upon the people of my ban, for judgment. 6 Yahweh has a sword; it is full of blood. It is covered with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams, for Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. 7 And wild oxen shall go down with them, and steers with strong bulls. And their land shall be drenched with blood, and their soil shall be fattened with fat. 8 For Yahweh has a day of vengeance, a year of retribution for the strife of Zion. 9 And its streams shall be changed to pitch and its soil to sulfur, and its land shall become like burning pitch. 10 Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall be in ruins; forever and ever there will be no one who passes through her. 11 But the large bird and the hedgehog shall take possession of it, and the owl and the raven shall live in it. And he shall stretch the measuring line of confusion out over it, and the plumb line of emptiness. 12 Its nobles—but no kingdom is there—shall call, and all its princes shall be nothing. 13 And thorns shall go up her citadel fortress, weeds and thistle plants in her fortresses; and it shall be the settlement of jackals, green grass for the daughters of an ostrich. 14 And desert creatures shall meet with hyenas, and a goat-demon shall call to his neighbor; surely there Lilith shall repose, and she shall find a resting place for herself. 15 There the owl shall nest and lay and hatch and care for her chicks in her shadow; surely there the birds of prey shall be gathered, each one with her mate. 16 Seek from the book of Yahweh and read; none of these shall be missing; none shall miss her mate. For my mouth is the one that has commanded, and his spirit is the one that has gathered them. 17 And he is the one that has cast the lot for them, and his hand has apportioned it to them with the measuring line; they shall take possession of it forever, they shall live in it from generation to generation. 1 Wilderness and dry land shall be glad, and desert shall rejoice and blossom like the crocus. 2 It shall blossom abundantly, and it shall rejoice indeed with rejoicing and exulting. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They are the ones who shall see the glory of Yahweh, the majesty of our God. 3 Strengthen the weak hands and make the staggering knees firm. 4 Say to those who are hasty of heart, “Be strong; you must not fear! Look! your God will come with vengeance, with divine retribution. He is the one who will come and save you.” 5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be opened. 6 Then the lame shall leap like the deer, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing for joy, for waters shall break forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert. 7 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water. Her resting place is in a settlement of jackals; the grass shall become like reeds and rushes. 8 And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called the way of holiness. The unclean shall not travel through it, but it is for them, he who walks on the way; and fools shall not wander about. 9 No lion shall be there, and no ferocious wild beast shall go up it. It shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there. 10 And the ransomed of Yahweh shall return, and they shall come to Zion with rejoicing. And everlasting joy shall be on their head; joy and gladness shall overtake them, and sorrow and sighing shall flee.

Isaiah,"1 And this happened: In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria went up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and he captured them. 2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah, with a large army, and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the field of the washer. 3 And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, came out to him, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the reminder. 4 And Rabshakeh said to them, “Now say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: “What is this confidence in which you trust? 5 I said, ‘Only a word of lips! War has power and a plan!’ Now, in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me? 6 Look, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, which if a man leans on it, goes into his hand and bores through it! Such is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all those who trust in him. 7 And if you say to me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God,’ was it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed? And he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall bow down in the presence of this altar.’ ” 8 And now please make a wager with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, that is, if you are able to put riders for yourself on them! 9 But how can you drive back one governor among the least of my master’s servants, when you trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen? 10 And now was it without Yahweh that I have come up against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, “Go up against this land and destroy it!” ’ ” 11 And Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we can understand it, and you must not speak to us in Judean in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.” 12 But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your masters and you? Was it not for the people who sit on the wall, to eat their dung and drink their urine with you?” 13 Then Rabshakeh stood and called in a great voice in Judean and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 14 Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you! 15 And do not let Hezekiah make you rely on Yahweh, saying, “Surely Yahweh will deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!” 16 You must not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: “Make a blessing with me, and come out to me, and each one will eat from his vine and from his fig tree and drink water from his cistern, 17 until I come and take you to a land like your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, 18 lest Hezekiah mislead you, saying, ‘Yahweh will save us!’ Did the gods of the nations each save his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? 19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, have they delivered Samaria from my hand? 20 Who are there among all the gods of these countries who have saved their land from my hand, that Yahweh should save Jerusalem from my hand?” ’ ” 21 But they were silent and did not answer him a word, for the command of the king was, “You must not answer him.” 22 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was over the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the reminder, came to Hezekiah with torn garments and told him the words of Rabshakeh. 1 And this happened: When King Hezekiah heard, he tore his garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and entered the temple of Yahweh. 2 And he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebna the secretary, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet. 3 And they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah: ‘This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace, for children have come to the cervical opening, and there is no strength to give birth. 4 Maybe Yahweh your God heard the words of Rabshakeh whom the king of Assyria, his master, has sent to taunt the living God, and he will rebuke the words that Yahweh your God hears. And you must lift up a prayer for the benefit of the remnant that is found.’ ” 5 When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, 6 Isaiah said to them, “You must say this to your master: ‘Thus says Yahweh: “You must not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. 7 Look! I am about to put a spirit in him so that he shall hear a rumor and he shall return to his land, and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his land.” ’ ” 8 And Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had left from Lachish. 9 Now he heard concerning Tirhakah the king of Cush, saying, “He has set out to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 10 “You shall say this to Hezekiah, king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust in him deceive you by saying, “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” 11 Look! you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands to destroy them, and you—shall you be delivered? 12 Did the gods of the nations that my predecessors destroyed deliver them—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar? 13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, or Ivvah?’ ” 14 And Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers, and he read it. Then he went up to the temple of Yahweh, and Hezekiah spread it out before the presence of Yahweh. 15 And Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying, 16 “Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel who is enthroned on the cherubim, you are the one, God by yourself, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you are the one who made the heavens and the earth. 17 Yahweh, extend your ear and hear! Yahweh, open your eyes and see, and hear all the words of Sennacherib that he has sent to taunt the living God! 18 Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the lands and their land, 19 to set their gods in the fire, for they were not gods, but the work of human hands, wood and stone, and they destroyed them. 20 So now, Yahweh, our God, save us from his hand so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh, you alone!” 21 And Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: ‘Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib, king of Assyria, 22 this is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: She shows contempt for you; she derides you, virgin daughter of Zion; she shakes her head behind you, daughter of Jerusalem. 23 Whom have you taunted and blasphemed, and against whom have you raised up your voice and lifted your eyes upward? To the holy one of Israel! 24 By the hand of your servants you have taunted the Lord, and you have said, “With my many chariots, I myself have gone up the height of the mountains, to the remote areas of Lebanon. And I cut off its tall cedars, the choicest of its junipers. And I came to the height of its limit, the forest of its orchard. 25 I myself dug and drank waters, and I caused all the streams of Egypt to dry up by the sole of my feet.” 26 Have you not heard from a long time ago? I have made it from days of primeval time, and I formed it. Now I have brought it about, and it is for fortified cities to collapse into heaps of destroyed stones. 27 And their inhabitants are weak; they are dismayed, and they are ashamed; they have become like plants of the field, and like greens of grass, like grass on the roofs and a cultivated field before the standing grain. 28 And I know your sitting down and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me. 29 Because you were enraged against me, and your noise has come up to my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle on your lips, and I will turn you back on the way by which you came. 30 And this shall be the sign for you: the eating of volunteer plants this year, and in the second year self-seeded plants, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. 31 And the remnant of the house of Judah that remain shall grow roots downwards and make fruit upwards. 32 For a remnant shall go out from Jerusalem and survivors from mountain Zion. The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this.’ 33 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria: ‘He shall not come to this city, and he shall not shoot an arrow there, and he shall not meet it with a shield, and he shall not heap a siege ramp up against her. 34 He shall return by the way that he came, and he shall not come to this city,’ declares Yahweh. 35 ‘And I will defend this city, to save it for my sake and for the sake of David, my servant.’ ” 36 And the angel of Yahweh set out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. When they rose in the morning, look! All of them were dead corpses. 37 Then Sennacherib king of Assyria left, went, and returned and lived at Nineveh. 38 And this happened: he was bowing in worship in the house of Nisroch his god, and Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him with the sword. And they themselves escaped to the land of Ararat, and Esar-haddon his son reigned as king in his place.

Isaiah,"1 In those days, Hezekiah became sick to death, and Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet, came to him and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Order your house, for you are about to die, and you shall not recover.’ ” 2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh, 3 and he said, “O Yahweh, please remember how I have walked before your presence in faithfulness with a whole heart, and I have done the good in your eyes!” And Hezekiah wept with great weeping. 4 Then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah, saying, 5 “Go and say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your ancestor: “I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Look, I am going to add fifteen years to your days. 6 And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.” ’ 7 And this is the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken: 8 Look! I will cause the shadow of the steps, which it had gone down on the steps of Ahaz with the sun, to turn backwards ten steps.” And the sun turned back ten steps on the steps which it had gone down. 9 A writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, when he was sick and had recovered from his sickness: 10 I was the one who said, “I must go in the quiet of my days; I am summoned through the gates of Sheol for the rest of my years.” 11 I said, “I shall not see Yah! Yah in the land of the living! I shall no more look at humankind among the inhabitants of the world. 12 My dwelling place is pulled up and removed from me like the tent of my shepherd; I have rolled up my life like a weaver. He cuts me off from the thrum; from day to night you bring me to an end. 13 I lie down until morning; like a lion, so he breaks all my bones; from day to night you bring me to an end. 14 Like a horse or a crane, so I chirp; I moan like a dove. My eyes are weak toward the height. Lord, I have oppression; lend me support! 15 What can I say? For he has spoken to me, and he himself has done it. I will walk slowly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul. 16 Lord, they live by them, and the life of my spirit belongs to all among them. And restore me to health and keep me alive! 17 Look! Bitterness was bitter to me for peace. And you were the one who loved my life from the pit of destruction, for you have cast all my sins behind your back. 18 For Sheol cannot praise you; death cannot praise you. Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness. 19 The living, the living one praises you like me today; a father will make your faithfulness known to children. 20 Yahweh, save me, and we will play my music on stringed instruments all the days of our lives at the temple of Yahweh.” 21 And Isaiah said, “Let them take a lump of figs, and let them rub it on the boil so that he may recover.” 22 And Hezekiah said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the temple of Yahweh?” 1 At that time, Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and recovered. 2 And Hezekiah rejoiced over them and showed them his house of aromatic gum, the silver, gold, spices, good oil, all the house of his weapons, and all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing that Hezekiah had not shown them in his house or in all his dominion. 3 And Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?” And Hezekiah answered, “They came to me from a distant country, from Babylon.” 4 And he said, “What have they seen in your house?” And Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing that I have not shown them in my storehouses.” 5 And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of Yahweh of hosts: 6 ‘Look! days are coming, and all that is in your house and that which your ancestors have stored up to this day shall be carried off to Babylon. Nothing shall be left,’ says Yahweh. 7 ‘And some of your sons who go out from you, whom you fathered, shall be taken, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’ ” 8 And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of Yahweh that you have spoken is good,” for he thought, “Surely there will be peace and security in my days.” ",Isaiah 38-39,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-38-39-54976/direct-download/tbd20090504.mp3
Isaiah,"1 “Comfort; comfort my people,” says your God. 2 “Speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and call to her, that her compulsory labor is fulfilled, that her sin is paid for, that she has received from the hand of Yahweh double for all her sins.” 3 A voice is calling in the wilderness, “Clear the way of Yahweh! Make a highway smooth in the desert for our God! 4 Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill shall become low, And the rough ground shall be like a plain, and the rugged ground like a valley-plain. 5 And the glory of Yahweh shall be revealed, and all humankind together shall see it, for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.” 6 A voice is saying, “Call!” And he said, “What shall I call?” All humankind are grass, and all his loyalty is like the flowers of the field. 7 Grass withers; the flower withers when the breath of Yahweh blows on it. Surely the people are grass. 8 Grass withers; the flower withers, but the word of our God will stand forever. 9 Get yourself up to a high mountain, Zion, bringer of good news! Lift up your voice with strength, Jerusalem, bringer of good news! Lift it up; you must not fear! Say to the cities of Judah, “Here is your God!” 10 Look! The Lord Yahweh comes with strength, and his arm rules for him. Look! His reward is with him, and his recompense in his presence. 11 He will feed his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs in his arm, and he will carry them in his bosom; he will lead those who nurse. 12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens with a span, comprehended the dust of the earth in a third of a measure and weighed out the mountains in the scales, and the hills in a balance? 13 Who has measured up the spirit of Yahweh or informed him as his counselor? 14 With whom has he consulted, that he enlightened him and taught him the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and made the way of understanding known to him? 15 Look! The nations are like a drop from a bucket, and they are counted like dust of the balances! Look! He weighs the islands like a thin covering. 16 And Lebanon is not enough to light a fire, and its animals not enough for a burnt offering. 17 All the nations are like nothing before him; they are counted by him as nothing and emptiness. 18 And to whom will you liken God? And to what likeness will you compare him? 19 A craftsman pours out the idol, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold, and he smelts chains of silver. 20 The one who is too impoverished for a gift chooses wood that will not rot; he seeks a skillful artisan for himself to set up an image that will not be knocked over. 21 Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told to you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundation of the earth? 22 He is the one who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; the one who stretches out the heavens like a veil and spreads them out like a tent to live in, 23 the one who brings princes to nothing; he makes rulers of the earth like nothing. 24 Indeed, hardly are they planted; indeed, hardly are they sown; indeed, hardly has their shoot taken root in the earth when he blows on them and they wither, and the tempest carries them like stubble. 25 “And to whom you will compare me, and am I equal?” says the holy one. 26 Lift your eyes up on high, and see! Who created these? The one who brings out their host by number. He calls all them by name. Because he is great of power and mighty of power, not one is missing. 27 Why do you say, Jacob, and you speak, Israel, “My way is hidden from Yahweh, and my judgment is passed over by my God?” 28 Have you not known, or have you not heard? Yahweh is the God of eternity, the creator of the ends of the earth! He is not faint, and he does not grow weary! There is no searching his understanding. 29 He gives power to the weary, and he increases power for the powerless. 30 Even young people will be faint and grow weary, and the young will stumble, exhausted. 31 But those who wait for Yahweh shall renew their strength. They shall go up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not grow weary; they shall walk and not be faint.

Isaiah,"1 Listen to me in silence, coastlands, and let nations renew their strength. Let them approach, then let them speak; let us draw near together for judgment. 2 Who has roused salvation from the east, summoned him to his foot, gives nations in his presence, and subjugates kings? He makes them like the dust with his sword, like scattered stubble with his bow. 3 He pursues them and passes on in peace; he does not enter the path with his feet. 4 Who has accomplished and done this, calling the generations from the beginning? I, Yahweh, am first; and I am the one with the last. 5 The coastlands have seen and are afraid; the ends of the earth tremble. They have drawn near, and they have come. 6 Each one helps his neighbor; he says to his brother, “Take courage!” 7 And the artisan encourages the goldsmith, the one who makes smooth with the hammer encourages the one who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, “It is good!” And they strengthen it with nails so it cannot be knocked over. 8 But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, you, the offspring of Abraham my friend, 9 you whom I grasped from the ends of the earth and called from its remotest parts and told, “You are my servant; I have chosen you and I have not rejected you.” 10 You must not fear, for I am with you; you must not be afraid, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, indeed I will help you, indeed I will take hold of you with the right hand of my salvation. 11 Look! All those who are angry with you shall be ashamed and humiliated; your opponents shall be like nothing and shall become lost. 12 You shall seek them, but you shall not find them; your opponents shall be like nothing, and the men of your war like nothing. 13 For I, Yahweh your God, am grasping your right hand; it is I who say to you, “You must not fear; I myself, I will help you. 14 You must not fear, O worm of Jacob; people of Israel, I myself, I will help you,” declares Yahweh, “and your redeemer is the holy one of Israel. 15 Look! I will make you into a new sharp threshing sledge, with sharp edges. You shall thresh and crush the mountains, and you shall make the hills like chaff. 16 You shall winnow them and the wind shall carry them, and the tempest shall scatter them. And you yourself shall rejoice in Yahweh; you shall boast in the holy one of Israel. 17 The poor and the needy are seeking water and there is none; their tongue is dried up with thirst. I, Yahweh, will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. 18 I will open rivers on the barren heights and fountains in the midst of the valleys. I will make the wilderness like a pool of water and the land of dryness like springs of water. 19 I will put the cedar, acacia, myrtle, and olive oil tree in the wilderness; I will set the cypress, elm, and box tree together in the desert 20 so that they may see and know, and take to heart and understand together that the hand of Yahweh has done this, and the holy one of Israel has created it.” 21 “Present your legal case,” says Yahweh. “Bring your evidence,” says the king of Jacob. 22 Let them bring them, and let them tell us what will happen. Tell us what the former things are so that we may take them to our heart and know their outcome. Declare to us the things to come; 23 tell us the things coming hereafter, that we may know that you are gods. Indeed, do good or do evil, that we may be afraid and see together. 24 Look! you are nothing, and your work is something worthless; whoever chooses you is an abomination. 25 I stirred up one from the north, and he has come from the rising of the sun. He shall call on my name, and he shall come on officials as on mortar, and as the potter treads clay. 26 Who declared it from the beginning so that we might know, and beforehand so that we might say, “He is right!” Indeed, there was no one who declared it; Indeed, there was no one who proclaimed it. Indeed there was no one who heard your words. 27 First to Zion, look! Look at them! And I give a herald of good tidings to Jerusalem. 28 But I look and there is no man, and I look among these and there is no counselor, that I might ask them and they might answer a word. 29 Look! All of them are deception; their works are nothing; their images are wind and emptiness. 1 Look! here is my servant; I hold him, my chosen one, in whom my soul delights. I have put my spirit on him; he will bring justice forth to the nations. 2 He will not cry out and lift up and make his voice heard in the street. 3 He will not break a broken reed, and he will not extinguish a dim wick. He will bring justice forth in faithfulness. 4 He will not grow faint, and he will not be broken until he has established justice in the earth. And the coastlands wait for his teaching. 5 Thus says the God, Yahweh, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and its offspring, who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it. 6 “I am Yahweh; I have called you in righteousness, and I have grasped your hand and watched over you; and I have given you as a covenant of the people, as a light of the nations, 7 to open the blind eyes, to bring the prisoner out from the dungeon, those who sit in darkness from the house of imprisonment. 8 I am Yahweh; that is my name, and I do not give my glory to another, nor my praise to the idols. 9 Look! the former things have come, and I declare new things. I announce them to you before they sprout up.” 10 Sing a new song to Yahweh; praise him from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea and that which fills it, the coastlands and their inhabitants. 11 Let the desert and its towns lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy; let them shout loudly from the top of the mountains. 12 Let them give glory to Yahweh and declare his praise in the coastlands. 13 Yahweh goes forth like a mighty warrior; he stirs up zeal like a man of war. He raises the war cry, indeed he raises the battle shout; he prevails against his foes. 14 I have been silent for a long time; I have kept silent; I have restrained myself like one giving birth; I will moan, pant, and gasp together. 15 I will cause mountains and hills to dry up, and I will cause all their herbage to wither; and I will make rivers like islands, and I will cause pools to dry up. 16 And I will lead the blind by a road they do not know; I will cause them to tread on paths they have not known. I will make darkness in their presence into light and rough places into level ground. These are the things I will do, and I will not forsake them. 17 They shall turn back; they shall be greatly ashamed, those who trust in an image, who say to a cast image, “You are our gods.” 18 Deaf people, listen! And blind people, look to see! 19 Who is blind but my servant or deaf like my messenger whom I sent? Who is blind like the one who is repaid or blind like the servant of Yahweh? 20 You see many things, but you do not observe. His ears are open, but he does not hear. 21 Yahweh was willing for the sake of his righteousness; he showed his teaching to be great and proved it to be glorious. 22 But this is a people plundered and looted; all of them are trapped in holes, and they are kept hidden in houses of imprisonment. They have become like plunder, and there is no one who saves; like booty, and there is no one who says, “Restore!” 23 Who among you will heed this, will listen attentively and listen, for the time to come? 24 Who gave Jacob to a plunderer and Israel to those who plunder? Was it not Yahweh, against whom we have sinned? And they were not willing to walk in his ways, and they would not obey his law. 25 So he poured the wrath of his anger upon him and the strength of war. And it set him afire all around, but he did not understand; and it burned him, but he did not take it to heart.

Isaiah,"1 But now thus says Yahweh, he who created you, Jacob, and he who formed you, Israel: “You must not fear, for I have redeemed you. I have called you by your name; you are mine. 2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you, and through the rivers, they shall not flow over you. When you walk through fire, you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not scorch you. 3 For I am Yahweh, your God, the holy one of Israel, your savior. I give you Egypt as ransom, Cush and Seba in place of you. 4 Because you are precious in my eyes, you are honored, and I myself love you, and I give people in place of you, and nations in place of your life. 5 You must not fear, for I am with you. I will bring your offspring from the east, and I will gather you from the west. 6 I will say to the north, ‘Give!’ and to the south, ‘You must not withhold!’ Bring my sons from far away, and my daughters from the end of the earth— 7 everyone who is called by my name, and whom I created for my glory, whom I formed, indeed whom I made.” 8 Bring out the people blind yet with eyes, and deaf, though they have ears. 9 Let all the nations gather together, and let the peoples assemble. Who among them has declared this, and declared the former things to us? Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be in the right, and let them hear and say, “It is true!” 10 “You are my witnesses,” declares Yahweh, “and my servant whom I have chosen so that you may know and believe in me and understand that I am he. No god was formed before me, and none shall be after me. 11 I myself am Yahweh, and there is no savior besides me! 12 I myself declared and saved, and I proclaimed. And there was no strange god among you. And you are my witnesses,” declares Yahweh, “and I am God. 13 Indeed, from this day I am the one, and no one can deliver from my hand. I perform, and who can cancel it?” 14 Thus says Yahweh, your redeemer, the holy one of Israel: “For your sake I will send to Babylon, and I will cause all of them to fall down as fugitives, and the Chaldeans, their rejoicing on the ships. 15 I am Yahweh, your holy one, the creator of Israel, your king.” 16 Thus says Yahweh, who makes a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters, 17 who brings out chariot and horse, army and mighty one. Together they lie down; they cannot rise. They are extinguished, quenched like a wick. 18 “You must not remember the former things, and you not must consider the former things. 19 Look! I am about to do a new thing! Now it sprouts! Do you not perceive it? Indeed, I will make a way in the wilderness, rivers in the desert. 20 The animals of the field will honor me, jackals and daughters of the ostrich, for I give water in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give a drink to my chosen people, 21 this people whom I formed for myself, so they might make known my praise. 22 But you did not call me, Jacob; for you have become weary of me, Israel. 23 You have not brought me your sheep for a burnt offering nor honored me with your sacrifice. I have not made you serve with offerings, nor have I made you weary with frankincense. 24 You have not bought me spice reed with money or satisfied me with the fat of sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins; you have made me weary with your iniquities. 25 I, I am the one who blots out your transgressions for my sake, and I will not remember your sins. 26 Take me to court; let us enter into judgment together. You, make an account so that you may be in the right. 27 Your first ancestor sinned, and your representatives transgressed against me. 28 And I profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and I gave Jacob to destruction, and Israel to reviling. 1 “But now hear, Jacob my servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen. 2 Thus says Yahweh, who made you, and who formed you in the womb and will help you: you must not fear, my servant Jacob, and Jeshurun whom I have chosen. 3 For I will pour out water on a thirsty land and streams on dry ground. I will pour my spirit out on your descendants and my blessing on your offspring. 4 And they shall sprout among the grass like willows by a watercourse of water. 5 This one will say, ‘I belong to Yahweh!’ And that one will be called by the name of Jacob, and another will write on his hand ‘Yahweh’s’ and take the name of Israel.” 6 Thus says Yahweh, the king of Israel, and its redeemer, Yahweh of hosts: “I am the first, and I am the last, and there is no god besides me. 7 And who is like me? Let him proclaim it! And let him declare it and set it in order for me since I established an eternal people and things that are to come, and let them tell them the things that are coming. 8 You must not tremble, and you must not be paralyzed with fear. Have I not made you hear from of old and declared it, and you are my witnesses? Is there a god besides me? And there is no rock! I know none!” 9 All those who form an idol are nothing, and their delightful things do not profit. And their witnesses do not see or know, so they will be ashamed. 10 Who would form a god and cast an image of which he cannot profit? 11 Look! all his companions shall be ashamed, and the artisans are human! Let all of them assemble; let them stand up. They shall tremble; they shall be ashamed together. 12 The ironsmith works in the coals with his tool and forms it with hammers. And he makes it with his strong arm; indeed, he becomes hungry, and he lacks strength; he does not drink water, and he is faint. 13 The woodworker stretches out a line; he makes an outline of it with a marker. He makes it with a knife and makes an outline of it with a compass. He makes it like the image of a man, like the beauty of a human, to dwell in a temple. 14 Cutting down cedars for himself, he chooses a holm tree and an oak, and he lets it grow strong for him among the trees of the forest. He plants a cedar, and the rain makes it grow. 15 And it becomes fuel for a human, and he takes some of it and grows warm; also, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. Also, he makes a god and bows in worship; he makes himself an image and bows down to it! 16 He burns half of it in the fire; he eats meat over half of it; he roasts a roast and is satisfied. Also he grows warm and says, “Ah! I am warm! I see the fire!” 17 And he makes the remainder of it into a god! He bows down to his idol, and he bows in worship and prays to him, and he says, “Save me, for you are my god!” 18 They do not know, and they do not understand, for their eyes are besmeared so that they cannot see, their minds so that they have no insight. 19 And no one takes it to heart, and there is no knowledge and no understanding to say, “I burned half of it in the fire and also I baked bread on its coals; I roasted meat, and I have eaten. And I shall make the rest of it into an abomination! I shall bow down to a block of wood!” 20 He feeds on ashes; a deceived mind misleads him. And he cannot save himself, and he cannot say, “Is this not an illusion in my right hand?” 21 “Remember these things, Jacob, and Israel, for you are my servant: I formed you; you are my servant; Israel, you will not be forgotten by me! 22 I have wiped your transgressions out like a cloud and your sins like mist. Return to me, for I have redeemed you!” 23 Sing for joy, heavens, for Yahweh has done it! Shout, depths of the earth! Break forth, mountains, in rejoicing, forest and every tree in it, for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob, and he will show his glory in Israel! 24 Thus says Yahweh, your redeemer, and he who formed you in the womb: “I am Yahweh, who made everything, who stretched out the heavens alone, who spread out the earth—who was with me?— 25 who frustrates the signs of oracle priests and makes a fool of diviners, who drives the wise men back and makes their knowledge foolish, 26 who keeps the word of his servant and carries out the plan of his messengers, who says of Jerusalem, ‘It shall be inhabited,’ and of the cities of Judah, ‘They shall be rebuilt, and I will restore its ruins’; 27 who says to the deep, ‘Dry up! And I will cause your rivers to dry up’; 28 who says of Cyrus, ‘My shepherd,’ and he shall carry out all my wishes; and saying of Jerusalem, ‘It shall be rebuilt,’ and the temple, ‘It shall be founded.’ ” ",Isaiah 43-44,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-43-44-54979/direct-download/tbd20090507.mp3
Isaiah,"1 Thus says Yahweh to his anointed one, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped to subjugate nations before him, and I uncover the loins of kings to open doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut: 2 “I myself will go before you, and I will level the mountains. I will break the doors of bronze and cut through the bars of iron. 3 And I will give you the treasures of darkness and treasures of secret places so that you may know that I am Yahweh, the one who calls you by your name, the God of Israel, 4 for the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen one. And I call you by your name; I give you a name of honor, though you do not know me. 5 I am Yahweh, and there is none besides me; besides me there is no god. I gird you though you do not know me, 6 so that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none besides me; I am Yahweh and there is none besides me. 7 I form light and I create darkness; I make peace and I create evil; I am Yahweh; I do all these things. 8 Trickle, O heavens, from above, and let clouds trickle with righteousness; let the earth open so that salvation may be fruitful, and let it cause righteousness to sprout along with it. I myself, Yahweh, have created it. 9 Woe to the one who strives with his maker, a potsherd among potsherds of earth! Does the clay say to the one who fashions it, ‘What are you making?’ and ‘Your work has no hands’? 10 Woe to the one who says to a father, ‘What you are begetting?’ or to a woman, ‘With what are you in labor?’ ” 11 Thus says Yahweh, the holy one of Israel, and its maker: “Ask me of the things to come about my children, and you command me about the work of my hands. 12 I myself made the earth, and I created humankind upon it. I, my hands, stretched out the heavens, and I commanded all their host. 13 I myself have stirred him up in righteousness, and I will make all his paths smooth. He himself shall build my city, and he shall set my exiles free, not for price or a gift,” says Yahweh of hosts. 14 Thus says Yahweh: “The acquisition of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush and the Sabeans, tall men, shall pass over to you; they shall be yours, and they shall walk behind you. They shall pass over in chains, and they shall bow down to you; they will pray to you: ‘Surely God is with you, and there is no other. Besides him there is no God.’ ” 15 Surely you are a God who keeps yourself hidden, God of Israel, the savior. 16 All of them are ashamed and indeed humiliated; the craftsmen of idols go together in insult. 17 Israel is saved by Yahweh with everlasting salvation; you shall not be ashamed, and you shall not be humiliated to all eternity. 18 For thus says Yahweh, who created the heavens, he is God, who formed the earth and who made it. He himself established it; he did not create it as emptiness— he formed it for inhabiting. “I am Yahweh and there is none besides me. 19 I have spoken not in secrecy, in a place, a land, of darkness, I have not said to the descendants of Jacob, ‘Seek me in vain!’ I, Yahweh, am speaking righteousness, declaring uprightness. 20 Assemble and come; draw near together, survivors of the nations! They do not know, those who carry their wooden idols and pray to a god who cannot save. 21 Declare and present your case, also let them consult together! Who made this known from former times, declared it from of old? Was it not I, Yahweh? And there is no other god besides me, a righteous God besides me, and no savior besides me. 22 Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God and there is none besides me. 23 I have sworn by myself; a word that shall not return has gone forth from my mouth in righteousness: ‘Every knee shall kneel down to me; every tongue shall swear.’ 24 ‘Only in Yahweh,’ one shall say to me, ‘are righteousness and strength.’ He shall come to him, and all those who were angry with him shall be ashamed. 25 In Yahweh all the offspring of Israel shall be in the right, and they shall boast.” 1 Bel bows down; Nebo is stooping. Their idols are on animals and on cattle; your cargo is carried as a burden on weary animals. 2 They stoop; they bow down together. They are not able to save the burden, but they themselves go in captivity. 3 “Listen to me, house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel who have been carried from the belly, who have been carried from the womb: 4 Even to your old age I am he; even to your advanced age I myself will support you. I myself have made you, and I myself will carry you, and I myself will support you, and I will save you. 5 To whom will you liken me, and count as equal, and compare with me, as though we were alike? 6 Those who lavish gold from the purse and weigh out silver in the balance scales; hire a goldsmith and he makes him a god; they bow down, indeed they bow in worship. 7 They carry it on their shoulder; they support it and they set it in its place, and it stands in position. It cannot be removed from its place; even when he cries out to it, it does not answer. It does not save him from his trouble. 8 Remember this and pluck up courage! Call to mind, you transgressors! 9 Remember the former things from a long time ago, for I am God and there is none besides me, God and there is none like me, 10 who from the beginning declares the end, and from before, things that have not been done, who says, ‘My plan shall stand,’ and, ‘I will accomplish all my wishes,’ 11 who calls a bird of prey from the east, the man of his plan from a country from afar. Indeed I have spoken; indeed I will bring it to being. I have formed it; indeed I will do it. 12 Listen to me, strong of heart, far from righteousness! 13 I bring my righteousness near; it is not far. And my salvation will not delay; and I will put salvation in Zion, for Israel my glory.” ",Isaiah 45-46,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-45-46-54980/direct-download/tbd20090508.mp3
Isaiah,"1 Come down and sit on the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon! Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of Chaldea! For they shall no longer call you tender and delicate. 2 Take the pair of mill stones and grind flour! Uncover your veil, strip off your skirt, uncover your thigh, pass through the rivers! 3 Your nakedness shall be exposed; indeed, your shame shall become visible. I will take vengeance and I will not spare a person. 4 Our redeemer, Yahweh of hosts is his name, the holy one of Israel. 5 Sit silently and go into the darkness, daughter of Chaldea, for they shall no longer call you mistress of kingdoms. 6 I was angry with my people; I profaned my inheritance, and I gave them into your hand. You did not give them mercy; on the aged you made your yoke very heavy. 7 And you said, “I shall be an eternal mistress forever!” You did not set these things upon your heart; you did not remember its end. 8 Therefore now hear this, luxuriant one who sits in security, who says in her heart, “I am, and besides me there is no one. I shall not sit as a widow, and I shall not know the loss of children.” 9 And these two shall come to you in a moment, in one day: the loss of children and widowhood shall come on you completely, in spite of your many sorceries, in spite of the power of your great enchantments. 10 And you felt secure in your wickedness; you said, “No one sees me.” Your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart, “I am, and besides me there is no one.” 11 And evil shall come upon you, you will not know; it will be on the lookout for her. And disaster shall fall upon you; you will not be able to avert it. And ruin shall come on you suddenly; you do not know. 12 Stand, now, in your enchantments, and in your many sorceries with which you have labored from your youth. Perhaps you may be able to benefit; perhaps you may scare away. 13 You struggle with your many consultations; let them stand, now, and save you— those who see the stars, divide the celestial sphere, who inform by new moons— from those things that are coming upon you. 14 Look! They are like stubble; the fire burns them completely. They cannot deliver themselves from the power of the flame; there is no coal for warming oneself, no fire before which to sit. 15 So are to you those with whom you have labored, your traders from your youth. They wander, each to his side; there is no one who can save you. 1 Hear this, house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel and came out from the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of Yahweh, and invoke the God of Israel, but not in truth and not in righteousness. 2 For they call themselves after the holy city, and they lean on the God of Israel— Yahweh of hosts is his name. 3 “I declared the former things from of old, and they went out from my mouth. And I announced them suddenly; I acted, and they came to pass, 4 because I know that you are obstinate, and your neck an iron sinew, and your forehead bronze. 5 And I declared them to you from of old; I announced them to you before they came to pass so that you would not say, ‘My idol did them, and my image and my cast image commanded them.’ 6 You have heard; see it all. And will you not declare it? I announce new things to you from this time and hidden things that you have not known. 7 Now they are created, and not from of old, and before today, and you have not heard them so that you could not say, “Look! I knew them.” 8 Neither have you heard, nor have you known, nor from of old has your ear been opened. For I knew you would deal treacherously, very treacherously, and you are called a rebel from the womb. 9 For the sake of my name I refrain from my anger, and for my praise I restrain it for you so as not to cut you off. 10 Look! I have refined you, but not like silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of misery. 11 For my own sake, for my own sake I do it; for why should it be defiled? And I will not give my glory to another.” 12 “Listen to me, Jacob, and Israel, whom I called: I am he. I am the first; also I am the last. 13 Indeed, my hand founded the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I summon them, they stand in position together. 14 Assemble, all of you, and hear! Who among them declared these things? Yahweh loves him; he shall perform his wish against Babylon and his arm against the Chaldeans. 15 I, I myself, I have spoken! Indeed, I have called him. I have brought him, and he will be successful in his way. 16 Draw near to me; hear this! I have not spoken in secrecy from the beginning; from the time it came to be, there I have been; And now the Lord Yahweh has sent me and his Spirit.” 17 Thus says Yahweh, your redeemer, the holy one of Israel: “I am Yahweh your God, who teaches you to profit, leads you in the way you should go. 18 O that you had listened attentively to my commandments! Then your prosperity would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea. 19 And your offspring would have been like the sand, and the descendants of your body like its grains. It would not be cut off, and its name would not be destroyed from my presence.” 20 Go out from Babylon! Flee from Chaldea! Proclaim it with a shout of rejoicing; proclaim this! Send it forth to the end of the earth; say, “Yahweh has redeemed his servant Jacob!” 21 And when he led them through the deserts, they were not thirsty; he made water flow from the rock for them, and he split the rock, and the water gushed out. 22 “There is no peace,” says Yahweh, “for the wicked.” ",Isaiah 47-48,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-47-48-54981/direct-download/tbd20090511.mp3
Isaiah,"1 Listen to me, coastlands, and listen attentively, peoples from far away! Yahweh called me from the womb; from the body of my mother he made my name known. 2 And he made my mouth like a sharp sword; he hid me in the shadow of his hand, and he made me like an sharpened arrow; he hid me in his quiver. 3 And he said to me, “You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will show my glory.” 4 But I myself said, “I have labored in vain; I have used up my strength for nothing and vanity! Nevertheless, my justice is with Yahweh, and my reward is with my God.” 5 And now Yahweh says, who formed me from the womb as a servant for him, to bring Jacob back to him, and that Israel might not be gathered, for I am honored in the eyes of Yahweh, and my God has become my strength. 6 And he says, “It is trivial for you to be a servant for me, to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the preserved of Israel. I will give you as a light to the nations, to be my salvation to the end of the earth.” 7 Thus says Yahweh, the redeemer of Israel, his holy one, to the one who despises life, to the one who abhors the nation, to the slave of rulers: “Kings shall see and stand up; princes, and they shall bow down, for the sake of Yahweh, who is faithful, the holy one of Israel, and he has chosen you.” 8 Thus says Yahweh: “I have answered you in a time of favor, and helped you on a day of salvation, and watched over you, and given you as a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to give the desolate hereditary property as an inheritance, 9 saying to the prisoners, “Come out!” to those who are in darkness, “Show yourselves!” they shall feed along the ways, and their pasturage shall be on all the barren heights. 10 They shall not be hungry or thirsty, and heat and sun shall not strike them, for he who takes pity on them will lead them, and he will guide them to springs of water. 11 And I will make all my mountains like a road, and my highways shall lead up. 12 Look! These shall come from afar, And look! These from the north and from the west and these from the land of Sinim.” 13 Sing for joy, heavens, and rejoice, earth! Mountains must break forth in rejoicing! For Yahweh has comforted his people, and he will take pity on his afflicted ones. 14 But Zion said, “Yahweh has forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me!” 15 Can a woman forget her suckling, refrain from having compassion on the child of her womb? Indeed, these may forget, but I, I will not forget you! 16 Look, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me. 17 Your children hasten; your destroyers and those who laid you waste depart from you. 18 Lift your eyes up all around and see; all of them gather; they come to you. As surely as I live, declares Yahweh, surely you shall put on all of them like an ornament, and you shall bind them on like a bride. 19 Surely your sites of ruins and desolate places and land of ruins, surely now you will be too cramped for your inhabitants, and those who engulfed you will be far away. 20 Yet the children born when you were bereaved will say in your hearing, “The place is too cramped for me; make room for me so that I can dwell.” 21 Then you will say in your heart, “Who has borne me these?” And, “I was bereaved and barren, exiled and thrust away; so who raised these? Look at me! I was left alone; where have these come from?” 22 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! I will lift my hand up to the nations, and I will raise my signal to the peoples, and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders. 23 And kings shall be your guardians, and their queens your nurses. They shall bow down, faces to the ground, to you, and they will lick up the dust of your feet. Then you will know that I am Yahweh; those who await me shall not be ashamed. 24 Can war-booty be taken from the mighty? or can a captive of a righteous person be rescued? 25 But thus says Yahweh: “Indeed a captive of the mighty shall be taken, and the war-booty of the tyrant shall be rescued, for I myself will dispute with your opponent, and I myself will save your children. 26 And I will feed your oppressors their own flesh, and they shall be drunk with their blood as with wine. Then all flesh shall know that I am Yahweh, your savior and redeemer, the strong one of Jacob.” 1 Thus says Yahweh: “Where is this divorce document of your mother’s divorce, with which I dismissed her? or to whom of my creditors did I sell you? Look! you were sold because of your sin, and your mother was dismissed because of your transgressions. 2 Why was there no man when I came, no one who answered when I called? Do I lack the strength to save? Or is there no power in me to deliver? Look! by my rebuke I dry up the sea; I make the rivers a desert; their fish stink because there is no water, and they die because of thirst. 3 I clothe the heavens with darkness, and I make their covering sackcloth.” 4 The Lord Yahweh has given me the tongue of a pupil, to know how to help the weary with a word.

He awakens morning by morning, awakens an ear for me to listen as do the pupils. 5 The Lord Yahweh has opened an ear for me, and I, I was not rebellious. I did not turn backwards; 6 I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard; I did not hide my face from insults and spittle. 7 And the Lord Yahweh helps me, therefore I have not been put to shame; therefore I have set my face like flint. And I know that I shall not be ashamed; 8 he who obtains rights for me is near. Who will contend with me? Let us stand together. Who is the master of my judgment? Let him approach me. 9 Look! The Lord Yahweh helps me. Who is the one who will declare me guilty? Look! All of them will be worn out like a garment; the moth will eat them. 10 Who among you is in fear of Yahweh, obeys the voice of his servant? Who walks in darkness and has no light, trusts in the name of Yahweh and depends on his God? 11 Look! All of you are kindlers of fire, who gird yourselves with flaming arrows. Walk in the light of your fire, and among the flaming arrows you have kindled! You shall have this from my hand: you shall lie down in a place of torment. 1 “Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, who seek Yahweh. Look to the rock from which you were hewn, and to the excavation of the pit from which you were quarried. 2 Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah; she brought you forth. For I called him alone, but I blessed him and made him numerous.” 3 For Yahweh will comfort Zion; he will comfort all its sites of ruins. And he will make its wilderness like Eden, and its desert like the garden of Yahweh. Joy and gladness will be found in it, thanksgiving and the sound of song. 4 “Listen attentively to me, my people, and my nation, listen to me! For a teaching will go out from me, and I will cause my justice to rest for a light to the peoples. 5 My righteousness is near; my salvation has gone out, and my arms will judge the peoples. The coastlands wait for me, and for my arm they wait. 6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens and look to the earth beneath, for the heavens will be torn to pieces like smoke, and the earth will be worn out like a garment, and those who inhabit her will die like gnats. But my salvation will be forever, and my righteousness will not be broken to pieces. 7 Listen to me, you who know righteousness, people who have my teaching in their heart; you must not fear the reproach of men, or be terrified because of their abuse. 8 For a moth will eat them like garments; a moth will devour them like wool, but my righteousness will be forever, and my salvation for generation after generation.” 9 Awake! Awake; put on strength, O arm of Yahweh! Awake as in days of long ago, the generations of a long time back! Are you not the one who cut Rahab in pieces, the one who pierced the sea-dragon? 10 Are you not the one who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, the one who made the depths of the sea a way for those who are redeemed to cross over? 11 So the redeemed ones of Yahweh shall return, and they shall come to Zion with singing, and everlasting joy shall be on their heads. Joy and gladness shall appear; sorrow and sighing shall flee away! 12 “I, I am he who comforts you; who are you that you are afraid of man? He dies! And of the son of humankind? He is sacrificed as grass! 13 And you have forgotten Yahweh, your maker, who stretched out the heavens, and founded the earth. And you tremble continually, all day, because of the wrath of the oppressor when he takes aim to destroy. But where is the wrath of the oppressor? 14 The fettered one shall make haste to be freed. And he shall not die in the pit, and he shall not lack his bread. 15 For I am Yahweh, your God, who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar; Yahweh of hosts is his name. 16 And I have put my words in your mouth, and I have covered you in the shadow of my hand, to plant the heavens and to found the earth, saying to Zion, ‘You are my people.’ ” 17 Rouse yourself! Rouse yourself! Stand up, Jerusalem, who have drunk from the hand of Yahweh the cup of his wrath; you have drunk the goblet, the cup of staggering; you have drained it out. 18 There is no one who guides her among all the children she has borne, and there is no one who grasps her by the hand among all the children she raised. 19 Two things here have happened to you—who will show sympathy for you?— devastation and destruction, famine and sword—who will comfort you? 20 Your children have fainted; they lie at the head of all the streets, like an antelope in a snare, those who are full of the wrath of Yahweh, the rebuke of your God. 21 Therefore hear now this afflicted one and drunken one but not from wine. 22 Thus says your Lord, Yahweh, and your God pleads the cause of his people: “Look! I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering. You shall not continue to drink the goblet, the cup of my wrath, any longer. 23 And I will put it in the hand of your tormenters, who have said to you, ‘Bow down that we may pass over you!’ And you have made your back like the ground, and like the street for those who pass over you.” ",Isaiah 50-51,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-50-51-54983/direct-download/tbd20090513.mp3
Isaiah,"1 Awake! Awake; put on your strength, Zion! Put on the garments of your beauty, Jerusalem, holy city! For the uncircumcised and the unclean shall not continue to enter you any longer. 2 Shake yourself free from the dust! Rise up; sit, Jerusalem! Free yourselves from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion! 3 For thus says Yahweh: “You were sold for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money.” 4 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “My people went down to Egypt in the beginning, to dwell as aliens there, and Assyria oppressed him without cause. 5 And now what do I have here?”declares Yahweh, “for my people is taken without cause. Its rulers howl,” declares Yahweh—“and my name is reviled continually, all day. 6 Therefore my people shall know my name, therefore in that day, that I am the one who speaks. Here am I.” 7 How delightful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who announces peace, who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, “Your God reigns as a king.” 8 The voices of your watchmen! They lift up their voices; together they sing for joy; for they clearly see Yahweh’s return to Zion. 9 Break forth, sing for joy together, ruins of Jerusalem, for Yahweh has comforted his people; he has redeemed Jerusalem. 10 Yahweh has bared his holy arm to the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God. 11 Depart, depart, go out from there! You must not touch any unclean thing. Go out from the midst of it, keep clean, you who carry the vessels of Yahweh. 12 For you shall not go out in haste, and you shall not go in flight, for Yahweh is going before you, and your rear guard is the God of Israel. 13 Look, my servant shall achieve success; he shall be exalted, and he shall be lifted up, and he shall be very high. 14 Just as many were appalled at you— such was his appearance beyond human disfigurement, and his form beyond the sons of mankind— 15 so he shall sprinkle many nations; because of him, kings shall shut their mouths. For they shall see what has not been told them, and they shall consider with full attention what they have not heard. 1 Who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?

Isaiah,"1 Who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed? 2 For he went up like a shoot before him, and like a root from dry ground. He had no form and no majesty that we should see him, and no appearance that we should take pleasure in him. 3 He was despised and rejected by men, a man of suffering, and acquainted with sickness, and like one from whom others hide their faces, he was despised, and we did not hold him in high regard. 4 However, he was the one who lifted up our sicknesses, and he carried our pain, yet we ourselves assumed him stricken, struck down by God and afflicted. 5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon him, and by his wounds we were healed. 6 All of us have wandered about like sheep; we each have turned to his own way; and Yahweh let fall on him the iniquity of us all.

Isaiah,"5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon him, and by his wounds we were healed. 6 All of us have wandered about like sheep; we each have turned to his own way; and Yahweh let fall on him the iniquity of us all. 7 He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, and like a sheep is dumb before its shearers, so he did not open his mouth. 8 He was taken by restraint of justice, and who concerned himself with his generation? For he was cut off from the land of the living; he received a blow because of the transgression of my people. 9 He made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth. 10 Yet Yahweh was pleased to crush him; he made him sick. If she places his life a guilt offering, he will see offspring. He will prolong days, and the will of Yahweh will succeed in his hand. 11 From the trouble of his life he will see; he will be satisfied. In his knowledge, the righteous one, my servant, shall declare many righteous, and he is the one who will bear their iniquities. 12 Therefore, I will divide to him a portion among the many, and with the strong ones he will divide bounty, because he poured his life out to death and was counted with the transgressors; and he was the one who bore the sin of many and will intercede for the transgressors. 1 “Sing for joy, barren woman; who has not borne! Burst forth into rejoicing and rejoice, she who has not been in labor! For the children of the desolate woman are more than the children of the married woman,” says Yahweh. 2 “Enlarge the site of your tent, and let them stretch out the tent curtains of your dwelling place. You must not spare; make your tent cords long and strengthen your pegs, 3 for you will spread out to the right and to the left. And your descendants will be heir to the nations, and they will inhabit desolate towns. 4 You must not fear, for you will not be ashamed, and you must not be confounded, for you will not feel abashed, for you will forget the shame of your youth, and you will no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood. 5 For your husband is your maker, his name is Yahweh of hosts; and your redeemer is the holy one of Israel, he is called the God of all of the earth. 6 For Yahweh has called you like a wife forsaken and hurt of spirit, like the wife of childhood when she is rejected, says your God. 7 I abandoned you for a short moment, but I will gather you with great compassion. 8 I hid my face from you for a moment, in the flowing of anger, but I will have compassion on you with everlasting faithfulness” says your redeemer, Yahweh. 9 “For this is like the waters of Noah to me, when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again pass over the earth, so I swore that I would not be angry at you and rebuke you. 10 For the mountains may depart, and the hills may sway, but my faithfulness shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not sway,” says Yahweh, who has compassion on you, 11 “O afflicted one, driven away, who is not consoled. Look! I am about to set your stones in hard mortar, and I will lay your foundation with sapphires. 12 And I will make your battlements of ruby, and your gates of stones of beryl, and all your wall of precious stones. 13 And all your children shall be pupils of Yahweh, and the peace of your children shall be great. 14 In righteousness you shall be established. Be far from oppression, for you shall not fear, and from terror, for it shall not come near you. 15 If indeed one attacks, it is not from me; whoever attacks you shall fall because of you. 16 Look! I myself have created the craftsman who blows the fire of coals, and who produces a weapon for his work; also I myself have created the destroyer to destroy. 17 Every weapon formed against you shall not succeed, and you shall declare guilty every tongue that rises against you for judgment. This is the inheritance of the servants of Yahweh, and their legal right from me,” declares Yahweh.

Isaiah,"1 “Ho! Everyone thirsty, come to the waters! And whoever has no money, come, buy and eat, and come, buy without money, wine and milk without price! 2 Why do you weigh out money for what is not food, and your labor for what cannot satisfy? Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good, and let your soul take pleasure in rich food. 3 Extend your ear, and come to me! Listen so that your soul may live, and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, the enduring proofs of the mercies shown to David. 4 Look! I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and a commander for the peoples. 5 Look! You shall call a nation that you do not know, and a nation that does not know you shall run to you, because of Yahweh your God, and the holy one of Israel, for he has glorified you.” 6 Seek Yahweh while he lets himself be found; call him while he is near. 7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of sin his thoughts. And let him return to Yahweh, that he may take pity on him, and to our God, for he will forgive manifold. 8 “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, and your ways are not my ways,” declares Yahweh. 9 “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. 10 For just as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and they do not return there except they have watered the earth thoroughly and cause it to bring forth and sprout, and give seed to the sower and bread to the eater, 11 so shall be my word that goes out from my mouth. It shall not return to me without success, but shall accomplish what I desire and be successful in the thing for which I sent it. 12 For you shall go out in joy, and you shall be led in peace. The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you, rejoicing and all the trees of the field shall clap hands. 13 Instead of the thorn bush, the juniper shall go up; instead of the brier, the myrtle shall go up, and it shall serve as a memorial to Yahweh, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.” ",Isaiah 55,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-55-54987/direct-download/tbd20090519.mp3
Isaiah,"1 Thus says Yahweh: “Observe justice and do righteousness, for my salvation is close to coming, and my justice to being revealed. 2 Happy is the man who does this, and the son of humankind who keeps hold of it, who keeps the Sabbath so as not to profane it, and who keeps his hand from doing any evil.” 3 And do not let the foreigner who joins himself to Yahweh say, “Surely Yahweh will separate me from his people.” And do not let the eunuch say, “Look! I am a dry tree!” 4 For thus says Yahweh, “To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, and choose that in which I delight, and who keep hold of my covenant. 5 And I will give them a monument and a name in my house and within my walls, better than sons and daughters; I will give him an everlasting name that shall not be cut off. 6 And the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh to serve him and to love the name of Yahweh, to become his servants, every one who keeps the Sabbath, so as not to profane it, and those who keep hold of my covenant, 7 I will bring them to my holy mountain; I will make them merry in my house of prayer. their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar, for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples,” 8 declares the Lord Yahweh, who gathers the scattered ones of Israel (still I will gather to him, to his gathered ones). 9 All wild animals in the field, come, to devour, all wild animals in the forest! 10 His watchmen are blind, none of them know. They are all dumb dogs; they are unable to bark, panting, lying down, loving to slumber. 11 And the dogs have a greedy appetite; they are never satisfied. And they are the shepherds! They do not have understanding. They all turn to their own way, each one for his own gain, every one of them. 12 “Come, let me take wine, and let us carouse with intoxicating drink, and tomorrow will be like today, very great indeed.” 1 The righteous one perishes, and there is no one who takes it to heart. And men of faithfulness are gathered, while there is no one who understands, for the righteous is gathered from the presence of wickedness. 2 he enters into peace; they will rest on their beds, walking straight ahead of him. 3 “But you, come near here, you children of a soothsayer, offspring of an adulterer and she who commits fornication. 4 At whom do you make fun? At whom do you open your mouth and stick out your tongue?

Isaiah,"5 who burn with lust among the oaks, under every leafy tree, who slaughter children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks? 6 Your portion is among the smooth stones of the valley; they, they are your lot; indeed, to them you have poured out a drink offering, you have brought a food offering. Shall I relent concerning these things? 7 You have set your bed upon a high and lofty mountain; indeed, you went up there to slaughter sacrifice. 8 And you have set your symbol behind the door and the doorpost; for you depart from me, and you go up; you make your bed wide, and you make a deal with them, you have loved their bed; you have seen their genitals. 9 And you climbed down to the king with oil, and you made your perfumes numerous, and you sent your envoys far away, and you sent down deep to Sheol. 10 You grow weary by the greatness of your way, but you did not say, ‘Despairing!’ You found the renewal of your strength, therefore you do not grow weak. 11 And of whom were you afraid and feared, that you deceived and did not remember me? Did you not place it on your heart? Have I not been silent, even from long ago, and so you do not fear me? 12 I myself will declare your righteousness and your works, but they will not benefit you. 13 When you cry, let your collection deliver you, and the wind will carry all of them away; a breath will take them away. But he who takes refuge in me shall take possession of the land, and he shall inherit my holy mountain.” 14 And one shall say, “Build up, build up! Clear the way! Remove the obstacles from the way of my people!” 15 For thus says the high and lofty one who resides forever, and whose name is holy: “I reside in a high and holy place, and with the contrite and humble of spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite. 16 For I will not attack forever, and I will not be angry forever, for the spirit will grow faint before me, and the breaths that I myself I have made. 17 I was angry because of his sin of gain, and I struck him; I hid and I was angry, but he walked apostate, in the ways of his heart. 18 I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; and I will lead him and give him and his mourners comfort as a recompense, 19 creating fruit of lips. Peace, peace to the far and near,” says Yahweh, “and I will heal him. 20 But the wicked are like the churning sea, that is not able to keep quiet, and its waters toss up mire and mud. 21 There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.” 1 “Call with the throat; you must not keep back! lift up your voice like a trumpet, and declare to my people their rebellion, and to the house of Jacob their sins. 2 Yet they seek me day by day, and they desire the knowledge of my ways like a nation that practiced righteousness, and had not forsaken the judgment of its God; they ask me for righteous judgments, they desire the closeness of God. 3 ‘Why do we fast, and you do not see it?

Isaiah,"4 Look! You fast to quarrel and strife, and to strike with a wicked fist. You shall not fast as you do today, to make your voice heard on the height. 5 Is the fast I choose like this, a day for humankind to humiliate himself? To bow his head like a reed, and make his bed on sackcloth and ashes; you call this a fast and a day of pleasure to Yahweh? 6 Is this not the fast I choose: to release the bonds of injustice, to untie the ropes of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and tear every yoke to pieces? 7 Is it not to break your bread for the hungry? You must bring home the poor, the homeless. When you see the naked, you must cover him, and you must not hide yourself from your relatives. 8 Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall grow quickly. And your salvation shall go before you; the glory of Yahweh will be your rear guard. 9 Then you shall call, and Yahweh himself will answer. You shall cry for help, and he will say, ‘Here I am!’ If you remove from among you the yoke, the finger-pointing and evil speech, 10 if you offer your soul to the hungry, and you satisfy the appetite of the afflicted, then your light shall rise in the darkness, and your darkness will be like noon. 11 And Yahweh will lead you continually, and satisfy your soul in a barren land, and he will strengthen your bones, and you shall be like a well-watered garden, and like a spring of water whose water does not fail. 12 And they shall rebuild ancient ruins from you; you shall erect the foundations of many generations, and you shall be called the bricklayer of the breach, the restorer of paths to live in. 13 If you hold your foot back from the Sabbath, from doing your affairs on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a pleasure, the holy day of Yahweh honorable, if you honor him more than doing your ways, than finding your affairs and speaking a word, 14 then you shall take your pleasure in Yahweh, and I will make you ride upon the heights of the earth, and I will feed you the heritage of Jacob your ancestor, for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.” 1 Look! The hand of Yahweh is not too short to save, and his ear is not too dull to hear. 2 Rather, your iniquities have been barriers between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you, from hearing. 3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity. Your lips have spoken lies, your tongue speaks wickedness. 4 There is nobody who pleads with justice, and there is nobody who judges with honesty. They rely on nothing and speak vanity. They conceive trouble and beget iniquity; 5 they hatch viper eggs, and they weave a spider web. One who eats their eggs dies, and that which is pressed is hatched as a serpent. 6 Their webs cannot become clothing, and they cannot cover themselves with their works. Their works are works of iniquity, and deeds of violence are in their hands. 7 Their feet run to evil, and they hasten to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; devastation and destruction are in their highways. 8 They do not know the way of peace, and there is no justice in their firm paths. They have made their paths crooked for themselves; everyone who walks in it knows no peace. 9 Therefore justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We wait for light, but look! there is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in darkness. 10 We grope like the blind along a wall, and we grope as without eyes. We stumble at noon as in the twilight; among the strong we are like the dead. 11 We all groan like bears, and we coo mutteringly like doves. We wait for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us. 12 For our transgressions are numerous before you, and our sins testify against us. Indeed, our transgressions are with us, and we know our iniquities: 13 transgressing and denying Yahweh, and turning away from following our God; speaking oppression and falsehood, conceiving and uttering words of deception from the heart. 14 And justice is pushed back, and righteousness stands afar; for truth stumbles in the public square, and straightforwardness is unable to enter, 15 and truth is missing, and he who turns aside from evil is plundered. And Yahweh saw, and it was displeasing in his eyes that there was no justice 16 And he saw that there was no man, and he was appalled that there was no one who intercedes, so his arm came to assist him, and his righteousness was what sustained him. 17 And he put on righteousness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head, and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and he wrapped himself in zeal as in a robe. 18 According to deeds, so he will repay; wrath to his enemies, requital to those who are his enemies. He will repay requital to the coastlands. 19 So they shall fear the name of Yahweh from the west, and his glory from the sunrise, for he will come like a narrow stream; the wind of Yahweh drives it on. 20 “And a redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn away from transgression,” declares Yahweh. 21 “And as for me, this is my covenant with them, says Yahweh: my spirit that is upon you, and my words that I have placed in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, or from the mouths of your children, or from the mouths of your children’s children,” says Yahweh, “from now on and forever.” ",Isaiah 58:4-59:21,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-584-5921-54990/direct-download/tbd20090522.mp3

And I will appoint peace as your overseer, and righteousness as your ruling body. 18 Violence shall no longer be heard in your land; devastation or destruction on your borders. And you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates, Praise. 19 The sun shall no longer be your light by day, and for bright light the moon shall not give you light, but Yahweh will be your everlasting light, and your God your glory. 20 Your sun shall no longer go down, and your moon shall not wane, for Yahweh himself will be your everlasting light, and your days of mourning shall come to an end. 21 And all your people shall be righteous; they shall take possession of the land forever, the shoot of his planting, the work of my hands, to show my glory. 22 The small one shall become a tribe, and the smallest one a mighty nation. I am Yahweh; I will hasten it in its time.” 1 The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is upon me, because Yahweh has anointed me, he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim release to the captives and liberation to those who are bound, 2 to proclaim the year of Yahweh’s favor, and our God’s day of vengeance, to comfort all those in mourning, ",Isaiah 60:1-61:2,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-601-612-54991/direct-download/tbd20090525.mp3

For he has clothed me with garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns himself with a head wrap like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewelry. 11 For as the earth produces its sprout, and as a garden makes its plants sprout, so the Lord Yahweh will make righteousness sprout, and praise before all the nations. 1 For the sake of Zion I will not be silent, and for the sake of Jerusalem I will not maintain a quiet attitude, until her righteousness goes out like the bright light, and her salvation burns like a torch. 2 And the nations shall see your righteousness, and all the kings your glory, and you will be called a new name that the mouth of Yahweh will designate. 3 And you shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh, and a headband of royalty in the hand of your God. 4 It shall no longer be said of you, “Forsaken,” and it shall no longer be said of your land, “Desolation!” but you will be called “My Delight Is In Her,” and your land, “Married,” for Yahweh delights in you, and your land shall be married. 5 For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you, and as is the joy of the bridegroom over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you. 6 I have appointed watchmen upon your walls, Jerusalem; all day and all night they shall never be silent. You who profess Yahweh have no rest. 7 And you must not give him rest until he establishes, and until he makes Jerusalem an object of praise in the earth. 8 Yahweh has sworn by his right hand, and by his mighty arm, “Surely I will never again give your grain as food to your enemies, and surely foreigners shall not drink your new wine at which you have labored.” 9 But those who gather it shall eat it, and they shall praise Yahweh, and those who gather it shall drink it in my holy courts. 10 Pass through, pass through the gates! Make the way clear for the people! Pile up, pile up the highway; clear it of stones! Lift up an ensign over the peoples! 11 Look! Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth: Say to daughter Zion, “Look, your salvation is coming! Look, his reward is with him, and his reward before him. 12 And they shall call them “The Holy People, The Redeemed Of Yahweh,” and you shall be called “Sought After, A City Not Forsaken.” ",Isaiah 61:2-62:12,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-612-6212-54992/direct-download/tbd20090526.mp3
Isaiah,"1 Who is this, coming from Edom, from Bozrah in bright red garments? Who is this honored in his garment, lying down in his great strength? “It is I, speaking in justice, mighty to save!” 2 Why are your garments red, and your garments like he who treads in the winepress? 3 “I have trodden the winepress alone, and there was no man from the peoples with me. And I trod them in my anger, and I trampled them in my wrath, and spattered their juice on my garments, and stained all my clothing, 4 for the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my blood-vengeance has come! 5 And I looked, but there was no helper, and I was appalled, but there was no one who sustains, so my arm came to assist me, and my wrath was what sustained me. 6 And I trampled peoples in my anger, and I made them drunk in my wrath, and I brought their juice down to the earth.” 7 I will mention the loyal love of Yahweh, the praises of Yahweh, according to all that Yahweh has done for us, and the greatness of goodness to the house of Israel that he has done to them according to his mercy and the abundance of his loyal love. 8 And he said, “Surely my people are children; they will not break faith.” And he became a Savior to them. 9 In all their distress, there was no distress, and the messenger of his presence saved them, in his love and compassion he himself redeemed them, and he lifted them up, and he supported them all the days of old. 10 But they were the ones who rebelled, and they grieved his Holy Spirit, so he became an enemy to them; he himself fought against them. 11 Then his people remembered the days of old, of Moses. Where is the one who led up them from the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is the one who puts his Holy Spirit inside him, 12 who made his magnificent arm move at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them, to make an everlasting name for himself, 13 who led them through the depths? They did not stumble like a horse in the desert; 14 like cattle in the valley that goes down, the Spirit of Yahweh gave him rest, so you lead your people to make a magnificent name for yourself. 15 Look from heaven, and see from the lofty residence of your holiness and glory. Where are your zeal and strength? Your compassion and mercy to me hold themselves back. 16 For you are our father, although Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us. You, Yahweh are our father, Our Redeemer from of old is your name. 17 Why do you make us wander from your ways, Yahweh? You harden our heart so that we do not fear you. Turn back for the sake of your servants, the tribes of your inheritance. 18 Your holy people took possession for a little while; our adversaries have trampled down your sanctuary. 19 We have been since antiquity; you did not rule them; they were not called by your name.

Isaiah,"1 Would that you would tear the heavens and come down; the mountains would quake before you, 2 as fire kindles brushwood, the fire causes water to boil, to make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations might tremble from your presence. 3 When you did terrible deeds which we did not expect, you came down; the mountains quaked because of your presence. 4 And since ancient times they have not heard, have not listened, no eye has seen a God except you; he acts for the one who waits for him. 5 You meet with the one who rejoices, one who does righteousness. In your ways they remember you. Look! You were angry and we sinned against them in ancient times and we were saved. 6 And we all have become like the unclean, and all our deeds of justice like a menstrual cloth, And we all wither like a leaf, and our iniquities take us away like the wind. 7 And there is no one who calls on your name, who pulls himself up to keep hold of you, for you have hidden your face from us, and melted us into the hand of our iniquity. 8 Yet now Yahweh, you are our father; we are the clay and you are our potter, and we all are the work of your hand. 9 You must not be exceedingly angry, Yahweh, and you must not remember iniquity forever! Look! Behold, now! We all are your people! 10 Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 11 Our holy and beautiful temple, where our ancestors praised you has been burned by fire, and all our precious objects have become ruins. 12 Will you control yourself because of these, Yahweh? Will you be silent? And will you oppress us exceedingly? 1 “I let myself be sought by those who did not ask; I let myself be found by those who did not seek me. I said, ‘Here I am; here I am!’ to a nation that did not call on my name; 2 I spread out my hands all day to a stubborn people, those who walk after their thoughts in the way that is not good, ",Isaiah 64:1-65:2,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-641-652-54994/direct-download/tbd20090528.mp3
Isaiah,"3 the people who provoke me to anger continually to my face, slaughtering for sacrifices in the garden, and making smoke offerings on bricks, 4 who sit in graves and spend the night in secret places, who eat the flesh of swine with a fragment of impurity in their vessels, 5 who say, “Keep to yourself! You must not come near me, for I am too holy for you!” These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire burning all day. 6 Look! It is written before me: I will not be silent, but I will repay; and I will repay in the fold of their garment 7 your iniquities and the iniquities of your ancestors together, says Yahweh, because they made smoke offerings on the mountains and they taunted me on the hills, I will measure their punishment from the beginning into the fold of their garment.” 8 Thus says Yahweh: “Just as the new wine is found in the cluster, and they say ‘You must not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it,’ so I will do for the sake of my servants by not destroying everyone. 9 And I will bring descendants out from Jacob, and a people from Judah to take possession of my mountain, and my chosen ones shall inherit it, and my servants shall settle there. 10 And Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks, and the valley of Achor a resting place for herds for my people who have sought me. 11 But you who forsake Yahweh, forgetting my holy mountain, who set a table for Fortune, and who pour out a jug of mixed wine for Destiny, 12 and I will remit you to the sword, and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter, because I called, but you did not answer; I spoke, but you did not listen, but you did the evil in my eyes, and you chose that in which I do not delight.” 13 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Look! My servants shall eat but you, you shall be hungry. Look! My servants shall drink but you, you shall be thirsty. Look! My servants shall rejoice but you, you shall be ashamed. 14 Look! My servants shall shout for joy of heart, but you, you shall cry out for pain and howl for sadness. 15 And you shall leave your name to my chosen ones as a curse, and the Lord Yahweh will kill you, and he will give his servants another name. 16 Whoever blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of trustworthiness, and the one who swears an oath in the land shall swear by the God of trustworthiness, because the former troubles are forgotten, and they are hidden from my eyes. 17 For look! I am about to create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered, and they shall not come to mind. 18 But rejoice and shout in exultation forever and ever over what I am about to create! For look! I am about to create Jerusalem as a source of rejoicing, and her people as a source of joy. 19 And I will shout in exultation over Jerusalem, and I will rejoice over my people, and the sound of weeping shall no longer be heard in it, or the sound of a cry for help. 20 There will no longer be a nursing infant who lives only a few days, or an old man who does not fill his days, for the boy will die a hundred years old, and the one who fails to reach a hundred years will be considered accursed. 21 And they shall build houses and inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 22 They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat. For the days of my people shall be like the days of a tree, and my chosen ones shall enjoy the work of their hands. 23 They shall not labor for nothing, and they shall not give birth to horror, for they shall be offspring blessed by Yahweh, and their descendants with them. 24 And this will happen: before they call, I myself will answer; while still they are speaking, I myself will hear. 25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed like one, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox, but dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall do no evil, and they shall not destroy on all my holy mountain,” says Yahweh. 1 Thus says Yahweh: “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is the footstool for my feet. Where is this house that you would build for me? And where is this resting place for me? 2 And my hand has made all these things, and all these came to be,” declares Yahweh, “but I look to this one: to the humble and the contrite of spirit and the one frightened at my word. 3 The one who slaughters a bull strikes a man; the one who slaughters a lamb for sacrifice breaks the neck of a dog. The one who offers an offering, the blood of swine; the one who offers frankincense blesses an idol. Indeed, they themselves have chosen their ways, and their soul delights in their abhorrence. 4 Indeed, I myself I will choose their ill treatment, and I will bring them objects of their dread, because I called, and no one answered; I spoke and they did not listen, but they did the evil in my eyes, and they chose that in which I do not delight.” 5 Hear the word of Yahweh, you who are frightened at his word: Your brothers who hate you, who exclude you for my name’s sake have said, “Let Yahweh be honored so that we may see your joy!” But they themselves shall be ashamed. 6 A voice, an uproar from the city! A voice from the temple! The voice of Yahweh paying back his enemies! 7 Before she was in labor she gave birth; before labor pains came to her, she gave birth to a son. 8 Who has heard anything like this? Who has seen anything like these things? Can a land be born in one day? Or can a nation be born in a moment? Yet when she was in labor, Zion indeed gave birth to her children. 9 Shall I myself I break open and not deliver?” says Yahweh, “or I who delivers lock up the womb?” says your God. 10 “Rejoice with Jerusalem and shout in exultation with her, all those who love her! Rejoice with her in joy, all those who mourn over her, 11 so that you may suck and be satisfied from her consoling breast, so that you may drink deeply and refresh yourselves from her heavy breast.” 12 For thus says Yahweh: “Look! I am about to spread prosperity out to her like a river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream, and you shall suck and be carried on the hip; and you shall be played with on the knees. 13 As a man whose mother comforts him, so I myself will comfort you, and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem. 14 And you shall see and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the grass, and the hand of Yahweh shall make itself known to his servants, and he shall curse his enemies. 15 For look! Yahweh will come in fire, and his chariots like the storm wind, to give back his anger in wrath, and his rebuke in flames of fire. 16 For Yahweh enters into judgment on all flesh with fire and his sword, and those slain by Yahweh shall be many. 17 Those who sanctify themselves and those who cleanse themselves to go into the gardens after the one in the middle, eating the flesh of swine and detestable things and rodents together shall come to an end!” declares Yahweh. 18 “And I—their works and thoughts!—am about to come to gather all nations and tongues, and they shall come and see my glory. 19 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send survivors from them to the nations: Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow; Tubal and Javan, the faraway coastlands that have not heard of my fame, and have not seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations, 20 and bring all your countrymen from all the nations as an offering to Yahweh on horses and chariots and in litters and on mules and camels, to my holy mountain, Jerusalem,” says Yahweh, “just as the sons of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel to the house of Yahweh. 21 And indeed, I will take some of them as priests and the Levites,” says Yahweh. 22 “For just as the new heavens and earth that I am about to make shall stand before me,” declares Yahweh, “so shall your descendants and your name stand. 23 And this shall happen: From new moon to new moon and from Sabbath to Sabbath all flesh shall come to bow in worship before me,” says Yahweh. 24 “And they shall go out and look at the corpses of the people who have rebelled against me, for their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.” ",Isaiah 65:3-66:24,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/isaiah-653-6624-54995/direct-download/tbd20090529.mp3

Song of Solomon,"4 Draw me after you, let us run! May the king bring me into his chambers! Let us be joyful and let us rejoice in you; let us extol your love more than wine. Rightly do they love you! 5 I am black but beautiful, O maidens of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. 6 Do not gaze at me because I am black, because the sun has stared at me. The sons of my mother were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own “vineyard” I did not keep. 7 Tell me, you whom my heart loves, where do you pasture your flock, where do your sheep lie down at the noon? For why should I be like one who is veiled beside the flocks of your companions? 8 If you do not know, O fairest among women, follow the tracks of the flock, and pasture your little lambs beside the tents of the shepherds.

Song of Solomon,"1 I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. 2 Like a lily among the thorns, so is my love among the maidens. 3 As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. In his shade I sat down with delight, and his fruit was sweet to my palate. 4 He brought me to the house of the wine, and his intention was love toward me. 5 Sustain me with the raisins, refresh me with the apples, for I am lovesick. 6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me. 7 I adjure you, O maidens of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the does of the field, do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases!

Song of Solomon,"16 My beloved belongs to me and I belong to him; he pastures his flock among the lilies. 17 Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved! Be like a gazelle or young stag on the cleft mountains. 1 On my bed in the night, I sought him whom my heart loves. I sought him, but I did not find him. 2 Now I will arise, and I will go about in the city, in the streets and in the squares; I will seek him whom my heart loves. I sought him, but I did not find him. 3 The sentinels who go about in the city found me. “Have you seen the one whom my heart loves?” 4 Scarcely had I passed by them when I found him whom my heart loves. I held him and I would not let him go until I brought him to the house of my mother, into the bedroom chamber of she who conceived me. 5 I adjure you, O maidens of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the does of the field, do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases! 6 What is this coming up from the desert like a column of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense from all the fragrant powders of the merchant? 7 Look! It is Solomon’s portable couch! Sixty mighty men surround it, the mighty men of Israel. 8 All of them wield swords; they are trained in warfare, each with his sword at his thigh to guard against terror in the night. 9 King Solomon made for himself a sedan chair from the wood of Lebanon. 10 He made its column of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple; its interior is inlaid with leather by the maidens of Jerusalem. 11 Come out and look, O maidens of Zion, at King Solomon, at the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of the joy of his heart!

Song of Solomon,"1 Look! You are beautiful, my beloved! Look! You are beautiful! Your eyes are doves from behind your veil.

Your temple is like halves of pomegranate from behind your veil. 4 Your neck is like the tower of David, built in courses; a thousand ornaments are hung on it, all the shields of the warriors. 5 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle that feed among the lilies. 6 Until the day breathes and the shadows flee, I will go to the mountain of the myrrh, to the hill of the frankincense. 7 You are completely beautiful, my beloved! You are flawless! 8 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride! Come with me from Lebanon! Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the dwelling places of the lions, from the mountains of leopard. 9 You have stolen (my) heart, my sister bride! You have stolen my heart with one glance from your eyes, with one ornament from your necklaces. 10 How beautiful is your love, my sister bride! How better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice! 11 Your lips drip nectar, my bride; honey and milk are under your lips; the scent of your garments is like the scent of Lebanon. 12 A garden locked is my sister bride, a spring enclosed, a fountain sealed. 13 Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with choice fruit, henna with nard; 14 nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon spice with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes with all chief spices. 15 A garden fountain, a well of living water, flowing (streams) from Lebanon. 16 Awake, O north wind! Come, O south wind! Blow upon my garden! Let its fragrances waft forth! Let my beloved come to his garden, let him eat his choice fruit! 1 I have come to my garden, my sister bride, I have gathered my myrrh with my spice, I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk! Eat, O friends! Drink and become drunk with love! 2 I was asleep but my heart was awake. A sound! My beloved knocking! “Open to me, my sister, my beloved, my dove, my perfect one! For my head is full of dew, my hair drenched from the moist night air.” 3 I have taken off my tunic, must I put it on? I have bathed my feet, must I soil them? 4 My beloved thrust his hand into the opening, and my inmost yearned for him. 5 I myself arose to open to my beloved; my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh upon the handles of the bolt.

Tell him that I am lovesick! 9 How is your beloved better than another lover, O most beautiful among women? How is your beloved better than another lover, that you adjure us thus? 10 My beloved is radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand. 11 His head is gold, refined gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven. 12 His eyes are like doves beside springs of water, bathed in milk, set like mounted jewels. 13 His cheeks are like beds of spice, a tower of fragrances; his lips are lilies dripping liquid myrrh. 14 His arms are rods of gold engraved with jewels; his belly is polished ivory covered with sapphires. 15 His legs are columns of alabaster, set on bases of gold; his appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars. 16 His mouth is sweet, and he is altogether desirable.

Song of Solomon,"10 My beloved is radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand. 11 His head is gold, refined gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven. 12 His eyes are like doves beside springs of water, bathed in milk, set like mounted jewels. 13 His cheeks are like beds of spice, a tower of fragrances; his lips are lilies dripping liquid myrrh. 14 His arms are rods of gold engraved with jewels; his belly is polished ivory covered with sapphires. 15 His legs are columns of alabaster, set on bases of gold; his appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars. 16 His mouth is sweet, and he is altogether desirable. This is my beloved; this is my friend, O young women of Jerusalem. 1 Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned that we may seek him with you? 2 My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the garden bed of the spice, to pasture his flock and to gather lilies in the garden. 3 I belong to my beloved and my beloved belongs to me; he pastures his flock among the lilies. 4 You are beautiful, my beloved, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, overwhelming as an army with banners. 5 Turn away your eyes from before me, for they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of the goats that moves down from Gilead. 6 Your teeth are like a flock of the ewes that have come up from the washing, all of them bearing twins, and there is none bereaved among them. 7 Your cheeks behind your veil are like halves of a pomegranate. 8 Sixty queens there are, eighty concubines, and maidens beyond number. 9 My dove, she is the one; my perfect, she is the only one; she is the favorite of her mother who bore her. Maidens see her and consider her fortunate; queens and concubines praise her: 10 “Who is this that looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, overwhelming as an army with banners?” 11 I went down to the orchard of the walnut trees to look at the blossoms of the valley, to see whether the vines have sprouted, whether the pomegranates have blossomed. 12 I did not know my heart set me in a chariot of my princely people. 13 Turn, turn, O Shulammite! Turn, turn so that we may look upon you! Why do you look upon the Shulammite as at a dance of the two armies? 1 How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O royal princess! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a craftsman. 2 Your navel is a round wine-mixing bowl that does not lack mixed wine! Your belly is a heap of wheat encircled with lilies. 3 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle. 4 Your neck is like a tower of ivory; your eyes are pools in Heshbon at the gate of Beth Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking out over Damascus. 5 Your head crowns you like Carmel; the flowing locks of your head are like purple tapestry; a king is held captive in the tresses! 6 How beautiful you are and how pleasant, O loved one in the delights! 7 Your stature is like the palm tree, and your breasts are like clusters. 8 I say, “I will climb up the palm tree; I will lay hold of its fruit clusters.” Let your breasts be pleasing like clusters of the vine and the scent of your breath like the apples. 9 Your palate is like the best wine that goes down for my beloved, smoothly gliding over my lips and teeth. 10 I belong to my beloved, and he desires me! 11 Come, my beloved, let us go out to the countryside; let us spend the night in the villages. 12 Let us rise early to go to the vineyards; let us see whether the vine has budded, whether the grape blossom has opened, and whether the pomegranates are in bloom; there I will give my love to you. 13 The mandrakes give off their fragrance, and over our doorway is every kind of delicious fruit; both fresh and dried fruit I have stored up for you, O my beloved. 1 How I wish that you were my little brother, who nursed upon my mother’s breasts! If I met you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me! 2 I would surely bring you to the house of my mother, who would surely teach me; I would give you spiced wine to drink, the sweet wine of my pomegranates. 3 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me. 4 I adjure you, O maidens of Jerusalem, do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases! 5 Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you; there your mother conceived you; there she who was in labor gave birth to you. 6 Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong as death; passion is fierce as Sheol; its flashes are flashes of fire; it is a blazing flame. 7 Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If a man were to give all the wealth of his house for love, he would be utterly scorned. 8 We have a little sister, and she does not yet have any breasts. What should we do for our sister on the day when she is betrothed? 9 If she is a wall, we will adorn her with a turret of silver; but if she is a door, we will barricade her with boards of cedar. 10 I was a wall, and my breasts were like the towers, so my betrothed viewed me with great delight. 11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he entrusted his vineyard to the keepers; people paid a thousand silver pieces for its fruit. 12 My own “vineyard” belongs to me; the “thousand” are for you, O Solomon, and “two hundred” for those who tend its fruit. 13 O you who dwell in the garden, my companions are listening to your voice. Let me hear it! 14 Flee, my beloved! Be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the perfumed mountains!

Ecclesiastes,"1 The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 2 “Vanity of vanities!” says the Teacher, “Vanity of vanities! All is vanity!” 3 What does a person gain in all his toil with which he toils under the sun? 4 A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth stands forever. 5 The sun rises, and the sun goes down; to its place it hurries, and there it rises again.

Ecclesiastes,"5 The sun rises, and the sun goes down; to its place it hurries, and there it rises again. 6 The wind goes to the south and goes around to the north; around and around it goes, and on its circuit the wind returns. 7 All the streams flow to the sea, but the sea is never full; to the place where the streams flow, there they continue to flow. 8 All things toil continuously; no one can ever finish describing this. The eye is never satisfied with seeing, and the ear is never filled with hearing. 9 What has been—it is what will be; what has been done—it is what will be done; there is nothing new under the sun. 10 There is a thing of which it is said, “Look at this! This is new!” But it already existed in ages past before us. 11 There is neither remembrance of former generations, nor will there be remembrance of future generations. 12 I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 13 I applied my mind to seek and to search by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. It is a grievous task God has given to humans to be busy with. 14 I saw all the works that are done under the sun. Look! Everything is vanity and chasing wind.

Ecclesiastes,"15 What is twisted cannot be straightened, and what is lacking cannot be counted. 16 I said to myself, “Look! I have become great and have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has preceded me over Jerusalem. I have acquired a great deal of wisdom and knowledge.” 17 So I dedicated myself to learn about wisdom and to learn about delusion and folly. However, I discovered that this also is chasing wind. 18 For in much wisdom is much frustration, and whoever increases knowledge increases sorrow. 1 I said to myself, “Come! I will test pleasure to see whether it is worthwhile.” But look, “This also is vanity!” 2 I said of laughter, “It is folly!” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?” 3 I also explored the effects of indulging my flesh with wine. My mind guiding me with wisdom, I investigated folly so that I might discover what is good under heaven for humans to do during the days of their lives. 4 I accomplished great things. I built for myself houses; I planted for myself vineyards. 5 I made for myself gardens and parks, and I planted all sorts of fruit trees in them. 6 I made for myself pools of water from which to irrigate a grove of flourishing trees. 7 I acquired male slaves and female slaves, as well as children born in my house. I also had livestock, cattle, and flocks more than anyone who was before me in Jerusalem. 8 I also gathered to myself silver and gold—the royal and provincial treasuries. I acquired for myself male and female singers, as well as the delight of men, voluptuous concubines. 9 Thus, I accomplished far more than anyone who was before me in Jerusalem—indeed, my wisdom stood by me. 10 I neither withheld anything from my eyes that they desired, nor did I deprive any pleasure from my heart. My heart rejoiced in all my toil, for this was my reward from all my toil. ",Ecclesiastes 1:15-2:10,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ecclesiastes-115-210-47544/direct-download/tbd20090204.mp3
Ecclesiastes,"11 Yet when I considered all the effort which I expended and the toil with which I toiled to do, then behold, “Everything is vanity and chasing wind! There is nothing profitable under the sun!” 12 Next, I considered wisdom, as well as delusion and folly. What can anyone do who will come after the king that has not already been done? 13 I realized that wisdom has an advantage over folly, just as light has an advantage over darkness. 14 The wise man can see where he is walking, but the fool walks in darkness. Yet I also realized that both of them suffer the same fate. 15 So I said to myself, “If I also suffer the same fate as the fool, what advantage is my great wisdom?” So I said to myself, “This also is vanity!” 16 Certainly no one will remember the wise man or the fool in future generations. When future days come, both will have been forgotten already. How is it that the wise man dies the same as the fool? 17 So I hated life because the work done under the sun is grievous to me. For everything is vanity and chasing wind! 18 So I hated all my toil with which I have toiled under the sun, for I must leave it behind to someone who will be after me. 19 And who knows whether he will be wise or foolish? Yet he will exercise control of all the fruit of my toil with which I toiled wisely under the sun. This also is vanity! 20 So I began to despair of all the toil with which I toiled under the sun. 21 For there is a person who toils with wisdom and knowledge and skill, but he must leave his reward to someone who has not toiled for it. This also is vanity and a great calamity. 22 For what does a person receive for all his toil and in the longing of his heart with which he toils under the sun? 23 All his days are painful, his labor brings grief, and his heart cannot rest at night. This also is vanity! 24 There is nothing better for a person than to eat and drink and find delight in his toil. For I also realized that this is from the hand of God! 25 For who can eat, and who can enjoy life apart from him? 26 For to the person who is good in his eyes, he gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and heaping up only to give it to him who is pleasing in the eyes of God. This also is vanity and chasing wind! 1 For everything there is an appointed time, a time for every matter under heaven: ",Ecclesiastes 2:11-3:1,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ecclesiastes-211-31-47545/direct-download/tbd20090205.mp3
Ecclesiastes,"1 For everything there is an appointed time, a time for every matter under heaven: 2 a time to bear and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to root up what is planted; 3 a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to break down and a time to build up; 4 a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance; 5 a time to throw away stones and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing; 6 a time to seek and a time to lose; a time to keep and a time to throw away; 7 a time to tear and a time to sew; a time to be silent and a time to speak; 8 a time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace. 9 What does the worker gain in his toil? 10 I have seen the business God gives to humans to preoccupy them. 11 He has made everything suitable in its time. He also has put the past in their hearts, yet no one can grasp what God does from the beginning to the end. 12 So I realized that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and enjoy themselves during their lives. 13 And for anyone to eat and drink, that is, to enjoy the fruit of all his toil, this also is a gift of God. 14 I know everything God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, and nothing can be taken from it, for God so acts that humans might stand in awe before him. 15 What is—it already was, and what will be—it already is, for God will do what he has done. 16 I saw something else under the sun: instead of justice there was evil; instead of righteousness there was wickedness. 17 So I said to myself, “God will surely judge the righteous and the wicked, for he has appointed a time of judgment for every deed and every work.” 18 I said to myself concerning humans, “God sifts them in order to show them that they are like beasts.” 19 For the fate of humans and the fate of the beast is the same. The death of the one is like the death of the other, for both are mortal. Man has no advantage over the beast, for both are fleeting. 20 Both go to one place—both came from dust and both return to dust. 21 For no one knows whether the spirit of a human ascends to heaven and whether the spirit of the beast descends to the ground! 22 So I concluded that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy the fruit of his labor, for this is his lot in life. For no one knows what will happen in the future. 1 I looked again, and I saw all the oppression that occurs under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed— no one comforts them! Those who oppress them are powerful— no one can comfort them! 2 So I deemed the dead who have already died more fortunate than the living who are still alive. 3 But better off than both of them is the one who has not yet been born and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun. 4 I also realized that all of the toil and all of the skillful work that is done—it is envy between one man and another. This also is vanity and chasing wind! 5 The fool refuses to work with his hands, so he has nothing to eat except his own skin! 6 Better is one handful with peace than two fists full with toil and chasing wind. 7 I turned again and saw another vanity under the sun. 8 Sometimes a man is all alone with no companion; he also has neither son nor brother. Yet there is no end to all his toil, and his eye is not satisfied with wealth. He laments, “For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?” This also is vanity—it is an unhappy business! 9 Two are better than the one, for they enjoy a better reward for their toil. ",Ecclesiastes 3:1-4:9,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ecclesiastes-31-49-47546/direct-download/tbd20090206.mp3
Ecclesiastes,"9 Two are better than the one, for they enjoy a better reward for their toil. 10 For if they fall, one will help up his companion. But pity the one who falls and there is no one to help him up. 11 Also if two lie together, they can keep each other warm. But how can one person be warm? 12 Although an assailant may overpower one person, two may withstand him. A threefold cord is not easily broken! 13 A poor but wise youth is better than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to receive advice. 14 For he came out of the prison house to reign, since he was born poor in his kingdom. 15 I saw all the living who move about under the sun with the youth; the second who will stand in his place. 16 There is no end to all the people, to all who were before him. Yet the later generation will not rejoice in him, for this also is vanity and chasing wind! 1 Guard your steps when you go to the house of God; draw near to listen rather than to offer a sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil. 2 Do not be rash with your mouth, and do not let your heart be quick to utter a word before God. For God is in heaven, and you are on earth; therefore, let your words be few. 3 For a dream comes with many cares, and the voice of a fool with many words. 4 When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it, for he takes no pleasure in fools. Fulfill what you vow! 5 It is better that you not vow than that you vow and not fulfill it. 6 Do not let your mouth lead your flesh into sin, and do not tell the messenger that it was a mistake. Why anger God at your words, so that he destroys the work of your hands?

Ecclesiastes,"7 For with many dreams come vanities and numerous words. Therefore, fear God! 8 Do not be surprised if you see the poor being oppressed with violence or do not see justice and righteousness in the province. For one official is watched by a higher official, and there are even higher officials over them! 9 The produce of the land is exploited by everyone; even the king profits from the field of the poor! 10 Whoever loves money is not satisfied with money, and whoever loves wealth is not satisfied with profit. This also is vanity! 11 When prosperity increases, those who consume it increase. So its owner gains nothing, except to see his wealth before it is spent. 12 The sleep of the laborer is pleasant, whether he eats little or much, but the wealth of the rich man does not allow him to rest. 13 There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth hoarded by its owner to his harm. 14 That wealth was lost in a bad venture. Although he has borne a child, he has nothing to leave to him. 15 Just as he came from his mother’s womb naked, he will depart just as he came; he will take nothing with him for his toil. 16 This also is a grievous illness. Exactly as he came, so he will go. What profit does he gain for all his toil for the wind? 17 Also, he eats in darkness all his days; he is frustrated in much sickness and resentment. 18 Look! I have discovered what is good and fitting: to eat and to drink and to enjoy all the fruit of the toil with which one toils under the sun during the number of the days of his life that God gives to him—for this is his lot. 19 This indeed is a gift of God: everyone to whom God gives wealth and possessions, he also empowers him to enjoy them, to accept his lot, and to rejoice in the fruit of his toil. 20 For he does not remember the brief days of his life, for God keeps his heart preoccupied with enjoyment of life. 1 Here is another misfortune that I have seen under the sun, and it is prevalent among humankind. 2 God gives a man wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires; yet God does not enable him to enjoy it—instead someone else ends up enjoying it. This is vanity—indeed, it is a grievous ill! 3 Even if a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years so that the days of his years are many, if his heart is not satisfied with his prosperity and he does not receive a proper burial, I deem the stillborn better than him. 4 For he comes into vanity and departs into darkness, and his name is shrouded in darkness. 5 He has neither seen nor known the sun, yet he has more rest than him. 6 Even if a man lives a thousand years twice, if he does not enjoy prosperity, both suffer the same fate! 7 All of a man’s toil is for his mouth— yet his appetite is never satisfied. 8 So do the wise really have an advantage over fools? Can the poor really gain anything by knowing how to act in front of others? 9 Better to be content with what your eyes see than for your soul to constantly crave more. This also is vanity and chasing wind! 10 Whatever is—it was already determined, what will be—it has already been decided. As for man, he cannot argue against what is more powerful than him. 11 Increasing words only multiplies futility, how does that profit anyone? 12 For who knows what is good for a man in his life during the few days of his fleeting life, which are fleeting as a shadow? For who can tell anyone what will happen in the future under the sun?

Ecclesiastes,"1 A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death is better than the day of one’s birth. 2 Better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for death is the end of every person, and the living should take it to his heart. 3 Sorrow is better than laughter, for by sadness of countenance the heart is made good. 4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. 5 Better to listen to the rebuke of the wise than for a man to listen to the song of fools. 6 Like the sound of thorns under a pot, so also the laughter of fools. This also is vanity! 7 Surely oppression makes a fool of the wise, and a bribe corrupts the heart. 8 The end of a matter is better than its beginning; better to be slow to anger than hot-headed. 9 Do not be quick in your spirit to anger, for anger lodges in the bosom of fools. 10 Do not say, “Why were the former days better than these?” For it is not from wisdom that you ask this. 11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance; it benefits the living. 12 For wisdom offers protection like money offers protection. But knowledge has an advantage—wisdom restores life to its possessor. 13 Consider the work of God. For who is able to make straight what he made crooked? 14 In the day of prosperity, rejoice! But in the day of adversity, consider! For God made one in place of another so that mortals cannot find out what will happen in the future. 15 I have seen all these things in my vain life: Sometimes a righteous man perishes in spite of his righteousness, and sometimes a wicked man lives a long life in spite of his evil. 16 Do not be excessively righteous, and do not act excessively wise, lest you destroy yourself. 17 Do not act excessively wicked, and do not be a fool, lest you die before your time. 18 It is good to take hold of the one and also must not let go of the other; for whoever fears God will hold both of them secure. 19 Wisdom gives more strength to the wise than ten rulers who are in the city. 20 Surely there is no one righteous on the earth who continually does good and never sins. 21 Do not pay attention to everything people say, lest you hear your own servant curse you. 22 For your heart knows that you also have cursed others many times. 23 All this I have tested with wisdom. I said, “I will be wise!” but it was beyond my grasp. 24 Whatever is—it is far beyond comprehension. Who can discover it? 25 I set my mind to try to seek wisdom and the plan, and to know that wickedness is foolishness and that folly is delusion. 26 I myself found that more bitter than death is the woman who is a trap, whose heart is a snare, and whose hands are bonds. The one who pleases God escapes from her, but the sinner is caught by her. 27 “Look! I found this,” said the Teacher, “while trying to find how the plan fits together. 28 What my heart sought, I did not find. Although I found one righteous man among one thousand, I did not find one upright woman among all these. 29 Look! This alone I found: God made mankind upright, but they have devised many schemes.” 1 Who is like the sage? Who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man’s wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed. 2 Keep the command of the king because of your oath to God. 3 Do not be terrified of his presence! Go at once and do not delay when a matter is unpleasant, for he can do anything that he desires. 4 Since the word of the king is supreme, no one can say to him, “What are you doing?” 5 Whoever obeys his command will not suffer disaster. The wise mind knows the proper time and the right procedure. 6 For there is a proper time and right procedure for every matter, even though the trouble of man weighs heavy upon him. 7 Surely no one knows what will be, so who can tell anyone what will happen? 8 Just as no one can control the wind to restrain the wind, so also no one can control the day of his death. Just as no one is discharged in time of war, so wickedness will not deliver the wicked. 9 I saw all this as I applied my heart to all the deeds done under the sun: sometimes those in authority harm others. 10 Meanwhile, I saw the wicked being honorably buried, but those who came and went from the holy place were forgotten in the city, even though they had done so. This also is vanity! 11 Because sentence against an evil deed is not carried out quickly, the heart of humans fills up within them to do evil. 12 Although the sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I also know that it will be good for those who fear God—because they fear his presence. 13 But it will not go well with the wicked, and they will not prolong their days, like the shadow; because there is no fearing God’s presence. 14 There is a vanity that happens on earth: sometimes the righteous suffer what the wicked deserve, and sometimes the wicked receive what the righteous deserve. I said, “This also is vanity!” 15 So I recommend enjoyment. For there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat and to drink and to rejoice. This will accompany him in his toil the days of his life that God gives to him under the sun. 16 I applied my mind to know wisdom and to understand the business that is done on earth—how neither day nor night one’s eyes see sleep. 17 Then I saw all the work of God—man is not able to discover the work that is done under the sun. Although man may toil in seeking, he cannot find it. Even if a wise man claims that he knows it, he cannot find it.

Ecclesiastes,"1 So all this I laid to my heart, and I concluded that the righteous and the wise, as well as their deeds, are in the hand of God. So no one knows anything that will come to them, whether it will be love or hatred. 2 The same fate comes to everyone: to the righteous and to the wicked, to the good and to the wicked, to the clean and to the unclean, to those who sacrifice and to those who do not sacrifice. As with the good man, so also to the sinner; as with those who swear an oath, so also those who fear oaths. 3 This is the injustice that is done under the sun: the same fate comes to everyone. Also the hearts of humans are full of evil; delusion is in their hearts during their lives, and then they die. 4 Whoever is joined to all the living has hope. After all, even a live dog is better than a dead lion! 5 For the living know that they will die, but the dead do not know anything. They no longer have a reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten. 6 What they loved and hated, as well as what they desired, has already perished. They no longer have any share in what is done under the sun. 7 Go—eat your food with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart! For God already has approved your deeds. 8 Always be clothed in white garments, and never let your head lack oil! 9 Enjoy life with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which he gives you under the sun, because this is your lot in life and in the toil with which you toil under the sun. 10 Whatever your hand finds to do—do it with all your might; for in Sheol—where you are going—no one works, plans, knows, or thinks about anything. 11 I looked again and saw under the sun that the race does not belong to the swift, the battle does not belong to the mighty, food does not belong to the wise, wealth does not belong to the intelligent, and success does not belong to the skillful, for time and chance befalls all of them. 12 For man does not know his time. Just as fish are caught in a cruel net and like birds who are seized in a snare, so also humans are ensnared at a cruel time when it falls suddenly upon them. 13 I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me. 14 There was a small city with few people in it. A great king came and besieged it, building great siege works against it.

A great king came and besieged it, building great siege works against it. 15 Now, a poor wise man was found in it, and he delivered the city by his wisdom. But no one remembered that poor man. 16 So I concluded that wisdom is better than might, yet the wisdom of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard. 17 The words of the wise are heard in peace more than the shouting of a ruler is heard among the fools. 18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good. 1 Dead flies cause a bad smell and ruin the ointment of the perfumer. So also a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. 2 The heart of the wise inclines to his right, but the heart of the fool inclines to his left. 3 Even when the fool walks along the road, he lacks sense; he tells everyone that he is a fool. 4 If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your post, for calmness can undo great offenses. 5 There is an evil I have seen under the sun— it is an error that proceeds from a ruler! 6 The fool is set in many high places, but the rich sit in lowly places. 7 I have even seen slaves riding on horses and princes walking like slaves on the earth! 8 Whoever digs a pit will fall into it. Whoever breaks through a wall, a snake will bite him. 9 Whoever quarries stones will be wounded by them. Whoever splits logs will be endangered by them. 10 If the ax is blunt but one does not sharpen its edge, he must exert more effort, but the advantage of wisdom is it brings success.

Ecclesiastes,"11 If the snake bites before the charming, the snake charmer will not succeed. 12 The wise man wins favor by the words of his mouth, but the fool is devoured by his own lips. 13 He begins by saying what is foolish and ends by uttering what is wicked delusion. 14 The fool talks too much, for no one knows what will be. Who can tell anyone what will happen in the future? 15 The fool is so worn out by a hard day’s work he cannot even find his way home at night. 16 Woe to you, O land, when your king is a youth and your princes feast in the morning. 17 Blessed are you, O land, when your king is a son of nobility and your princes feast at the proper time— to gain strength and not to get drunk. 18 Through sloth the roof sinks in, and through idleness of hands the house leaks. 19 Feasts are held for celebration, wine cheers the living, and money answers everything. 20 Do not curse the king even in your thoughts, and do not curse the rich even in your own bedroom, for a bird of the sky may carry your voice; a winged messenger may repeat your words. 1 Send out your bread on the water, for in many days you will find it. 2 Divide your share in seven or in eight, for you do not know what disaster will happen on the earth. 3 When the clouds are full, they empty rain on the earth. Whether a tree falls to the south or whether it falls to the north, the place where the tree falls—there it will be. 4 Whoever watches the wind will not sow; whoever watches the clouds will not reap. 5 Just as you do not know how the path of the wind goes, nor how the bones of a fetus form in a mother’s womb, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything. 6 Sow your seed in the morning, and do not let your hands rest in the evening, for you do not know what will prosper— whether this or that, or whether both of them alike will succeed. 7 The light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun. 8 For if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in all of them! Let him remember that the days of the darkness will be many— all that is coming is vanity! 9 Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth! Follow the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes— but know that God will bring you into judgment for all these things. 10 Banish anxiety from your heart, and put away pain from your body, for youth and vigor are vanity.

Ecclesiastes,"1 Remember your Creator in the days of your youth— before the days of trouble come and the years draw near when you will say, “I find no pleasure in them!” 2 Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars darken and the clouds return after the rain. 3 When the guards of the house tremble, and the men of strength are bent; the grinders cease because they are few, and those looking through the windows see dimly. 4 When the doors on the street are shut, when the sound of the grinding mill is low; one rises up to the sound of the bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low. 5 They are afraid of heights, and terrors are on the road. The almond tree blossoms, and the grasshopper draws itself along, and desire fails because man goes to his eternal home, and the mourners go about in the streets. 6 Before the silver cord is snapped and the golden bowl is broken; and the jar at the foundation is broken, and the wheel at the cistern is broken. 7 And the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the breath returns to God who gave it. 8 “Vanity of vanity!” says the Teacher. “Everything is vanity!” 9 The Teacher was full of wisdom, and he taught the people with knowledge. He carefully considered many proverbs and carefully arranged them. 10 The Teacher sought to find delightful words, and he wrote what is upright—truthful words. 11 The words of the wise are like cattle goads; the collections of the sages are like pricks inflicted by one shepherd. 12 My son, be careful about anything beyond these things. For the writing of books is endless, and too much study is wearisome. 13 Now that all has been heard, here is the final conclusion: Fear God and obey his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. 14 For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.

Proverbs,"1 Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel: 2 To know wisdom and instruction, to understand sayings of understanding, 3 to gain insightful instruction, righteousness and justice and equity, 4 to give shrewdness to the simple, knowledge and purpose to the young, 5 may the wise hear and increase learning, and the one who understands gain direction, ",Proverbs 1:1-5,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/proverbs-11-5-40606/direct-download/tbd20081124.mp3
Proverbs,"5 may the wise hear and increase learning, and the one who understands gain direction, 6 to understand a proverb and an expression, words of wisdom and their riddles. 7 Fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; wisdom and instruction, fools despise. 8 My child, may you keep your father’s instruction, and do not reject your mother’s teachings, 9 for they are a garland of favor for your head, and pendants for your neck. 10 My child, if sinners entice you, do not consent. 11 If they say, “Come with us! We shall lie in wait for blood; we shall ambush the innocent without cause. 12 Like Sheol, we will swallow them alive and whole, like those who descend to the pit. 13 We shall find all precious wealth, we shall fill our houses with booty, 14 you shall throw your lot in our midst, there will be one purse for all of us.” 15 My child, do not walk in their way. Keep your foot from their paths, 16 for their feet run to evil, and they hurry to shed blood, 17 for “in vain is the net scattered, in the sight of any winged bird.” 18 They lie in wait for their own blood. They ambush their own lives. 19 Thus are the ways of all who are greedy for gain— it will take the life of its possessors. 20 Wisdom calls out in the streets, in the squares she raises her voice. 21 On a busy corner she cries out, at the entrances of the gates in the city, she speaks her sayings: 22 “How long, O simple ones, will you love simplicity? And how long will scoffers delight in their scoffing, and fools hate knowledge? 23 May you turn to my argument! Behold, I shall pour out my spirit upon you; I will make my words known to you. 24 Because I called out and you refused me, I stretched out my hand, yet there is none who heeds. 25 You have ignored all my counsel, and my reproof you are not willing to accept. 26 I will also laugh at your calamity; I will mock when panic comes upon you. 27 When your panic comes like a storm, and your calamity arrives like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you, 28 then they will call me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but not find me. 29 Since they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Yahweh, 30 they were not willing to accept my counsel, they despised all my reproof. 31 They shall eat from the fruit of their way, and they shall be sated from their own schemes, 32 for the waywardness of the simple ones will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them. 33 Whoever listens to me will dwell in security and rest securely from dread and disaster.” ",Proverbs 1:5-33,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/proverbs-15-33-40607/direct-download/tbd20081125.mp3
Proverbs,"1 My child, if you will receive my sayings, and hide my commands with you, 2 in order to incline your ear toward wisdom, then you shall apply your heart to understanding. 3 For if you cry out for understanding, if you lift your voice for insight, 4 if you seek her like silver and search her out like treasure, 5 then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, and the knowledge of God you will find. 6 For Yahweh will give wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 For the upright, he stores sound judgment, a shield for those who walk uprightly, 8 in order to guard paths of justice and keep the way of his faithful ones. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice and uprightness—every good course— 10 for wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul. 11 Discretion will watch over you; understanding will protect you, 12 in order to deliver you from the way of evil, from a man who speaks devious things— 13 those who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in ways of darkness, 14 those who are happy to do evil, for they delight in the deviousness of evil, 15 who are crooked in their ways, and devious in their paths; 16 in order to deliver you from a strange woman, from a foreign woman who flatters with her sayings, 17 she who forsakes the partner of her youth and has forgotten the covenant of her God, 18 for her house sinks to death, and to the dead are her paths. 19 Of all who go to her, none shall return, nor do they reach paths of life. 20 So that you will walk on the road of those who are good, and the paths of those who are righteous you shall keep. 21 For those who are upright will dwell in the land, and those who are blameless will remain in it. 22 And those who are wicked will be cut off from the land, and those who are treacherous will be uprooted from it.

Do not be weary of his reproof 12 because whomever Yahweh will love, he will rebuke, as a father delights in his son. 13 Happy is the one who finds wisdom, and one who obtains understanding. 14 For her income is better than the income of silver, and her revenue than that of gold. 15 She is more precious than rubies, and all your desires shall not compare with her. 16 Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. 17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. 18 She is a tree of life for those who seize her; those who take hold of her are considered happy. 19 Yahweh in wisdom founded the earth; he established the heavens in understanding. 20 With his knowledge, depths broke open, and clouds dropped dew. 21 My child, may they not escape from your sight; may you keep sound wisdom and prudence. 22 They shall be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.

Do not let go! Guard her, for she is your life. 14 In the path of the wicked do not go; do not walk in the way of those who do evil. 15 Avoid it; do not transgress it; turn away from it and pass by. 16 For they will not sleep if they have not done wrong, and they are robbed of their sleep if they do not cause stumbling. 17 For they ate the bread of wickedness, and they drank the wine of violence. 18 But the path of the righteous ones is like the light of dawn, leading and shining until the day is full. 19 The way of the wicked ones is like deep darkness; they do not know what they stumble over. 20 My child, be attentive to my words; to my sayings incline your ear. 21 May they not escape from your sight; keep them in the midst of your heart. 22 For they are life to those who find them and healing to the entire body. 23 With all vigilance, keep your heart, for from it comes the source of life. 24 Remove from yourself deceitful speech, and abolish devious talk from yourself. 25 May your eyes look forward and your gaze be straight before you. 26 May the path of your foot be balanced and all your ways be sure. 27 Do not swerve right or left; remove your foot from evil. 1 My child, be attentive to my wisdom, and to my understanding incline your ear; 2 in order to keep prudence, and knowledge will guard your lips. 3 For the lips of the strange woman will drip honey, and smoother than oil is her mouth. 4 But her end is bitter as the wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold of Sheol. 6 She does not observe the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it. 7 Now, O children, listen to me; do not depart from the sayings of my mouth. 8 Keep your paths far from her, and do not go near to the door of her house, 9 lest you give your honor to the others, and your years to the merciless, 10 lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner, 11 and you groan at your end, when your flesh and body are consumed, 12 and say “How I hated discipline, and I despised reproof!” 13 and “I did not listen to the voice of my teachers, and I did not incline my ear to my instructors! 14 I was almost at utter ruin in the midst of the assembly and congregation.” ",Proverbs 4:10-5:14,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/proverbs-410-514-40611/direct-download/tbd20081201.mp3
Proverbs,"15 Drink water from your own cistern and flowing waters from inside your own well. 16 Shall your springs be scattered outward? In the streets, shall there be streams of water? 17 May they be yours alone, and not for strangers who are with you. 18 May your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a deer of love and a doe of grace; may her breasts satisfy you always; by her love may you be intoxicated continually. 20 Why should you be intoxicated, my child, by a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a foreigner? 21 For before the eyes of Yahweh are human ways, and all his paths he examines. 22 His iniquities shall ensnare him, the evildoer, and in the vanity of his sin he shall be caught. 23 He shall die for lack of discipline, and in the greatness of his folly he shall be lost. 1 My child, if you have pledged to your neighbor, if you have bound yourself to the stranger, 2 if you are snared by the sayings of your mouth, if you are caught by the sayings of your mouth, 3 do this, then, my child, and save yourself, for you have come into the palm of your neighbor’s hand: Go, humble yourself, plead with your neighbor. 4 Do not give sleep to your eyes, or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Save yourself like a gazelle from a hand, or like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, lazy! Consider its ways and be wise. 7 It has no chief, officer, or ruler. 8 In the summer, it prepares its food; in the harvest, it gathers its sustenance. 9 How long will you lie down, lazy? When will you rise up from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands for rest— 11 like a robber shall your poverty come, and what you lack like an armed man. 12 A worthless man, an evil man, goes around with deceitful speech. 13 Winking in his eye, shuffling in his foot, pointing in his fingers, 14 perversion in his heart, he devises evil; at all times he will send out discord. 15 Upon such a man, suddenly shall his calamity come; in a moment he will be damaged and there is no healing.

Proverbs,"16 There are six things Yahweh hates, and seven things are abominations of his soul: 17 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 18 a devising heart, plans of deception, feet that hurry to run to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies and sends out discord between brothers. 20 My child, keep the commandment of your father, and do not disregard the instruction of your mother. 21 Bind them on your heart continually; tie them upon your neck. 22 When you walk, she will lead you, When you lie down, she will watch over you, and when you awake, she will converse with you. 23 For like a lamp is a commandment, and instruction is light, and the way of life is the reproof of discipline, 24 in order to preserve you from an evil woman, from the smoothness of the tongue of an adulteress.

Proverbs,"24 in order to preserve you from an evil woman, from the smoothness of the tongue of an adulteress. 25 Do not desire her beauty in your heart; may she not capture you with her eyelashes. 26 For the price of a woman, a prostitute, is the price of a loaf of bread, but the woman belonging to a man hunts precious life. 27 Can a man carry fire in his lap, and his clothes not burn? 28 If a man walks upon the hot coals, will his feet not be burned? 29 Thus, he who goes to the wife of his neighbor, any who touches her shall not go unpunished. 30 People do not despise a thief when he steals to fill himself when he is hungry. 31 But if he is found, he will pay sevenfold, every possession of his house he shall give. 32 He who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense, he destroys himself who does it. 33 A wound and dishonor he will find, and his disgrace will not be wiped out. 34 For jealousy is the fury of a husband, and he will not show restraint on the day of revenge. 35 He will not accept any compensation, and he will not be willing, though the bribe is large. 1 My child, guard my sayings; store my commandments with you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my teaching like the apple of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, “you are my sister,” and you shall call insight, “intimate friend.” 5 In order to guard yourself from an adulteress, from the foreigner who makes her words smooth. 6 For at the window of my house, through my lattice, I looked down. 7 And I saw among the simple, I observed among the youth, a young man lacking sense, 8 passing on the street at her corner, and he takes the road to her house, 9 at twilight, at the day’s evening, in the midst of night and the darkness. 10 Then behold! A woman comes to meet him with the garment of a prostitute and a secret heart. 11 She is loud and stubborn; her feet do not stay at her house. 12 Now in the street, now in the square, at every corner she lies in wait. 13 She took hold of him and kissed him. Her face was impudent, and she said to him, 14 “Sacrifices of peace offerings are upon me; today I completed my vows. 15 So I have come out to meet you, to seek your face, and I have found you. 16 With coverings I have adorned my couch, spreads of the linen of Egypt; 17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let us take our fill of love making, until the morning let us delight in love. 19 For there is no man in his home; he has gone on a long journey. 20 The bag of money he took in his hand, for on the day of the full moon he will come home.” 21 She persuades him with the greatness of her teachings; with her smooth lips she compels him. 22 He goes after her suddenly; like an ox to the slaughter he goes, and like a stag to the instruction of a fool, 23 until an arrow pierces his entrails, like a bird rushing into a snare, but he does not know that it will cost him his life. 24 And now, my children, listen to me, and be attentive to the sayings of my mouth. 25 May your heart not turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her path. 26 For many slain she has laid low, and countless are all of her killings. 27 The ways of Sheol are her house, descending to chambers of death. 1 Does not wisdom call, and understanding raise its voice? 2 Atop the heights beside the road, at the crossroads she stands. 3 Beside gates, before towns, at the entrance of doors, she cries out: 4 “To you, O people, I call, and my cry is to the children of humankind. 5 Learn prudence, O simple ones; fools, learn intelligence. 6 Listen! For noble things I will speak, and upright things from the opening of my lips. 7 My mouth will utter truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 8 All sayings of my mouth are in righteousness; none of them are twisted and crooked. 9 All of them are straight to him who understands, and upright to those who find knowledge.

Proverbs,"8 All sayings of my mouth are in righteousness; none of them are twisted and crooked. 9 All of them are straight to him who understands, and upright to those who find knowledge. 10 Take my teaching and not silver; may you choose knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 For wisdom is better than jewels, and all desires shall not compare with her. 12 I, wisdom, live with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. 13 The fear of Yahweh is hatred of evil, pride, and arrogance and an evil way. And I hate a mouth of perversity. 14 Advice and sound judgment are mine; I am understanding, strength is mine. 15 By me kings reign, and rulers decree righteousness. 16 By me rulers rule, and nobles—all judges of righteousness. 17 I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently shall find me. 18 Fortune and glory are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even refined gold, and my yield than choice silver. 20 In the way of righteousness I walk, in the midst of paths of justice, 21 in order to endow those who love me with wealth, and I will fill their treasuries. 22 “Yahweh created me, the first of his ways, before his acts of old. 23 From eternity, I was set up from the first, from the beginning of the earth. 24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth, when there were no springs of abounding water. 25 Before mountains had been shaped, before hills, I was brought forth. 26 When he had not yet made earth and fields, or the first dust of the world, 27 when he established the heavens, there I was, when he drew a circle upon the face of the deep, 28 when he made skies from above, when he founded fountains of the deep, 29 when he assigned his limits to the sea, that waters shall not transgress his command, when he marked the foundations of the earth, 30 I was beside him, a master workman, and I was delighting day by day, rejoicing before him always, 31 rejoicing in the world of his earth, and my delight was with the children of humankind. 32 “And now, children, listen to me; happy are those who will keep my ways. 33 Hear teaching and be wise; do not neglect it. 34 Happy is the person who listens to me, in order to keep watch at my doors day by day, in order to guard the frames of my entrances. 35 For he who finds me is he who finds life, and he obtains favor from Yahweh. 36 But he who misses me injures himself.

Proverbs,"1 Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars. 2 She has slaughtered her slaughtering, mixed her wine, and also set her table. 3 She has sent her servant girls, she calls upon the wings of the high places of town, 4 “Whoever is simple, let him turn here.” As for the one who lacks sense, she says to him, 5 “Come, eat with my bread; drink with the wine I have mixed. 6 Lay aside simplicity and live; walk in the way of understanding.” 7 He who corrects a scoffer gains abuse for himself, and he who rebukes the wicked gets hurt. 8 Do not rebuke a scoffer, lest he hate you; rebuke the wise and he will love you. 9 Give to a wise one and he will become more wise; teach a righteous one and he will increase learning. 10 The start of wisdom is fear of Yahweh, and knowledge of the Holy One, insight. 11 For by me your days shall increase, and years of life shall multiply for you. 12 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, and if you scoff, alone you shall bear it. 13 A woman of foolishness is loud, simple, and does not know it. 14 She sits at the door of her house, upon a throne at the high places of town, 15 in order to call to those who pass by the road, those who go straight on their way: 16 “Whoever is simple, may he turn here!” As for he who lacks sense, she says to him, 17 “Stolen waters are sweet, and bread of secrecy is pleasant.” 18 But he does not know that the dead are there, in the depths of Sheol are her guests. 1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child grieves his mother. 2 Treasures of wickedness do not profit, but righteousness delivers from death. 3 Yahweh will not cause a righteous person to go hungry, but the craving of the wicked he will thwart. 4 A slack hand causes poverty, but the hand of the diligent enriches.

Proverbs,"3 Yahweh will not cause a righteous person to go hungry, but the craving of the wicked he will thwart. 4 A slack hand causes poverty, but the hand of the diligent enriches. 5 He who gathers in the summer is a child who is prudent; he who sleeps at the harvest is a child who brings shame. 6 Blessings belong to the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of righteousness is like a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot. 8 A heart of wisdom will heed commandments, but a babbling fool will come to ruin. 9 Whoever walks in integrity will walk securely, but whoever follows perversity, his ways will be made known. 10 The winking of an eye causes trouble, and the foolishness of lips comes to ruin. 11 A fountain of life is a mouth of righteousness, and a mouth of wickedness conceals violence. 12 Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers over all offenses. 13 On the lips of one who has understanding, wisdom is found, but a rod is for the back of one who lacks sense. 14 Those who are wise lay up knowledge, but to the mouth of the fool, ruin draws near. 15 The wealth of the rich is the city of his strength; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wage of the righteous leads to life; the gain of the wicked to sin. 17 On the path to life is he who guards instruction, but he who rejects rebuke goes astray. 18 He who conceals hatred has lips of deceit, and he who utters slander—he is a fool. 19 In many words, transgression is not lacking, but he who restrains his lips is prudent. 20 Choice silver is a tongue of righteousness, a heart of wickedness is of little worth. 21 Lips of righteousness feed many, but fools die for lack of sense. 22 The blessing of Yahweh makes one rich, and he does not increase sorrow with it. 23 It is like a sport for a fool to do wrong, wisdom for a person of understanding. 24 The dread of the wicked will come upon him, but the desire of the righteous will be granted. 25 With the passing of the tempest, there is no wickedness, but the righteous have a foundation forever. 26 Like vinegar to the tooth and like smoke to the eyes, thus is the lazy to one who employs him. 27 The fear of Yahweh adds life, but the years of the wicked are shortened. 28 The hope of the righteous is gladness, but the expectation of the wicked comes to nothing. 29 A stronghold for the upright is the way of Yahweh, but ruin belongs to evildoers. 30 The righteous one is forever; he will not be removed. But the wicked will not remain in the land. 31 The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, but a tongue of perversity will be cut off. 32 The lips of the righteous know the acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked, the perverse. 1 Balances of deceit are an abomination of Yahweh, but an accurate weight delights him.

Proverbs,"1 Balances of deceit are an abomination of Yahweh, but an accurate weight delights him. 2 Pride comes, then disgrace comes, but wisdom is with the humble. 3 The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them. 4 Wealth does not profit on the day of wrath, but righteousness will deliver from death. 5 The righteousness of the blameless will keep his ways straight, but the wicked will fall by his wickedness. 6 The righteousness of the upright will save them, but by a scheme the treacherous will be taken captive. 7 With the death of a wicked person, hope will die, and the expectation of the godless perishes. 8 The righteous is delivered from trouble, but the wicked enters into it. 9 With a mouth, the godless shall destroy his neighbor, but by knowledge the righteous are delivered. 10 When good is with the righteous, the city rejoices, and with the perishing of the wicked, jubilation. 11 By the blessing of the upright, a city will be exalted, but by the mouth of the wicked, it will be overthrown. 12 He who lacks sense belittles his neighbor, but a person of intelligence will remain silent. 13 A gossip walks about telling a secret, but the trustworthy in spirit keeps the matter. 14 Where there is no guidance, a nation shall fall, but there is safety in an abundance of counsel. 15 He will suffer trouble when he loans to a stranger, but he who refuses a pledge is safe. 16 A woman of grace receives honor, but the ruthless gets wealth. 17 A person of kindness rewards himself, but a cruel person harms his own flesh. 18 The wicked earns deceptive gain, but he who sows righteousness, a true reward. 19 He who is steadfast in righteousness is to life as he who pursues evil is to death. 20 An abomination of Yahweh are the crooked of heart, but his delight are those with blameless ways. 21 Rest assured, the wicked will not go unpunished, but the offspring of the righteous will escape. 22 A ring of gold in the snout of a pig is a woman who is beautiful but without discretion. 23 The desire of the righteous is only good, but the expectation of the wicked, wrath. 24 There is one who gives yet grows richer, but he who withholds what is right only finds need. 25 A person of blessing will be enriched, and he who gives water also will be refreshed.

Proverbs,"1 The wisest of women builds her house, but the foolish tears it down with her hands. 2 He who walks in uprightness fears Yahweh, but he who is devious in his ways displeases him. 3 In the mouth of a fool is the rod of pride, but the lips of the wise preserve them. 4 When there are no oxen the manger is empty, but an abundance of crops comes by the strength of an ox. 5 A faithful witness does not lie, but he who breathes out falsehood is a witness of deceit. 6 A scoffer seeks wisdom, but there is none, but knowledge comes easily to him who understands. 7 Leave the presence of a foolish man, for you will not come to know words of knowledge. 8 The wisdom of the clever is understanding his ways, but the folly of fools is deceit. 9 Fools mock the guilt offering, but among the upright, it is favorable. 10 The heart knows the bitterness of its soul, but in its joy, it will not share itself with a stranger. 11 The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish. 12 There is a way that seems upright to a man, but its end is the way of death. 13 Even in laughter, a heart may be sad, and the end of joy may be grief. 14 From his ways, the perverse of heart will be satisfied, and from his own, so shall a good man. 15 The simple will believe every word, but the clever will consider his step. 16 The wise is cautious and turns from evil, but the fool throws off restraint and is confident. 17 He who is short of temper will act foolishly, and the man who schemes will be hated. 18 The simple are adorned with folly, but the clever are crowned with knowledge. 19 The evil bow down before the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 20 The poor is disliked even by his neighbor, but the lovers of the rich are many. 21 He who despises his neighbor is a sinner, but he who has mercy on the poor blesses him. 22 Have they not erred, those who plan evil? But loyalty and faithfulness belong to those who plan good. 23 In all toil, there is profit, but the talk of lips leads only to poverty. 24 The crown of the wise is their wealth; the folly of fools is folly. 25 He who saves lives is a witness of truth, but he who utters lies is a betrayer. 26 In the fear of Yahweh, there is confidence of strength, and for his children, there will be refuge. 27 The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life, in order to turn from the snares of death. 28 In the multitude of people is the glory of the king, but without a population, a prince is ruined. 29 He who is slow to anger has great understanding, but the hasty of spirit exalts folly. 30 A heart of tranquility is life to the flesh, but causes bones of passion to rot. 31 He who oppresses the poor insults him who made him, but he who has mercy on the poor honors him. 32 By his evildoing, the wicked will be overthrown, and the righteous will find refuge in his death. 33 In the heart of him who has understanding, wisdom rests, but even in the midst of fools it becomes known. 34 Righteousness will exalt a nation, but sin is a reproach to a people. 35 The favor of a king is for the servant who deals wisely, but his wrath will be on him who acts shamefully.

Proverbs,"1 A soft answer will turn away wrath, but a word of trouble will stir anger. 2 The tongue of the wise will dispense knowledge, but the mouth of fools will pour out folly. 3 In every place, the eyes of Yahweh keep watch over the evil and the good. 4 Gentleness of tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it causes a break in spirit. 5 A fool will despise the instruction of his father, but he who guards reproof is prudent. 6 In the house of the righteous there is much treasure, but the income of the wicked brings trouble. 7 The lips of the wise will spread knowledge, but the heart of fools, not so. 8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination of Yahweh, but the prayer of the upright is his delight. 9 An abomination of Yahweh is the way of the wicked, but he who pursues righteousness he will love. 10 Severe discipline belongs to him who forsakes the way; he who hates a rebuke will die. 11 Sheol and Abaddon are before Yahweh, how much more the hearts of the children of men! 12 A scoffer does not like his rebuke; to the wise he will not go. 13 A heart of gladness will make good countenance, but in sorrow of heart a spirit is broken. 14 The heart of him who understands will seek knowledge, but the faces of fools, they will feed on folly. 15 All the days of the poor are hard, but goodness of heart is a continuous feast. 16 Better is little with the fear of Yahweh than great treasure and trouble with it. 17 Better is a dinner of vegetables when love is there than a fattened ox and hatred with it. 18 A man who is hot-tempered will stir up strife, but he who is slow to anger, he will calm contention. 19 The way of the lazy is like a hedge of thorns, but the path of the upright is a highway. 20 A child of wisdom will make a father glad, but a foolish person, he despises his mother. 21 Folly is a joy to him who lacks sense, and a person of understanding will walk upright. 22 Plans go wrong when there is no counsel, but with many advisors it will succeed. 23 Joy belongs to a man with answers in his mouth, and a word in its time, how good it is! 24 The path of life leads upward for him who has insight, in order to turn away from Sheol below. 25 The house of the proud, Yahweh will tear it down, but he will maintain the property line of the widow. 26 Plans of evil are an abomination of Yahweh, but gracious words are pure. 27 He who makes trouble for his house is he who is greedy for unjust gain, but he who hates bribes will live. 28 A heart of righteousness will ponder the answer, but a mouth of wickedness will pour out deceit. 29 Yahweh is far from the wicked, but the prayers of the righteous he will hear. 30 From the light of the eyes, the heart will rejoice, and good news will enliven the bones. 31 The ear of him who listens to admonitions of life, in the midst of the wise it will lodge. 32 He who ignores instruction despises himself, but he who hears admonition gains heart. 33 Fear of Yahweh is the instruction of the wise, and before honor comes humility.

And getting understanding: it is chosen over silver. 17 The highway of the upright, it turns from evil, he who guards himself keeps his way. 18 Before destruction comes pride, and before a fall, a haughty spirit. 19 Better a lowly spirit with the poor than dividing the spoil with the proud. 20 He who is attentive to a matter will find goodness, and he who trusts in Yahweh, his own happiness. 21 The wise of heart is called perceptive, but he who is pleasant of lips will increase persuasiveness. 22 A fountain of life is wisdom for its owner, but the instruction of fools is folly. 23 The heart of the wise will make his mouth judicious, and upon his lips, it will add persuasiveness. 24 Pleasant sayings are a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and healing to the bones. 25 There is a way that seems upright to a man, but its end is the way of death. 26 The life of a worker works for him, for his hunger urges him. 27 A man of wickedness concocts evil, and his lips are like a scorching fire. 28 A person of perversity will spread dissent, and he who whispers separates a close friend. 29 A person of violence will entice his neighbor and cause him to walk on a way that is not good. 30 He who winks his eyes does so in order to plan perverse things; he who purses his lips will bring evil to pass. 31 A crown of glory is gray hair; by a righteous life it is gained. 32 He who is slow to anger is better than him who is mighty, and he who controls his spirit than him who captures a city. 33 The lot will be cast into the lap, but all of its decisions are from Yahweh.

Proverbs,"1 Better a dry morsel and quiet with it than a house filled with feasts of strife. 2 A slave who deals wisely will rule over a child who acts shamefully, and in the midst of brothers he will share his inheritance. 3 A crucible is for the silver, and a furnace is for the gold, but Yahweh will test hearts. 4 He who does evil listens to lips of wickedness, and the liar gives heed to the tongue of mischief. 5 He who mocks the poor insults him who made him; he who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished. 6 The crown of the elderly are grandchildren, and the glory of children is their fathers. 7 Fine speech is not becoming a fool, still less is false speech for a ruler. 8 The bribe is a stone of magic in the eyes of its owner; everywhere he will turn, he will prosper. 9 He who forgives an affront fosters love, but he who waits on a matter will alienate a friend. 10 A rebuke strikes him who understands deeper than one hundred blows to a fool. 11 An evil person will seek only rebellion, and a cruel messenger will be sent against him. 12 May a man meet a she-bear robbed of offspring and not a fool in his folly. 13 For he who returns evil for good, evil will not depart from his house. 14 Like the release of water is the beginning of strife; before it breaks out, stop the quarrel. 15 He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous, the two of them are both abominations of Yahweh. 16 Why is this? A price in the hand of a fool, in order to buy wisdom where there is no sense. 17 The friend loves at all times, but a brother is born for adversity. 18 A person who lacks sense pledges; he becomes security before his neighbor. 19 He who loves transgression loves strife; he who builds his high thresholds seeks destruction. 20 He who is crooked of heart will not find goodness, and he who is perverse, by his tongue he will fall into calamity. 21 He who begets a fool, there is trouble for him; the father of a fool will not rejoice. 22 A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a downcast spirit will dry out bones. 23 The wicked will accept a bribe from the lap, in order to pervert the ways of justice. 24 He who understands sets his face toward wisdom, but the eyes of a fool, to the end of the earth. 25 A grief to his father is the child of a fool, and bitterness to her who bore him. 26 Also, imposing a fine on the righteous is not good, nor to flog nobles for uprightness. 27 He who spares his sayings knows knowledge, and a cool spirit is a man of understanding. 28 Even a fool who keeps silent shall be considered wise; he who closes his lips is intelligent.

Proverbs,"1 He who is selfish seeks a craving; against all sound judgment he shows contempt. 2 A fool will not take pleasure in understanding, but in expressing his heart. 3 With the coming of wickedness comes contempt also, and with dishonor, disgrace. 4 Deep waters are words of the mouth of a man; a gushing stream is a fountain of wisdom. 5 Being partial to faces of evil is not good, nor to subvert the righteous at the judgment. 6 The lips of a fool will bring strife, and his mouth calls out for a flogging. 7 The mouth of a fool is ruin to him, and his lips are a snare to his soul. 8 The words of a whisper are like delicious morsels, and they themselves go down to inner parts of the body. 9 Even he who is slack in his work, he is brother to a master of destruction. 10 A tower of strength is the name of Yahweh; into him the righteous will run and be safe. 11 The wealth of the rich is his strong city, and like a wall, it is high in his imagination. 12 In the presence of destruction, the heart of a man will be haughty, but in the presence of honor, humble. 13 He who returns a word before he will hear, folly itself belongs to him as well as shame. 14 The spirit of a man will endure his sickness, but a broken spirit, who may bear it? 15 An intelligent mind will acquire knowledge, and the ear of the wise will seek knowledge. 16 The gift of a person will open doors for him, and before the great, it gives him access. 17 The first in his dispute is deemed righteous, but his neighbor will come and examine him. 18 The lot will put an end to disputes, and between powerful contenders it will decide. 19 A brother who is offended is worse than a city of strength, and quarrels are like the bars of a fortification. 20 From the fruit of a man’s mouth, his stomach will be satisfied, as for the yield of his lips, it will satisfy. 21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love her will eat of her fruit. 22 He who finds a wife finds good, and he will obtain favor from Yahweh. 23 The poor may speak entreaties, but the rich will answer roughly. 24 A man of many friends will come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

Proverbs,"1 Better a poor person walking in integrity than one who is perverse in his speech and is a fool. 2 Also, a life without knowledge is not good, and he who moves quickly with his feet misses the mark. 3 As for the folly of humankind, its way leads to ruin, and against Yahweh his heart will rage. 4 Wealth adds many friends, but the poor will be left by his friends. 5 A witness of falsehood will not go unpunished, and he who breathes lies will not escape. 6 Many will seek favor before the generous, and everyone is the friend of a man of gifts. 7 All the brothers of the poor, if they hate him, how much more will his friends keep away from him. He pursues them with words, and they are gone. 8 He who acquires wisdom loves himself; he who guards understanding loves to find good. 9 A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who breathes lies will perish. 10 For a fool living in luxury is not fitting, any more than it is for a slave to rule over princes. 11 The understanding of a person makes him slow to his anger, and his glory overlooks offense. 12 The rage of a king growls like a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass. 13 A foolish child is a ruin to his father, and the quarreling of a woman is a continuous dripping. 14 A house and wealth are an inheritance from fathers, but from Yahweh comes a woman who is prudent. 15 Laziness will bring on a deep sleep, and a person of idleness will suffer hunger. 16 He who guards commandments guards his life; he who is careless of his ways will be killed. 17 He who lends to Yahweh is he who is kind to the poor, and his benefits he will repay to him. 18 Discipline your child, for there is hope, but on his destruction do not set your desire. 19 A hot-tempered person pays a penalty; if you rescue him, you will do it yet again. 20 Listen to advice and accept instruction so that you will gain wisdom for your future. 21 Many plans are in the heart of a man, but the purpose of Yahweh will be established. 22 The craving of a man is his steadfast loyalty, and it is better to be poor than a liar. 23 Fear of Yahweh leads to life; he who is filled with it will rest—he will not suffer harm. 24 A lazy person buries his hand in the dish, and even to his mouth he will not bring it back. 25 The scoffer you shall strike, and the simple, may they learn prudence, and reprove the intelligent and he will gain knowledge. 26 He who does violence to a father, he who chases away a mother, is a child who causes shame and brings reproach. 27 Cease to listen to instruction, my child, and you will stray from sayings of knowledge. 28 A worthless witness will mock justice, and the mouth of the wicked will devour iniquity. 29 Judgments are prepared for the scoffers, and flogging for the back of fools.

Proverbs,"1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, and any who go astray by it are not wise. 2 Roaring like the lion is the dreaded anger of a king; he who provokes him forfeits his life. 3 It is honorable for the man to refrain from strife, but every fool will be quick to quarrel. 4 The lazy person will not plow in season; he will expect at the harvest, but there will be nothing. 5 Deep waters are like purpose in the heart of a man, and a man of understanding will draw it out. 6 Many a person will proclaim his loyalty for himself, but a man who is trustworthy, who can find? 7 He who walks in his integrity is righteous; happy are his children who follow him. 8 A king who sits on the throne of judgment winnows all evil with his eyes. 9 Who will say “I have made my heart clean; I am pure from my sin”? 10 Stone and stone, measure and measure, both of them are an abomination of Yahweh. 11 Even by his acts, a young man will make himself known, whether his acts are pure and upright. 12 The ear that hears and the eye that sees, Yahweh has made them both. 13 Do not love sleep, lest you become poor; open your eyes and have plenty bread. 14 “Bad, bad,” the buyer will say, but when one goes to him, then he will boast. 15 There is gold and many costly stones, but precious jewels are lips of knowledge. 16 Take his garment, for he has given security to a stranger, and on behalf of a foreigner—take it as pledge. 17 Bread gained by deceit is sweet for the man, but afterward, his mouth will be filled with gravel. 18 A plan will be established by advice, and with guidance make war. 19 He reveals a secret, he who walks about with gossip, and do not associate with a babbler’s lips. 20 He who curses his father and his mother, his lamp will be extinguished in the midst of darkness. 21 An inheritance acquired hastily at the beginning will not be blessed at its end. 22 Do not say “I will repay evil”; wait for Yahweh and he will deliver you. 23 An abomination of Yahweh is a stone and a weight, and scales of falsehood are not good. 24 Away from Yahweh are the steps of a strong man, and how will humankind understand his ways? 25 It is a snare to humankind to say rashly “It is holy,” and after vows, to scrutinize. 26 A wise king winnows the wicked, and he will drive a wheel over them. 27 The lamp of Yahweh is the spirit of humankind, he who searches every innermost part. 28 Loyalty and faithfulness will preserve a king, and he is upheld with the righteousness of his throne. 29 The glory of young men is their strength, but the beauty of the aged is gray hair. 30 The blows of a wound will cleanse evil, as will beatings of the innermost part.

Proverbs,"1 Streams of water are the heart of a king in the hand of Yahweh; wherever he will desire, he will turn. 2 Every way of a man is upright in his own eyes, but Yahweh weighs hearts. 3 Doing righteousness and justice is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice. 4 Haughtiness of the eyes and pride of heart, the lamp of the wicked are sin. 5 The plans of the diligent only lead to abundance, but all who are hasty, only to want. 6 He who makes treasure by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and seeker of death. 7 The violence of the wicked will sweep them away, for they refuse to do justice. 8 Crooked is the way of a man and a foreigner, but the pure is upright in his conduct. 9 Better to dwell on the corner of a roof than to share a house with a woman of contention. 10 The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor will not find mercy in his eyes. 11 With the punishment of a scoffer, the simple will become wise, and with the instruction of the wise, he will obtain knowledge. 12 The righteous observes the house of the wicked; he throws the wicked to ruin. 13 He who closes his ear from the cry of the poor, he also will cry out and not be heard. 14 A gift in secret will avert anger, and a concealed bribe, strong wrath. 15 It is a joy to the righteous to do justice, but dismay to those who do evil. 16 Whoever wanders from the way of understanding, in the assembly of the dead he will rest. 17 A man of want is he who loves pleasure; he who loves wine and oil will not become rich. 18 A ransom for the righteous is the wicked, and the faithless instead of the upright. 19 Better to live in a land of wilderness than with a wife of quarrels and provocation. 20 Precious treasure and oil are in the house of the wise, but the foolish person will devour them. 21 He who pursues righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness, and honor. 22 To a city of warriors, the wise ascends, and he will bring down the stronghold—its object of trust.

Proverbs,"22 To a city of warriors, the wise ascends, and he will bring down the stronghold—its object of trust. 23 He who guards his mouth and his tongue, he guards his life from danger. 24 The proud, haughty one: “scoffer” is his name; he acts with arrogance of pride. 25 The craving of a lazy person will kill him, for his hands refuse to work. 26 All day he craves a craving, but the righteous will give and not hold back. 27 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he brings it in divisiveness! 28 A false witness will perish, but a man who listens will testify with success. 29 A wicked man is strong in his countenance, but the upright will appoint his paths. 30 There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel to oppose Yahweh. 31 A horse is prepared for the day of battle, but to Yahweh belongs the victory. 1 A reputation is to be chosen rather than great riches; favor is better than silver and gold. 2 Rich and poor have much in common; Yahweh is the maker of all of them. 3 The clever sees danger and hides, but the simple go on and suffer. 4 The reward of humility is the fear of Yahweh— wealth and honor and life. 5 Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse; he who guards himself will keep away from them. 6 Train the child concerning his way; even when he is old, he will not stray from it. 7 The rich will rule over the poor, and the borrower is a slave of the lender. 8 He who sows injustice will reap calamity, and the rod of his anger will fail. 9 He who is generous will be blessed, for he gives to the poor from his own bread. 10 Drive out a scoffer and strife will go out; quarrel and abuse will cease. 11 He who loves purity of heart and has gracious speech, his friend is the king. 12 The eyes of Yahweh keep watch over knowledge, but he will overthrow the words of the faithless. 13 A lazy person says “A lion in the street! In the middle of the highway, I shall be killed!” 14 A deep pit is the mouth of an adulteress, he with whom Yahweh is angry will fall there. 15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a boy; the rod of discipline will drive it from him. 16 He who oppresses the poor in order to enrich himself, or gives to the rich, will come to poverty. 17 Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise; you shall apply your heart to my teaching. 18 For it is pleasant if you guard them within you; together they will be ready upon your lips. 19 In order for your trust to be in Yahweh, I have made them known to you today—even you. 20 Have I not written for you thirty sayings with admonitions and knowledge? 21 In order to show you what is right—sayings of truth— in order to return a true saying to him who sent you. 22 Do not rob the poor because he is poor, and do not crush the afflicted at the gate; 23 For Yahweh will plead their case and despoil those who despoil them of life. 24 Do not befriend an owner of anger, and with a man of wrath you shall not associate; 25 lest you learn his way and become entangled in a snare to yourself. 26 Do not be with those who give a pledge by becoming surety. 27 If there is nothing for you to pay, why will he take your bed from under you?

Proverbs,"28 Do not remove an ancient boundary marker which your ancestors made. 29 A man who is skillful in his work, you shall see: before kings, he will serve; he will not serve before the commoners. 1 When you sit to eat with a ruler, you shall surely observe what is before you, 2 and you shall put a knife to your throat if you have a big appetite. 3 Do not desire his delicacies, for it is food of deception. 4 Do not tire in order to become rich; out of your understanding, may you desist. 5 Your eyes will alight on it, but there is nothing to it, for suddenly it will make for itself wings like an eagle and it will be exhausted in the heavens. 6 Do not eat the bread of the stingy, and do not desire his delicacies. 7 For, like hair in his throat, so it is. “Eat and drink!” he will say to you, but his heart will not be with you. 8 Your morsel you have eaten, you will vomit it up, and you will waste your pleasant words. 9 In the ears of a fool do not speak, for he will despise the wisdom of your words. 10 Do not remove an ancient boundary marker, and on the fields of orphans do not encroach; 11 For their redeemer is strong, he himself will plead their cause against you. 12 Apply your heart to instruction, and your ear to sayings of knowledge. 13 Do not withhold discipline from a child, if you will beat him with the rod, he will not die. 14 As for you, with the rod you shall beat him, and his life you will save from Sheol. 15 My child, if your heart is wise, my heart will be glad—even me! 16 And my insides will rejoice when your lips speak what is upright. 17 May your heart not envy the sinners, but live in fear of Yahweh all day. 18 Surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off. 19 You, my child, hear and be wise, and direct your heart on the road. 20 Do not be among drinkers of wine, among gluttonous eaters of their meat. 21 For the drunkard and gluttonous, they will become poor, and with rags, drowsiness will clothe them. 22 Listen to your father—he who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old. 23 Buy truth and do not sell it, wisdom and instruction and understanding. 24 The father of the righteous will surely rejoice; he who bears a wise person will be happy with him. 25 May your father and your mother be glad, and may she who bore you rejoice. 26 My child, may you give your heart to me, and may your eyes delight in my ways. 27 For a deep pit is a prostitute, and a narrow well is an adulteress. 28 She is also like a robber lying in wait, and the faithless among mankind she increases. 29 To whom is woe? To whom is sorrow? To whom are quarrels? To whom is complaint? To whom are wounds without cause? To whom is redness of the eyes? 30 To those who linger over wine, to those who come to try mixed wine. 31 Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles on the cup, going down smoothly. 32 In the end, it will bite like a serpent, and it will sting like an adder. 33 Your eyes will see strange things, and your heart will speak perverse things. 34 And you will be like him who lies down in the heart of the sea, and like him who lies down on top of a mast. 35 “They struck me; I was not hurt.

Proverbs,"1 Do not envy men of evil, and do not desire to be with them. 2 For their minds will devise violence, and their lips will speak mischief. 3 By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established. 4 And by knowledge, rooms are filled with all riches, precious and pleasant. 5 The warrior of wisdom is in strength, and a man of knowledge is strong in power. 6 For with wise guidance you shall make war for yourself, and victory is in an abundance of counsel. 7 Wisdom is too high for fools; at the gate he will not open his mouth. 8 He who plans to do evil for himself, they will call him “master of mischief.” 9 Devising folly is a sin, and an abomination to humankind is a scoffer. 10 If you faint on the day of adversity, little is your strength. 11 Rescue those who are led away to the death and those who stagger to the slaughter. If you hold back, 12 if you say, “Look, we do not know this,” does not he who weighs hearts perceive it? And he who keeps your soul, he knows and will repay humankind according to his deeds. 13 My child, eat honey, for it is good, and the dripping of the honeycomb is sweet to your taste. 14 Thus know wisdom for the sake of your soul, if you find it, then there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off. 15 Do not lie in wait like an outlaw against the home of the righteous; do not do violence to his dwelling place. 16 For seven times the righteous will fall, but he will rise, but the wicked will be overthrown by calamity. 17 While your enemies are falling, do not rejoice; when he trips himself, may your heart not be glad 18 lest Yahweh see and it be evil in his eyes, and turn his anger away from him. 19 Do not fret because of the evildoers; do not envy the wicked. 20 For there will not be a future for the evil; the lamp of the wicked will die out. 21 Fear Yahweh, my son, and the king; with those who change, do not associate. 22 For suddenly their disaster will come, and the ruin of both of them, who knows? 23 These sayings are also for the wise: Partiality in judgment is not good. 24 Whoever says to the guilty, “You are righteous,” the people will curse him; the nations will abhor him. 25 But they who rebuke will have delight, and upon them blessings of goodness will come. 26 He will kiss the lips, he who gives an honest answer. 27 Prepare your work in the street and get it ready for yourself in the field; afterward, then you shall build your house. 28 Do not be a witness without cause against your neighbor nor deceive with your lips. 29 Do not say, “Just as he has done to me, so shall I do to him; I will pay back the man according to his deed.” 30 I passed by the field of a lazy person, and over the vineyard of a person lacking sense; 31 and behold, it was overgrown—all of it was covered with thorns, its surface with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down. 32 Then I myself saw and my heart considered; I looked, and I took hold of instruction: 33 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands for rest, 34 and your poverty will come running, and your lack like an armed warrior.

Proverbs,"1 These are also proverbs of Solomon which officials of Hezekiah king of Judah copied: 2 The glory of God conceals things, but the glory of kings searches out things. 3 As heaven is to height and the earth is to depth, so is the heart of kings—there is no searching. 4 Remove the dross from silver, and it will become a vessel for the smith. 5 Remove the wicked before a king, and his throne will be established in righteousness. 6 Do not promote yourself before the king, and in the place of the great ones do not stand. 7 For it is better that he say to you, “Ascend here,” than he humble you before a noble. What your eyes have seen, 8 do not hastily bring out to court, for what will you do at its end, when your neighbor puts you to shame? 9 Argue your argument with your neighbor himself, the secret of another do not disclose, 10 lest he who hears shame you and your ill repute will not end. 11 Apples of gold in a setting of silver is a matter spoken at its proper time. 12 A ring of gold and an ornament of fine gold is a rebuke of the wise to the ear of a listener. 13 Like the cold of snow on a day of harvest is a faithful messenger to those who send him, and the soul of his master is refreshed. 14 Like clouds and wind when there is no rain, so too is a man who boasts in a gift of deception. 15 With patience a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue will break a bone. 16 If you find honey, eat what is sufficient for you, lest you have your fill of it and vomit it out. 17 Make your foot scarce in the house of your neighbor, lest he become weary of you and hate you. 18 Like a club and sword and a sharp arrow is a man who bears false witness against his neighbor. 19 A bad tooth and a lame foot is the trust of a faithless person in a time of trouble. 20 Like one who removes a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar on natron, is he who sings songs to a heavy heart. 21 If your enemy is hungry, feed him bread, and if thirsty, let him drink water. 22 For coals of fire you will heap upon his head, and Yahweh will reward you. 23 The wind of the north produces rain, and a backbiting tongue, angry faces. 24 Better to live upon the corner of a roof than with a woman of contention and in a shared house. 25 Like cold water upon a weary soul, so too is good news from a distant place.

There is more hope for a fool than for him. 13 A lazy person says “A lion is in the road! A lion among the streets!” 14 The door turns on its hinge, and a lazy person on his bed. 15 A lazy person buries his hands in the dish; he is too tired to return it to his mouth. 16 A lazy person is wiser in his eyes than seven who answer discreetly. 17 Grabbing onto the ears of a dog passing by is one who meddles in a quarrel that is not his own. 18 Like a maniac who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death, 19 so is a man who deceives his neighbor, but says “Am I not joking?” 20 For lack of wood, a fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, quarreling will cease. 21 As charcoal is to hot embers and wood is to fire, so a man of quarrels is to kindling strife. 22 The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels, and they go down to the inner parts of the body.

Proverbs,"23 Like impure silver which overlays an earthen vessel, so are smooth lips and an evil heart. 24 On his lips, an enemy will pretend, but inside he will harbor deceit. 25 When he makes his voice gracious, do not believe him, for seven abominations are in his heart. 26 Though hatred is covered with guile, its evil will be exposed in the assembly. 27 He who digs a pit, in it he will fall, and he who rolls a stone, on him it will come back. 28 A tongue of deceit hates its victim, and a flattering mouth makes ruin. 1 Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what the day will bring. 2 May another praise you and not your own mouth, a stranger and not your own lips. 3 Heavy is a stone and weighty is sand, but the provocation of a fool is heavier than both of them. 4 Cruel is wrath and overwhelming is anger, but who will stand before jealousy? 5 Better a rebuke that is open than a love that is hidden. 6 The wounds of a friend mean well, but the kisses of an enemy are profane. 7 An appetite that is sated spurns honey, but to an appetite that is ravenous, all bitterness is sweet. 8 Like a bird that strays from its nest, so is a man who strays from his place. 9 Perfume and incense will gladden a heart, and the pleasantness of one’s friend is personal advice. 10 As for your friend and a friend of your father, do not forsake them, and the house of your brother, do not enter on the day of your calamity. Better is a close neighbor than a distant brother. 11 Be wise, my child, and make my heart glad, and I will answer him who reproaches me with a word. 12 When the clever sees danger, he hides; the simple go on and suffer. 13 Take his garment, for he gives surety to a stranger, and to an adulteress—so take his pledge. 14 He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, a curse will be reckoned to him. 15 Dripping constantly on a day of heavy rain and a woman of contention are alike. 16 In restraining her, he restrains wind, and his right hand will grasp oil. 17 As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another. 18 He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who guards his master will be honored. 19 As the waters reflect face to face, so the heart of a person reflects the person. 20 Sheol and Abaddon will not be satisfied, and the eyes of a person will not be satisfied either. 21 A crucible is for the silver, and a furnace for the gold, but a man is tested by the mouth of him who praises him. 22 If you crush a fool in the mortar with the pestle along with the crushed grain, it will not drive folly from upon him. 23 You will surely know the condition of your flock; your heart attends to the herds. 24 For riches are not forever, nor a crown for generation after generation. 25 When the grass is gone, then green growth will appear, and the herbs of the mountains will be gathered. 26 Lambs will be your clothing, and goats the price of the field. 27 And there will be enough goats’ milk for your food, for the food of your household and the nourishment of your maidservants.

Proverbs,"1 The wicked flee, but no one pursues, but the righteous is bold like a lion. 2 By the rebellion of a land, her rulers increase, but by a person of intelligence who knows justice, it will last. 3 A man who is poor and oppresses the impoverished is a beating rain that leaves no food. 4 Those who forsake instruction will praise the wicked, but they who guard instruction will struggle against them. 5 Men of evil do not understand justice, but seekers of Yahweh understand completely. 6 Better to be poor and walking in one’s integrity than to be crooked of ways when one is rich. 7 He who keeps instruction is a child of understanding, but the companion of gluttons will shame his father. 8 He who augments his wealth with interest and with usury gathers it for him who is kind to the poor. 9 He who turns his ear from listening to instruction, even his prayer is an abomination. 10 He who misleads the upright onto the way of evil, into his pits he will fall. But as for the blameless, they will inherit good. 11 A man of wealth is wise in his own eyes, but the intelligent poor sees through him. 12 When the righteous triumphs, great is the glory, but with the rising of the wicked, a person will be hidden. 13 He who conceals his transgression will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes will obtain mercy. 14 Happy is the person who fears continuously, but he who is stubborn of heart, will fall into calamity. 15 Like a roaring lion and a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a poor people. 16 A ruler who lacks understanding is a cruel oppressor, but those who hate unjust gain will have long days. 17 A person who is burdened with the blood of another, until death he will flee; do not take hold of him. 18 He who walks in integrity will be safe, but he who takes crooked paths will fall in one. 19 He who tills his ground will have plenty bread, but he who follows fantasies will have plenty of poverty. 20 A man of faithfulness has abundant blessings, but he who hurries to become rich will not go unpunished. 21 Showing partiality is not good, and over a morsel of bread, a strong man will do wrong. 22 He who hurries for wealth is a man with an evil eye, but he does not know that poverty will come upon him. 23 He who rebukes a person will afterward find more favor than he who flatters with the tongue. 24 He who robs his father and his mother and says, “There is no crime,” is partner to a man who corrupts. 25 The greedy person will stir up strife, but he who trusts in Yahweh will be enriched. 26 He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom will be saved. 27 For he who gives to the poor, there is no lacking, but for he who turns his eyes, there are many curses. 28 With the rising of the wicked, humankind will be hidden, and with their perishing, the righteous will multiply. 1 A man who is reproved, being stubborn of neck— suddenly he will be broken, and there will not be healing. 2 When the righteous are numerous, the people will rejoice, but when the wicked are ruling, people will groan. 3 A man who loves wisdom will make his parents glad, but the friend of prostitutes will squander his wealth. 4 By justice a king gives stability to a land, but a man of bribes will ruin it.

Proverbs,"5 A strong man who flatters his neighbor is spreading a net for his feet. 6 In transgression, an evil man is a snare, but the righteous will sing and rejoice. 7 The righteous knows the case of the poor, but the wicked does not understand knowledge. 8 Men of scoffing set a city aflame, but the wise turn away wrath. 9 If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man, then there is rankling and ridicule, but there is no relief. 10 Men of blood hate the blameless, and they seek the life of the upright. 11 A fool gives all his breath, but the wise holds back in quiet. 12 A ruler listening to a word of falsehood, all his officials are wicked. 13 The poor and a man of oppression have this in common: Yahweh gives light to the eyes of them both. 14 A king who judges with truthfulness to the poor, his throne will be established forever. 15 As for a rod and reproof, they will give wisdom, but a neglected child is disgraced by his mother. 16 With the increase of the wicked, transgression will increase, but the righteous will look on his downfall. 17 Discipline your children, and they will give you rest, and they will give delight to your soul. 18 When there is no prophecy, the people cast off restraint, but as for he who guards instruction, happiness is his. 19 By words, a servant is not disciplined, for he will understand, but there is no giving heed. 20 You see a man who is hasty in his words: there is more hope for a fool than him. 21 He who pampers his servant from childhood, arrogance will be his end. 22 A man of anger will stir strife, and the owner of anger, much transgression. 23 The pride of a person will bring him humiliation, and the lowly of spirit will obtain honor. 24 Being a partner with a thief is hating one’s life; a curse he will hear, but not disclose. 25 The fear of a person will lay a snare, but he who trusts in Yahweh will be secure. 26 Many are those who seek the favor of a ruler, but from Yahweh one obtains justice. 27 A man of injustice is an abomination to the righteous, but the upright is an abomination to the wicked. 1 The words of Agur, son of Yakeh, the oracle. Thus says the man to Ithiel, to Ithiel, and Ucal: 2 Certainly I am more stupid than a man, and the understanding of humankind is not for me. 3 And I have not learned wisdom, nor will I know knowledge of the Holy One. 4 Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in the hollow of his hand? Who has wrapped water in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name and what is the name of his child? For surely you know. 5 Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield for him who takes refuge in him. 6 Do not add to his words lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar. 7 Two things I ask from you; do not deny me before I die: 8 Keep falsehood and a lying word far from me; do not give me poverty or wealth; provide me with food only for my need. 9 Or else I will be satisfied and will deny him and say “Who is Yahweh?” Or I will be poor and will steal and profane the name of my God. 10 Do not slander a servant to his master, or else he will curse you and you will be guilty. 11 There is a generation that will curse its father, and its mother it will not bless. 12 There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes, but from its filthiness it will not be cleansed. 13 There is a generation—how lofty are their eyes! And their eyelids they will lift. 14 There is a generation whose teeth are swords, and its jawbones, knives, in order to devour the poor from the earth and the needy from humankind. 15 For the leech, there are two daughters; “Give, give!” they cry. As for three of these, they are not satisfied; as for four, they do not say enough. 16 Sheol and barrenness of womb, the land is not satisfied with water, and fire does not say “enough!” 17 The eye that mocks a father and scorns the obedience of a mother— the ravens of the valley will peck it out, and the offspring of vultures will eat it. 18 Three of these are too wonderful for me, and four, I do not understand them: 19 the way of the eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship in the heart of the sea, and the way of a man with a young woman.

Proverbs,"20 This is the way of a woman committing adultery: she eats and wipes her mouth, and says “I have not done wrong.” 21 Under three things the earth trembles, and under four, it is not able to bear up: 22 under a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when he is satisfied with food; 23 under an unloved woman when she gets married, and a maid when she succeeds her mistress. 24 There are four small things on the earth, and they are exceedingly wise: 25 The ants are a people who are not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer; 26 the badgers are a people who are not mighty, yet they set their house on the rock; 27 there is no king for the locust, yet it marches in rank; 28 a lizard you can seize with hands, yet it is in palaces of kings. 29 There are three things that are magnificent of stride, and four that are magnificent when moving: 30 a mighty lion among the beasts, but he will not turn back from any face; 31 a strutting rooster or he-goat, and a king whose army is with him. 32 If you have been foolish by exalting yourself, and if you have devised evil, put your hand to your mouth. 33 For pressing milk produces curd, and pressing the nose produces blood, so pressing anger produces strife. 1 The words of Lemuel, the king—an oracle that his mother taught him: 2 What, my son? And what, my son in my womb? And what, son of my vows? 3 Do not give your strength to the women, and your ways to destroy kings. 4 It is not for the kings, O Lemuel; drinking wine is not for the kings, nor is strong drink for rulers. 5 Or else he will drink and forget what has been decreed, and he will pervert the rights of all the afflicted. 6 Give strong drink to him who is perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress. 7 He will drink and forget his poverty, and his misery he will not remember any more. 8 Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all the needy. 9 Open your mouth, judge righteousness, and defend the poor and needy. 10 A woman of excellence, who will find? For her worth is far more than precious jewels. 11 The heart of her husband trusts in her, and gain he will not lack. 12 She does him good, but not harm all the days of her life. 13 She seeks wool and flax, and she works with the diligence of her hands. 14 She is like the ships of a merchant; from far off she brings her food; 15 And she arises while it is still night, and gives food to her household, and tasks to her servant girls. 16 She considers a field and buys it, from the fruit of her hand she plants a vineyard. 17 She girds her waist in strength, and makes her arms strong. 18 She perceives that her merchandise is good; her lamp does not go out in the night. 19 Her hands she puts onto the distaff, and her palms hold a spindle. 20 Her palm she opens to the poor, and her hand she reaches out to the needy. 21 She does not fear for her house when it snows, for her entire household is clothed in crimson. 22 She makes for herself coverings; her clothing is fine linen and purple. 23 Her husband is known at the gates, in his seat among the elders of the land. 24 Linen garments she makes and sells, and she supplies sashes for the merchants. 25 Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the future. 26 She opens her mouth with wisdom, and instruction of kindness is upon her tongue. 27 She looks after the ways of her household, and the bread of idleness she will not eat. 28 Her children rise and consider her happy, her husband also, and he praises her; 29 “Many daughters have done excellence, but you surpass all of them.” 30 Charm is deceit and beauty is vain; but a woman who fears Yahweh shall be praised. 31 Give to her from the fruit of her hand, and may they praise her works in the city gates.

Their name you have blotted out forever and ever. 6 The enemies are destroyed in ruins forever, and you have uprooted their cities; their very memory has perished. 7 But Yahweh sits enthroned forever. He has established his throne for judgment. 8 And he will judge the world with righteousness. He will judge the peoples with equity. 9 And Yahweh will be a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of distress. 10 And those who know your name will trust in you, for you do not forsake those who seek you, O Yahweh. 11 Sing praises to Yahweh who sits enthroned in Zion. Tell his deeds among the peoples, 12 for he who avenges bloodshed remembers them. He does not forget the distressed cry of the afflicted. 13 Be gracious to me, O Yahweh. See my suffering from those who hate me, you who lift me up from the gates of death, 14 so that I may tell of all your praises. In the gates of the daughter of Zion let me rejoice in your salvation. 15 The nations have fallen in the pit that they made; their foot is caught in the net that they hid. 16 Yahweh has made himself known; he has executed judgment.

For the music director. Of David, the servant of Yahweh, who spoke to Yahweh the words of this song when Yahweh delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. 1 And he said: “I love you, O Yahweh, my strength.” 2 Yahweh is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock in whom I have taken refuge, my shield and the horn of my deliverance, my stronghold. 3 I called upon Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised, and I was saved from my enemies. 4 The ropes of death encircled me, and streams of ruin overwhelmed me. 5 The ropes of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me. 6 In my trouble I called on Yahweh, and to my God I cried for help. He heard my voice from his temple, and my cry for help came up before his presence into his ears. 7 Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains trembled, and they staggered because he was angry. 8 Smoke went forth from his nose, and fire from his mouth consumed. Burning coals blazed from him. 9 So he bowed the heavens and came down with a thick cloud under his feet. 10 And he mounted a cherub and flew, and he swooped down on wings of wind. 11 He made darkness his hiding place; all about him his covering was a darkness of waters, thick clouds. 12 From the brightness before him his clouds passed over with hail and coals of fire. 13 And Yahweh thundered from the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice with hail and coals of fire. 14 And he shot his arrows and scattered them, and many lightning bolts and routed them. 15 Then the channels of the sea became visible, and the foundations of the world were uncovered by your rebuke, O Yahweh, by the blast of the wind of your nose. 16 He reached from on high; he seized me. He drew me from many waters. 17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me because they were stronger than I. 18 They confronted me on the day of disaster, but Yahweh was my support. 19 So he brought me out to a spacious place. He delivered me because he delighted in me. 20 Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands he has repaid me. 21 Because I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not acted wickedly against my God, 22 because all his ordinances are before me, and his statutes I have not removed from me, 23 and I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from my guilt. 24 Therefore Yahweh has repaid me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. 25 To the loyal you show yourself loyal. To the blameless you show yourself blameless. 26 To the pure you show yourself pure. but to the wicked you show yourself shrewd. 27 For you deliver humble people, but haughty eyes you humiliate. 28 For you light my lamp; Yahweh, my God, lights up my darkness. 29 For with you I can charge a troop, and with my God I can scale a wall. 30 This God—his way is blameless. The word of Yahweh is flawless. He is a shield for all those who take refuge in him. 31 For who is God apart from Yahweh, and who is a rock except our God? 32 The God who girded me with strength, and made safe my way, 33 he made my feet like the deer’s, and on my high places he makes me stand. 34 He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. 35 You also gave me the shield of your salvation, and your right hand supported me, and your humility made me great. 36 You enlarged my step under me, and my ankles did not slip. 37 I chased my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back until they were finished off. 38 I struck them and they were not able to stand up; they fell under my feet. 39 And you girded me with strength for the battle; those rising against me you made to kneel under me. 40 And you made my enemies turn their backs, then I destroyed those who hated me. 41 They cried out but there was no rescuer, even to Yahweh, but he did not answer them. 42 And I ground them like dust in the wind, I emptied them out like mud of the streets. 43 You rescued me from strife with people; you set me as head (over) nations. People I did not know served me; 44 as soon as they heard, they obeyed me. The children of a foreign land feigned obedience before me. 45 The children of a foreign land lost heart, and they came trembling from their strongholds. 46 Yahweh lives, and blessed be my rock, and may the God of my salvation be exalted— 47 the God who executed vengeance for me, and subdued peoples under me, 48 who delivered me from my enemies. Indeed, you exalted me higher than those who rose against me. You delivered me from the man of violence. 49 Therefore I will give thanks to you among the nations, O Yahweh, and I will sing the praise of your name: 50 the one who makes great victories for his king, and who shows loyal love for his anointed, to David and to his descendants forever.

Psalms,"For the music director. A psalm of David. 1 The heavens are telling the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands. 2 Every day they pour forth speech, and every night they tell knowledge. 3 There is no speech and there are no words; their sound is inaudible. 4 Yet in all the world their line goes out, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has pitched a tent for the sun, 5 and it is like a bridegroom who comes out of his bridal chamber. It is glad like a strong man to run its course. 6 Its rising is from one end of the heavens and its circuit to the other end of them; and nothing is hidden from its heat. 7 The law of Yahweh is perfect, reviving life. The testimony of Yahweh is firm, making wise the simple. 8 The precepts of Yahweh are right, making the heart rejoice. The command of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes. 9 The fear of Yahweh is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of Yahweh are true; they are righteous altogether, 10 more desirable than gold, even much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, even honey in the comb. 11 Moreover, your servant is warned by them; in keeping them is great reward. 12 Who can perceive his errors? Acquit me from hidden faults. 13 Also, keep back your servant from arrogant sins; let them not rule over me. Then I shall be blameless, and I shall be innocent of great transgression. 14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your presence, O Yahweh, my rock and my redeemer.  For the music director. A psalm of David. 1 May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble. May the name of Jacob’s God protect you. 2 May he send you help from the sanctuary, and from Zion may he sustain you. 3 May he remember all your offerings, and your burnt offering may he regard favorably. Selah 4 May he give to you your heart’s desire, and your every plan may he fulfill. 5 May we shout for joy over your victory, and in the name of our God may we set up banners. May Yahweh fulfill all your requests. 6 Now I know that Yahweh will help his anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven with the victorious power of his right hand. 7 Some boast in chariots and others in horses, but we boast in the name of Yahweh, our God. 8 They will collapse and fall, and we will rise and stand firm. 9 Rescue, O Yahweh. Let the king answer us when we call. ",Psalms 19-20,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/psalms-19-20-33607/direct-download/tbd20080814.mp3
Psalms,"For the music director. A psalm of David. 1 O Yahweh, the king will rejoice in your strength, and how greatly he will delight in your help. 2 You have given him the desire of his heart, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah 3 For you meet him with blessings of good things. You set on his head a crown of fine gold. 4 He asked life from you; you gave it to him— length of days forever and ever. 5 His honor is great because of your help. Splendor and majesty you have bestowed upon him. 6 For you set on him blessings forever. You make him glad with the joy of your presence. 7 Because the king trusts Yahweh, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved. 8 Your hand will find all your enemies; your right hand will find those who hate you. 9 You will make them like your fiery furnace at the time of your appearance. Yahweh will swallow them in his wrath and fire will consume them. 10 You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their descendants from among the children of humankind. 11 Though they have plotted evil against you, though they have planned a scheme, they will not prevail. 12 For you will turn them to flight; you will aim arrows on your bowstrings at their faces. 13 Be exalted, O Yahweh, in your strength, and we sing and praise your power.  For the music director; according to The Doe of the Dawn. A psalm of David. 1 My God, my God why have you forsaken me? Why are you far from helping me, far from the words of my groaning? 2 O my God, I call by day and you do not answer, and by night but I have no rest. 3 Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel. 4 Our ancestors trusted you; they trusted and you delivered them. 5 They cried to you and were saved; they trusted you and were not ashamed. 6 But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by humankind and despised by people. 7 All who see me mock me. They open wide their lips; they shake the head, saying: 8 “He trusts Yahweh. Let him rescue him. Let him deliver him because he delights in him.” 9 Yet you took me from the belly; you made me trust while on my mother’s breasts. 10 On you I was cast from the womb. From my mother’s belly you have been my God. 11 Do not be far from me because trouble is near; because there is no helper. 12 Many bulls have encircled me; mighty bulls of Bashan have surrounded me. 13 They open their mouth against me like a lion tearing and roaring. 14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax; it is melted within me. 15 My strength is dry like a potsherd, and my tongue is sticking to my jaws; and you have placed me in the dust of death. 16 Because dogs have surrounded me; a gang of evildoers has encircled me. Like the lion they are at my hands and my feet. 17 I can count all my bones; they gaze, they look at me. 18 They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots. 19 But you, O Yahweh, do not remain distant. O my help, hasten to help me. 20 Rescue my life from the sword, my only life from the power of the dogs. 21 Save me from the mouth of the lion, and from the horns of the wild oxen answer me. 22 I will tell your name to my brothers; inside the assembly I will praise you. 23 You who revere Yahweh, praise him! Glorify him, all you seed of Jacob, and be in awe of him, all you seed of Israel, 24 because he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, and has not hid his face from him; but he listened to him when he cried for help. 25 From you is my praise. In the great assembly, I will pay my vows before those who revere him. 26 The afflicted will eat and will be satisfied. Those who seek him will praise Yahweh. May your heart live forever. 27 All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to Yahweh. All the families of the nations will worship before you. 28 Because the kingship belongs to Yahweh, and he rules over the nations. 29 All the healthy ones of the earth will eat and worship. Before him all of those descending into the dust will kneel, even he who cannot keep his soul alive. 30 Descendants will serve him.

Psalms,"A psalm of David. 1 Yahweh is my shepherd; I will not lack for anything. 2 In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by quiet waters he leads me. 3 He restores my life. He leads me in correct paths for the sake of his name. 4 Even when I walk in a dark valley, I fear no evil because you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 5 You prepare before me a table in the presence of my oppressors. You anoint my head with oil; my cup is overflowing. 6 Surely goodness and loyal love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will stay in the house of Yahweh for a very long time.

And who may stand in his holy place? 4 He who is innocent of hands and pure of heart, who does not lift up his soul to falseness, and does not swear deceitfully. 5 He will receive blessing from Yahweh, and justice from the God of his salvation. 6 Such is the sort of those who seek him, those who seek your face, even Jacob.

Psalms,"Of David. 1 Yahweh is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? Yahweh is the refuge of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 2 When evildoers drew near against me to eat my flesh— my adversaries and my enemies who drew near to me— they themselves stumbled and fell. 3 Though an army encamp against me, my heart will not fear. Though war arise against me, even in this I will remain confident. 4 One thing I have asked from Yahweh; it I will seek: that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Yahweh, and to consider his temple. 5 Because he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble. He will conceal me in the hiding place of his tent. He will set me high upon a rock. 6 And now my head will be high over my enemies round about me. And I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh. 7 Hear, O Yahweh, my voice when I call, and be gracious to me and answer me. 8 On your behalf my heart says, “Seek my face.” Your face, O Yahweh, I do seek. 9 Do not hide your face from me; do not turn your servant away in anger. You have been my help; do not abandon nor forsake me, O God of my salvation. 10 If my father or my mother forsake me, then Yahweh will receive me. 11 Teach me, O Yahweh, your way, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies. 12 Do not give me over to the desire of my enemies, because false witnesses have arisen against me, and each breathing out violence. 13 Surely I believe that I will see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living. 14 Wait for Yahweh. Be strong and let your heart show strength, and wait for Yahweh.  A psalm of David. 1 To you, O Yahweh, I call. O my rock, do not be deaf to me. Or else, if you are silent to me, then I will become like those descending to the pit. 2 Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to you for help, when I lift up my hands toward your holy inner sanctuary. 3 Do not drag me away with the wicked or with the workers of evil, who speak of peace with their neighbors, while evil is in their heart. 4 Give to them according to their work, even according to the evil of their deeds. Give to them according to the work of their hands; repay them their rightful due. 5 Because they do not regard the works of Yahweh, nor the work of his hands, he will destroy them and not rebuild them. 6 Blessed is Yahweh, because he has heard the voice of my supplications. 7 Yahweh is my strength and my shield. My heart trusts him and I am helped. So my heart rejoices, and with my song I will give thanks to him. 8 Yahweh is their strength, and he is the refuge for the salvation of his anointed one. 9 Save your people and bless your heritage.

You preserved me alive from among those going down to the pit. 4 Sing praises to Yahweh, you his faithful ones, and give thanks to his holy fame. 5 For there is a moment in his anger; there is a lifetime in his favor.

Psalms,"Of David. A maskil. 1 Happy is he whose transgression is taken away, whose sin is covered. 2 Happy is a person to whom Yahweh does not impute iniquity and in whose spirit there is not deceit. 3 When I kept silent, my bones were worn out due to my groaning all the day. 4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me. My vigor was changed into the dry heat of summer. Selah 5 I made known my sin to you, and my iniquity I did not cover. I said, “I will confess concerning my transgressions to Yahweh,” and you took away the guilt of my sin. Selah 6 Therefore let all the faithful pray to you at the time for finding you. Surely at the flood of many waters they will not reach him. 7 You are my hiding place; from trouble you preserve me. With cries of deliverance you surround me. Selah 8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way that you should go. I will advise you with my eye upon you. 9 Do not be like a horse or like a mule, without understanding; that needs his tackle—bridle and rein—for restraint or he would not come near you. 10 Many are the pains of the wicked, but for the one who trusts Yahweh loyal love surrounds him. 11 Be glad in Yahweh and rejoice, you righteous, and shout for joy, all you upright of heart. 1 Exult in Yahweh, O you righteous, for praise is fitting for the upright. 2 Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre; with a harp of ten strings play to him. 3 Sing to him a new song; play skillfully with jubilant shout. 4 For the word of Yahweh is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness. 5 He loves righteousness and justice. The earth is full of the loyal love of Yahweh. 6 By the word of Yahweh the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host. 7 He gathered the waters of the sea like a heap. He put the deeps in storehouses. 8 Let all the earth fear Yahweh. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 9 For he himself spoke and it came to pass. He himself commanded and it stood firm. 10 Yahweh brings to nothing the plan of nations; he frustrates the intents of peoples. 11 The plan of Yahweh stands firm forever, the intents of his heart from one generation to the next. 12 Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh, the people he has chosen for his inheritance. 13 From heaven Yahweh looks; he sees all the children of humankind. 14 From his dwelling place he gazes on all the inhabitants of the earth, 15 he who fashions altogether their heart, he who understands all their works. 16 The king is not saved by the greatness of an army. The warrior is not delivered by the greatness of strength. 17 The horse is a false hope for victory, nor can it save by the greatness of its power. 18 Behold, the eye of Yahweh is on those who fear him, on those who hope for his loyal love 19 to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine. 20 Our soul waits for Yahweh; he is our help and our shield. 21 For in him our heart rejoices because in his holy name we trust. 22 Let your loyal love, O Yahweh, be upon us, even as we hope in you.

Psalms,"Of David, when he pretended to be crazy in front of Abimelech so that he drove him out, and so he departed. 1 I will bless Yahweh at all times; his praise shall be in my mouth continually. 2 My soul makes its boast in Yahweh; let the humble hear and be glad. 3 Magnify Yahweh with me, and let us exalt his name together. 4 I sought Yahweh and he answered me, and from all my terrors he delivered me. 5 They looked to him and were radiant, and their faces shall not be ashamed. 6 This poor man called and Yahweh heard, and saved him from all his troubles. 7 The angel of Yahweh encamps around those who fear him, and he rescues them. 8 Taste and see that Yahweh is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him. 9 Fear Yahweh, you his saints, for there is no lack for those who fear him. 10 The young lions are in want and suffer hunger, but those who seek Yahweh will not lack for any good thing. 11 Come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of Yahweh. 12 Who is the man who desires life, who loves many days in order to see good? 13 Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. 14 Turn from evil and do good. Seek peace and pursue it. 15 The eyes of Yahweh are toward the righteous, and his ears toward their cry for help. 16 The face of Yahweh is against evildoers, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 17 They cry out and Yahweh hears and delivers them from all of their troubles. 18 Yahweh is near to those who are heartbroken and saves those who are crushed in spirit. 19 Many are the distresses of the righteous, but Yahweh delivers him out of them all. 20 He protects all his bones; not one of them is broken. 21 Evil will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will incur guilt. 22 Yahweh redeems the life of his servants, and none who take refuge in him will incur guilt.  Of David. 1 Contend, O Yahweh, with my contenders; fight those who fight me. 2 Grasp buckler and shield and rise to my aid. 3 And draw the spear and javelin to meet those who pursue me. Say to my soul, “I am your salvation.” 4 Let those who seek my life be shamed and humiliated. Let those who plot calamity against me be repulsed and ashamed. 5 Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of Yahweh driving them. 6 Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of Yahweh pursuing them. 7 For without cause they secretly hide the pit with their net for me; without cause they dug it for my life. 8 Let unforeseen ruin come on him, and his net that he hid, let it catch him. Let him fall into it in ruin. 9 Then my soul will rejoice in Yahweh; it will rejoice in his salvation. 10 All of my bones shall say, “O Yahweh, who is like you, who delivers the poor from one stronger than he and the poor and needy from the one who robs him?” 11 Violent witnesses rise up; they ask me concerning what I do not know. 12 They repay me evil in place of good. It is bereavement to my soul. 13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth. I weakened my soul with fasting, and my prayer returned to me unanswered. 14 I behaved as though he were a friend or as a brother to me. As one lamenting a mother, I was bowed down in mourning. 15 But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered together; smiters whom I did not know gathered against me. They tore and did not cease. 16 Among the ungodly of the mockers at feasts, they gnashed at me with their teeth. 17 My Lord, how long will you watch? Restore my life from their ravages, my only life from the young lions. 18 I will give thanks to you in the great assembly; among the mighty people I will praise you. 19 Let not those who are wrongfully my enemies rejoice over me. Nor let those who hate me without cause wink the eye. 20 For they do not speak peace, but against the quiet ones of the land they plan deceitful words. 21 They also made wide their mouths against me. They said, “Aha! Aha! Our eyes have seen it.” 22 You have seen, O Yahweh. Do not be deaf. O Lord, do not be far from me. 23 Wake up and rouse yourself for my right, for my cause, O my God and my Lord. 24 Vindicate me according to your righteousness, O Yahweh my God, and do not let them rejoice over me. 25 Do not let them say in their hearts, “Aha, our desire.” Let them not say, “We have swallowed him up.” 26 Let them be shamed and abashed altogether, who rejoice at my misfortune. Let them put on shame and insult, who magnify themselves against me. 27 Let them shout for joy and be glad, who delight in my vindication; and let them say continually, “Yahweh is great, who delights in the welfare of his servant.” 28 Then my tongue will proclaim your righteousness, and your praise all day.

Psalms,"For the music director. Of the sons of Korah. A psalm. 1 Hear this, all you peoples; give ear, all you inhabitants of the world, 2 both low and high, rich and poor together. 3 My mouth will speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart will be understanding. 4 I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will propound my riddle on a lyre. 5 Why should I fear in times of calamity, when iniquity surrounds me at my heels, 6 those who trust their wealth and boast about the abundance of their riches? 7 Surely a man cannot redeem a brother. He cannot give to God his ransom 8 (since the redemption price for their life is costly and it always fails), 9 so that he may stay alive forever and not see the pit. 10 For he sees that the wise die, together with the fool and brute they perish, and leave their wealth to the next generation. 11 Within them they think their houses are forever, their dwelling places from generation to generation. They name their lands by their own names. 12 But man cannot continue in his pomp. He is like the beasts that perish. 13 This is the journey of those who have foolish confidence, and those after them who accept their sayings. Selah 14 Like sheep they are destined to Sheol; death will shepherd them. But the upright will rule over them in the morning, and their forms will be for Sheol to consume, far from his lofty abode. 15 Surely God will ransom my life from the power of Sheol, because he will receive me. Selah 16 Do not fear when a man becomes rich, when the wealth of his house increases, 17 because when he dies he will not take away any of it. His wealth will not follow down after him. 18 Though he congratulated his soul while he was living —and people will praise you when you do well for yourself— 19 it will go to the generation of his fathers. Never will they see light. 20 Humankind in its pomp, but does not understand, is like the beasts that perish.  A psalm of Asaph. 1 The Supreme God, God, Yahweh, has spoken and summoned the earth, from the rising of the sun to its setting. 2 From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth. 3 Our God comes and he is not silent. Before him fire devours, and around him it is very tempestuous. 4 He summons the heavens above and the earth that he might judge his people: 5 “Gather to me my loyal ones, those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” 6 And the heavens declare his righteousness, because God himself is judge. Selah 7 “Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you. I am God, your God. 8 It is not concerning a lack of your sacrifices that I rebuke you, and your burnt offerings are before me continually. 9 I will not take from your house a bull or from your stalls a he-goat, 10 because every animal of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. 11 I know every bird of the mountains, and every moving creature in the field is mine. 12 If I were hungry I would not tell you, because the world and its fullness are mine. 13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? 14 Offer to God a thank offering and pay your vows to the Most High. 15 And call me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will glorify me.” 16 But to the wicked God says, “What right have you to recite my statutes and mention my covenant with your mouth, 17 while you yourself hate discipline, and cast my words behind you? 18 When you see a thief, then you are pleased with him, and your association is with adulterers. 19 You give your mouth free rein for evil, and you harness your tongue to deceit. 20 You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your mother’s son. 21 These things you have done, and I have been silent; You imagined that I was just like you. I will rebuke you and present an argument before your eyes. 22 Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there will be none to deliver. 23 He who sacrifices a thank offering honors me, and he who orders his way; I will show him the salvation of God.” ",Psalms 49-50,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/psalms-49-50-33622/direct-download/tbd20080904.mp3

God, our God, will bless us. 7 God will bless us, and all the ends of the earth will fear him.  For the music director. Of David. A psalm. A song. 1 God will arise; his enemies will be scattered, and those who hate him will flee from before him. 2 As smoke is driven off, you will drive them off. As wax melts before fire, the wicked will perish before God. 3 But the righteous will be glad; they will exalt before God, and will rejoice with joy. 4 Sing to God, sing praises to his name. Lift up a song to the rider on the clouds—his name is Yah— and rejoice before him. 5 A father to orphans and a judge for widows is God in his holy habitation. 6 God settles the lonely in a home; he brings prisoners out into prosperity. But the rebellious abide in a barren land. 7 O God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the desert, Selah 8 the earth shook; the heavens also dripped rain at the presence of God who was at Sinai, at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 9 You caused abundant rain to fall, O God. When your inheritance was weary you revived it. 10 Your community dwelled in it. You provided in your goodness for the poor, O God. 11 The Lord gives the word. Great is the company of women who announce: 12 “The kings of armies flee, they flee, and she who remains at home divides the spoil. 13 Though you men lie down between the sheepfolds, you will be like the wings of a dove covered in silver and its pinions in yellow gold.” 14 When Shaddai scattered kings on it, on Zalmon it snowed. 15 A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of many peaks is the mountain of Bashan. 16 Why do you look with hostility, O many-peaked mountains? This mountain God desires for his dwelling. Yes, Yahweh will abide in it forever. 17 The chariots of God are twice ten thousand, with thousands doubled. The Lord is among them at Sinai, distinctive in victory. 18 You have ascended on high; you have led away captives. You have received gifts from among humankind, and even from the rebellious, so that Yah God may dwell there. 19 Blessed be the Lord. Daily he loads us with benefits, the God of our salvation. Selah 20 Our God is a God of deliverances, and to the Yahweh the Lord belong escapes from death. 21 But God will shatter the head of his enemies, the hairy scalp of the one who continues on in his guilt. 22 The Lord said, “I will bring them back from Bashan; I will bring them back from the depths of the sea, 23 so that your foot may shatter them bloody for the tongues of your dogs to have their share from the enemies.” 24 They have seen your processions, O God, the processions of my God, my king, distinctive in victory. 25 Singers went up front, those playing stringed instruments last, between them young women playing tambourines. 26 Bless God in the assemblies, Yahweh from the fountain of Israel. 27 There is little Benjamin ruling them, with the princes of Judah in their throng, the princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali. 28 Your God has commanded your strength. Show yourself strong, O God, by what you perform for us. 29 Because your temple is above Jerusalem, kings will bring tribute to you. 30 Rebuke the beasts in the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples, trampling the pieces of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in battles. 31 Ambassadors will come from Egypt; Cush will quickly stretch out her hands to God. 32 O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God; sing praise to the Lord, Selah 33 to the one who rides in the highest heavens of old. See, he gives forth his voice, a mighty voice. 34 Ascribe strength to God. His majesty is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds. 35 Awesome are you, O God, from your sanctuary. The God of Israel, it is he who gives strength and might to the people. Blessed be God.

Psalms,"A maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite. 1 I will sing forever of Yahweh’s acts of loyal love. From generation to generation I will make known your faithfulness with my mouth. 2 For I say, “Forever your loyal love is built up. The heavens you have established with your faithfulness in them.” 3 “I made a covenant with my chosen one; I swore an oath to David my servant: 4 ‘I will establish your descendants forever, and I will build up your throne from generation to generation.’ ” Selah 5 And so the heavens will praise your wonderful deed, O Yahweh, even your faithfulness, in the assembly of the holy ones. 6 For who in the sky is equal to Yahweh? Who is like Yahweh among the sons of God, 7 a God feared greatly in the council of the holy ones, and awesome above all surrounding him? 8 O Yahweh God of hosts, who is mighty like you, O Yah, with your faithfulness surrounding you? 9 You are ruling the surging of the sea. When its waves rise, you yourself still them. 10 You yourself crushed Rahab like one who is slain; you scattered your enemies with your strong arm. 11 The heavens are yours, the earth yours as well, the world with its fullness, because you founded them. 12 North and south, you created them; Tabor and Hermon shout joyfully over your name. 13 You have a mighty arm; Your hand is strong; your right hand reaches high. 14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne. Loyal love and faithfulness come before your face. 15 Blessed are the people who know the joyful shout; O Yahweh, they walk about in the light of your countenance. 16 In your name they rejoice all the day, and in your righteousness they rise up. 17 For you are the glory of their strength, and by your favor our horn rises up, 18 because our shield belongs to Yahweh, and our king to the Holy One of Israel. 19 Formerly you spoke in a vision to your faithful ones, and said, “I have bestowed help on a mighty man; I have exalted one chosen from the people. 20 I have found David, my servant. With my holy oil I have anointed him, 21 with whom my hand will be steadfast. Surely my arm will strengthen him. 22 The enemy will not deceive him, and no evil man will afflict him. 23 But I will crush his adversaries before him, and I will strike those who hate him. 24 And so my faithfulness and my loyal love will be with him, and in my name his horn will rise up. 25 And I will set his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers. 26 He will call out to me, ‘You are my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.’ 27 I will also make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. 28 Forever I will keep my loyal love for him, and my covenant will be reliable for him. 29 I will also establish his offspring forever, and his throne as the days of the heavens. 30 If his sons forsake my law and do not walk in my judgments, 31 if they defile my statutes and do not keep my commandments, 32 then I will punish their transgression with a rod, and their guilt with wounds. 33 But I will not break off my loyal love from him, and I will not be false against my faithfulness. 34 I will not defile my covenant, or alter what proceeded from my lips. 35 Once I have sworn by my holiness, ‘I will surely not lie to David, 36 His offspring will endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me. 37 Like the moon it will be steadfast forever, and like an enduring witness in the sky.’ ” Selah 38 But you have spurned and rejected; you are very angry with your anointed one. 39 You have repudiated the covenant with your servant; you have defiled his crown in the dirt. 40 You have broken down all his walls; you have made his fortifications a ruin. 41 All passing along the road plunder him; he has become a taunt to his neighbors. 42 You have raised the right hand of his adversaries. You have made all his enemies rejoice. 43 You have also turned back the edge of his sword and have not helped him stand his ground in the battle. 44 You have made his splendor to cease, and cast his throne to the ground. 45 You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with shame. Selah 46 How long, O Yahweh? Will you hide yourself forever? Will your wrath burn like fire forever? 47 Remember what my lifespan is. Remember for what vanity you have created all the children of humankind. 48 What man can live on and not see death? Can he deliver his life from the power of Sheol? Selah 49 Where are your former acts of loyal love, O Lord, that you swore to David by your faithfulness? 50 Remember, O Lord the taunting of your servants, how I bear in my bosom the taunts of all the many peoples, 51 by which your enemies taunt, O Yahweh, by which they taunt the steps of your anointed one. 52 Blessed be Yahweh forever. Amen and Amen.  A prayer of Moses, the man of God. 1 O Lord, you have been our help in all generations. 2 Before the mountains were born and you brought forth the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God. 3 You return man to the dust, saying, “Return, O sons of man.” 4 For a thousand years in your eyes are like yesterday when it passes, or like a watch in the night. 5 You sweep them away like a flood. They fall asleep. In the morning they are like grass that sprouts anew. 6 In the morning it blossoms and sprouts anew; by evening it withers and dries up. 7 For we are brought to an end by your anger, and we hasten off by your wrath. 8 You have put our iniquities before you, our hidden sins into the light of your countenance. 9 For all of our days dwindle away in your rage; we complete our years like a sigh. 10 As for the days of our years, within them are seventy years or if by strength eighty years, and their pride is trouble and disaster, for it passes quickly and we fly away. 11 Who knows the strength of your anger, and your rage consistent with the fear due you? 12 So teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom. 13 Return, O Yahweh. How long? And have compassion on your servants. 14 Satisfy us in the morning with your loyal love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days. 15 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen calamity. 16 Let your work be visible to your servants, and your majesty to their children. 17 And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish for us the work of our hands, yes, the work of our hands, establish it.

Psalms,"1 Praise Yahweh, all you nations; extol him, all you peoples. 2 For his loyal love is mighty on our behalf, and the faithfulness of Yahweh is forever. Praise Yah! 1 Give thanks to Yahweh for he is good, for his loyal love is forever. 2 Let Israel say, “His loyal love is forever.” 3 Let the house of Aaron say, “His loyal love is forever.” 4 Let those who fear Yahweh say, “His loyal love is forever.” 5 Out of my distress I called to Yah. Yah answered me, setting me in a broad place. 6 Yahweh is for me; I do not fear. What can mere humans do to me? 7 Yahweh is for me as my helper, and so I will look in triumph on those who hate me. 8 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh than to trust in humans. 9 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh than to trust princes. 10 All nations surrounded me. In the name of Yahweh I opposed them indeed. 11 They surrounded me; yes, they surrounded me. In the name of Yahweh I opposed them indeed. 12 They surrounded me like bees; they were extinguished like a fire of thorns. In the name of Yahweh I opposed them indeed. 13 You pushed me hard to make me fall, but Yahweh helped me. 14 Yah is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation. 15 The sound of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous; the right hand of Yahweh has done valiantly. 16 The right hand of Yahweh has exalted; the right hand of Yahweh has done valiantly. 17 I will not die but live, and tell of the works of Yah. 18 Yah has disciplined me severely, but he did not consign me to death. 19 Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter through them and give thanks to Yah. 20 This is the gate of Yahweh, through which the righteous will enter. 21 I will give thanks to you for you have answered me, and you have become my salvation. 22 The stone the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. 23 This is from Yahweh; it is wonderful in our eyes. 24 This is the day Yahweh has worked; let us rejoice and be glad in him. 25 O Yahweh, please save; O Yahweh, please grant success. 26 Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh. We bless you from the house of Yahweh. 27 Yahweh is God, and he has given us light. Bind the festal sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar. 28 You are my God, and I will give thanks to you.

Psalms,"1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat, yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 2 On the willows in her midst, we hung up our lyres. 3 For there our captors asked of us words of a song, and our tormentors asked of us jubilation, “Sing for us from a song of Zion.” 4 How could we sing the song of Yahweh in a foreign land? 5 If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget. 6 Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, if do not I exalt Jerusalem above my highest joy. 7 Remember, O Yahweh, against the sons of Edom the day of Jerusalem, the ones who said, “Lay it bare! Lay it bare to its foundation!” 8 O daughter of Babylon, about to be devastated, happy shall be he who pays back to you what you paid out to us. 9 Happy shall be he who seizes and smashes your children against the rock.  Of David. 1 I give you thanks with my whole heart; before the gods I sing your praise. 2 I bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name, because of your loyal love and faithfulness, for you have magnified your word according to all your name. 3 When I called and you answered me, you emboldened me in my soul with strength. 4 All the kings of the earth will praise you, O Yahweh, when they have heard the words of your mouth, 5 and they will sing of the ways of Yahweh, because Yahweh’s glory is great. 6 Though Yahweh is high, yet he sees the lowly, but the proud he perceives at a distance. 7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve me alive.

It is set high; I cannot prevail against it. 7 Where can I go from your Spirit, or where can I flee from your presence? 8 If I ascend to heaven, there you are, and if I make my bed in Sheol, look! There you are. 9 If I lift up the wings of the dawn, and I alight on the far side of the sea, 10 even there your hand would lead me, and your right hand would hold me fast. 11 And if I should say, “Surely darkness will cover me, and the light around me will be as night,” 12 even the darkness is not too dark for you, and the night shines as the day— the darkness and the light are alike for you. 13 Indeed you created my inward parts; you wove me in my mother’s womb. 14 I praise you, because I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works, and my soul knows it well. 15 My frame was not hidden from you, when I was created secretly, and intricately woven in the depths of the earth. 16 Your eyes saw my embryo, and in your book they all were written— days fashioned for me when there was not one of them. 17 And to me, how precious are your thoughts, O God; how vast is their sum. 18 If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand.

And do I not loathe those who rise up against you? 22 I hate them with a complete hatred; they have become my enemies. 23 Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. 24 And see if there is in me the worship of false gods, and lead me in the way everlasting.

Job,"1 Then Job answered and said, 2 “Truly I know that it is so, but how can a human being be just before God? 3 If he wants to contend with him, he cannot answer him one time in a thousand. 4 He is wise in heart and mighty in strength; who has resisted him and succeeded? 5 “He is the one who moves mountains, and they do not know how, who overturns them in his anger. 6 He is the one who shakes the earth from its place, and its pillars tremble. 7 He is the one who commands the sun, and it does not rise, and he seals up the stars. 8 He is the one who alone stretches out the heavens and who tramples on the waves of the sea. 9 He is the one who made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south. 10 He is the one who does great things beyond understanding and marvelous things beyond number. 11 “If he passes by me, I would not see him; and if he should move on, I would not recognize him. 12 If he would snatch away, who could turn him? Who could say to him, ‘What are you doing?’ 13 God will not turn back his anger; beneath him the helpers of Rahab bow. 14 How much less can I myself answer him? How can I choose my words with him, 15 whom I cannot answer, even though I am righteous? From my judge I must implore grace. 16 If I summon him, and he should answer me, I do not believe that he will listen to my voice— 17 who crushes me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause. 18 He will not allow me to catch my breath; rather, he will fill me with bitterness. 19 If it is a matter of strength, look, he is mighty. But if it is a matter of justice, who can summon me? 20 Even though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me; even though I am blameless, yet it would pronounce me guilty. 21 “I am blameless; I do not care about myself; I loathe my life. 22 It is all one; therefore I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’ 23 When the whip kills suddenly, he mocks at the despair of the innocent. 24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the face of its judge— if it is not he, then who is it? 25 “And my days are swifter than a runner; they flee away; they do not see good. 26 They go by like papyrus skiffs, like an eagle swoops down on its prey. 27 Though I say, ‘I will forget my complaint; I will change my expression, and I will rejoice,’ 28 I become afraid of all my sufferings; I know that you do not consider me innocent. 29 If I shall be declared guilty, why then should I labor in vain? 30 If I wash myself with soap, and I cleanse my hands with lye, 31 then you plunge me into the slime pit, and my clothes abhor me. 32 “For he is not a mortal like me that I can answer him, that we can come to trial together. 33 There is no arbiter between us that he might lay his hand on both of us. 34 May he remove his rod from me, and let his dread not terrify me; 35 then I would speak and not fear him, for in myself I am not fearful. 1 “My inner self loathes my life; I want to give vent to my complaint; I want to speak out of the bitterness of my inner self. 2 I will say to God, ‘You should not condemn me; let me know why you contend against me. 3 Is it good for you that you oppress, that you despise the labor of your hands, and you smile over the schemes of the wicked? 4 Do you have eyes of flesh? Or do you see as human beings see? 5 Are your days as the days of human beings, or your years as the days of man, 6 that you seek out my iniquity, and you search for my sin 7 because of your knowledge that I am not guilty, and there is no escaping from your hand? 8 Your hands fashioned me and made me altogether, then you destroyed me. 9 Please remember that you made me like clay, but you turn me into dust again? 10 Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese? 11 You clothed me with skin and flesh, and you knit me together with bones and sinews. 12 You have granted me life and loyal love, and your care has preserved my spirit. 13 “ ‘Yet you hid these things in your heart; I know that this was your purpose. 14 If I had sinned, then you would be watching me, and you would not acquit me of my guilt. 15 If I am guilty, woe to me! But if I am righteous, I dare not lift my head; I am filled with shame, and just look at my misery! 16 And if my head grows bold, you would hunt me as the lion in its prime; and you repeat your exploits against me. 17 You renew your witnesses against me, and you increase your vexation against me; relief forces are against me. 18 So why did you bring me forth from the womb? I should have passed away, and no eye should have seen me. 19 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been brought from the womb to the grave. 20 Are not my days few? Let him leave me alone; let him turn from me, and let me rejoice a little. 21 Before I go—and I will not return— to the land of darkness and deep shadow, 22 to the land of darkness, like the darkness of a deep shadow and chaos, so that it shines forth like darkness.’ ” ",Job 9-10,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/job-9-10-26838/direct-download/tbd20080610.mp3
Job,"1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said, 2 “Should an abundance of words go unanswered, or a man full of talk be vindicated? 3 Should your loose talk put people to silence? And when you mock, shall no one put you to shame? 4 For you say, ‘My teaching is pure, and I am clean in your sight.’ 5 But, O that God might speak, and that he would open his lips to you, 6 and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom, for insight has many sides. And know that God on your behalf has forgotten some of your guilt. 7 “Can you find out the essence of God, or can you find out the ultimate limits of Shaddai? 8 It is higher than the heaven; what can you do? It is deeper than Sheol; what can you know? 9 Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea. 10 “If he passes through and imprisons someone and summons the assembly, then who can hinder him? 11 For he knows those who are worthless; when he sees iniquity, he will not consider it. 12 But an empty-headed person will get understanding when a wild donkey’s colt is born as a human being. 13 “If you yourself direct your heart and stretch out your hands to him— 14 if iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and you must not let wickedness reside in your tents— 15 surely then you will lift up your face without blemish, and you will be firmly established and will not fear. 16 For you yourself will forget your misery; you will remember it as water that has flowed past. 17 “And your life will be brighter than noon; its darkness will be like the morning. 18 And you will have confidence because there is hope; and you will be well protected—you will sleep in safety. 19 And you will lie down, and no one will make you afraid; and many will entreat your favor. 20 But the eyes of the wicked will fail; and refuge will be lost to them, and their hope is to breathe their last breath.” 1 Then Job answered and said, 2 “Truly indeed you are the people, and wisdom will die with you. 3 I also have insight like you; I am not more inferior than you. And who does not know things like these? 4 I am a laughingstock to my friends: ‘He calls on God, and he answers him.’ A righteous, blameless man is a laughingstock. 5 Those at ease have contempt for the thought of disaster, but it is ready for those unstable of foot. 6 The tents of the destroyers are at peace, and there is security for those who provoke God, for those whom God brings into his hand. 7 “But ask the animals, and they will teach you, and the birds of the heaven, and they will tell you; 8 or ask the earth, and it will teach you, and the fishes of the sea will declare to you. 9 Who among all of these does not know that Yahweh’s hand has done this? 10 In whose hand is the life of all living things and the breath of every human being? 11 Does not the ear test words and the palate taste food for itself? 12 Wisdom is with the aged, and understanding is in length of days. 13 “With him are wisdom and powerful deeds, and to him belong counsel and understanding. 14 If he tears down, then it will not be rebuilt; if he shuts a man in, then he cannot be freed. 15 Look, if he withholds the water, then they dry up; and if he sends them out, then they overwhelm the land. 16 “Strength and sound wisdom are with him; the deceived and the deceiver are his. 17 He leads counselors away stripped, and he makes fools of judges. 18 He loosens the fetters of kings, and he binds a loincloth on their loins. 19 He leads priests away stripped, and he overthrows the members of ancient families. 20 He deprives the trustworthy of speech, and he takes away the discretion of elders. 21 He pours contempt on noblemen, and he loosens the girdle of the mighty. 22 “He uncovers mysteries out of darkness, and he brings deep shadow to the light. 23 He makes the nations great, then he destroys them; he expands the nations, then he guides them. 24 He strips away the insight of the heads of the earth’s people, and he makes them wander in a pathless wasteland. 25 They grope in the dark without light, and he makes them stagger like a drunkard. 1 “Look, my eye has seen everything; my ear has heard and has understood it. 2 What you know, I myself also know— I am not more inferior than you. 3 But I would speak to Shaddai, and I desire to argue with God. 4 “But you whitewash with lies; all of you are worthless healers.

Job,"3 But I would speak to Shaddai, and I desire to argue with God. 4 “But you whitewash with lies; all of you are worthless healers. 5 O that you would keep completely silent, and that it would become wisdom for you. 6 Please hear my argument, and listen attentively to the pleadings of my lips. 7 “Will you speak falsely for God? And will you speak deceitfully for him? 8 Will you show partiality for him? Or do you want to plead God’s case? 9 Will it be well, if he examines you? Or can you deceive him like deceiving a human being? 10 “Surely he will rebuke you if you show partiality in secret. 11 Will not his majesty terrify you, and his dread fall upon you? 12 Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay. 13 “Let me have silence, and I myself will speak, and let come over me whatever may. 14 Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand? 15 Look, though he kill me, I will hope in him; however, I will defend my ways before him. 16 Moreover, this is salvation to me, that the godless would not come before him. 17 “Listen carefully to my words, and let my exposition be in your ears. 18 Please look, I have prepared my case; I know that I myself will be vindicated. 19 Who is he who will contend with me? For then I would be silent, and I would pass away. 20 “Only you must not do these two things to me; then I will not hide from your face: 21 withdraw your hand from me, and let not your dread terrify me. 22 Then call, and I myself will answer; or let me speak, then reply to me. 23 “How many are my iniquities and sins? Make known to me my transgression and my sin. 24 Why do you hide your face and count me as your enemy? 25 Will you terrify a blown leaf? And will you pursue dry stubble? 26 “Indeed, you write bitter things against me, and you make me reap the iniquities of my childhood. 27 And you put my feet in the block, and you watch all my paths; you carve a mark on the soles of my feet. 28 And he himself wastes away like something rotten, like a garment that the moth has eaten. 1 “A human being born of a woman is short of days and full of troubles. 2 Like a flower he comes up, and he withers away; and he flees like a shadow, but he does not last. 3 Even on such a one you fix your eyes, and you bring me into judgment with you. 4 “Who can bring a clean thing from an unclean thing? No one! 5 If his days are determined, the number of his months is with you; you have appointed his boundaries, and he cannot cross them. 6 Look away from him, and let him desist until he enjoys his days like a laborer. 7 “Indeed, there is hope for a tree: if it is cut down, then it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not cease; 8 though its root grows old in the earth, and its stump dies in the dust, 9 at the scent of water it will bud, and it will put forth branches like a young plant. 10 “But a man dies, and he dwindles away; thus a human being passes away, and where is he? 11 As water disappears from a lake, and a river withers away and dries up, 12 so a man lies down, and he does not arise. Until the heavens are no more, they will not awaken, and they will not be roused out of their sleep. 13 “O that you would conceal me in Sheol, that you would hide me until your wrath is past, that you would appoint a set time for me and remember me. 14 If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my compulsory service I will wait, until the coming of my relief. 15 You would call, and I myself would answer you; you would long for the work of your hand. 16 For then you would count my steps, but you would not keep watch over my sin. 17 My transgression would be sealed in a bag, and you would cover over my guilt. 18 “But a mountain falls; it crumbles away, and a rock moves away from its place. 19 Water wears away stones; its torrents wash away the soil of the earth; so you destroy the hope of human beings. 20 You overpower him forever, and he passes away; you change his countenance, then you send him away. 21 His children may come to honor, but he does not know it; or they may become lowly, but he does not realize it. 22 He feels only the pain of his own body, and his inner self mourns for him.” 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 2 “Should the wise answer with windy knowledge, and should he fill his stomach with the east wind? 3 Should he argue in talk that is not profitable or in words with which he cannot do good? 4 “What is worse, you yourself are doing away with fear, and you are lessening meditation before God. 5 For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty. 6 Your mouth condemns you, and not I; and your lips testify against you. 7 “Were you born the firstborn of the human race? And were you brought forth before the hills? 8 Have you listened in God’s confidential discussion? And do you limit wisdom to yourself? 9 What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not clear to us? 10 Both the gray-haired and the old are among us— those older than your father. 11 “Are the consolations of God too small for you, a word spoken gently with you? 12 Why does your heart carry you away? And why do your eyes flash, 13 that you turn your spirit against God, and you let such words go out of your mouth? 14 “What is a human being, that he can be clean, or that one born of a woman can be righteous? 15 Look, he does not trust his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his eyes. 16 How much less he who is abominable and corrupt, a man drinking wickedness like water. 17 “I will show you, listen to me; and what I have seen, I will tell— 18 what wise men have told, and they have not hidden that which is from their ancestors, 19 to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed through their midst. 20 “All of the wicked one’s days he is writhing, even through the number of years that are laid up for the tyrant. 21 Sounds of terror are in his ears; in prosperity the destroyer will come against him. 22 He cannot trust that he will return from darkness, and he himself is destined for the sword. 23 “He is wandering for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’ He knows that a day of darkness is ready at hand. 24 Anguish and distress terrify him; they overpower him like a king ready for the battle. 25 Because he stretched out his hand against God, and he was arrogant to Shaddai; 26 he stubbornly runs against him with his thick-bossed shield. 27 “Because he has covered his face with his fat and has gathered fat upon his loins, 28 he will dwell in desolate cities, in houses that they should not inhabit, which are destined for rubble. 29 He will not become rich, and his wealth will not endure, and their possessions will not stretch across the earth. 30 “He will not escape from darkness; a flame will dry up his new shoot, and by the wind of his mouth he shall be removed. 31 Let him not trust in emptiness—he will be deceiving himself— for worthlessness will be his recompense. 32 It will be paid in full before his time, and his branch will not flourish. 33 “He will shake off his unripe fruit like the vine, and he will cast off his blossom like the olive tree; 34 for the company of the godless is barren, and fire consumes the tents of those who accept bribes. 35 They conceive trouble and bring forth mischief, and their womb prepares deceit.” ",Job 13:3-15:35,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/job-133-1535-26840/direct-download/tbd20080612.mp3
Job,"1 Then Job answered and said, 2 “I have heard many things like these; all of you are miserable comforters. 3 Is there a limit to windy words? What provokes you that you answer? 4 I myself also could talk as you, if you were in my place; I could join against you with words, and I could shake at you with my head. 5 I could encourage you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would ease the pain. 6 If I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I cease, how much will leave me? 7 “Surely now he has worn me out; you have devastated all my company. 8 Thus you shriveled me up; it became a witness. And my leanness has risen up against me; it testifies to my face. 9 His wrath has torn, and he has been hostile toward me; he gnashed at me with his teeth. My foe sharpens his eyes against me. 10 They gaped at me with their mouth; they struck my cheeks with disgrace; they have massed themselves together against me. 11 God delivers me to an evil one, and he casts me into the hands of the wicked. 12 “I was at ease, then he broke me in two, and he seized me by my neck; then he shattered me and set me up as a target for him. 13 His archers surround me; he slashes open my kidneys, and he does not have compassion; he pours out my gall on the ground. 14 He breached me breach upon breach; he rushes at me like a warrior. 15 “I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and I have inserted my pride in the dust. 16 My face is red because of weeping, and deep shadows are on my eyelids, 17 although violence is not on my hands, and my prayer is pure. 18 “O earth, you should not cover my blood, and let there be no place for my cry for help. 19 So now look, my witness is in the heavens, and he who vouches for me is in the heights. 20 My friends scorn me; my eye pours out tears to God, 21 and it argues for a mortal with God, and as a human for his friend. 22 Indeed, after a few years have come, then I will go the way from which I will not return. 1 “My spirit is pulled down; my days are extinguished; the graveyard is for me. 2 Surely mockery is with me, and my eye rests on their provocation. 3 Please lay down a pledge for me with yourself; who is he who will give security for my hand? 4 Indeed, you have closed their mind from understanding; therefore, you will not let them triumph. 5 He denounces friends for reward, so his children’s eyes will fail. 6 “And he has made me a proverb for the peoples, and I am one before whom people spit. 7 And my eye has grown dim from grief, and the limbs of my body are all like a shadow. 8 The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent excites himself over the godless. 9 But the righteous holds on to his way, and he who has clean hands increases in strength. 10 But all of you must return—please come! But I shall not find a wise person among you. 11 “My days are past; my plans are broken down— even the desires of my heart. 12 They make night into day, saying, ‘Light is near to darkness.’ 13 If I hope for Sheol as my house, if I spread my couch in the darkness, 14 if I call to the pit, ‘You are my father,’ to the maggot, ‘You are my mother or my sister,’ 15 where then is my hope? And who will see my hope? 16 Will they go down to the bars of Sheol? Or shall we descend together into the dust?” 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said, 2 “How long will you hunt for words?

Job,"2 “How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and afterward we shall speak. 3 Why are we considered as animals? Why are we taken as stupid in your eyes? 4 “You who are tearing yourself in your anger, will the earth be forsaken because of you? Or will the rock be removed from its place? 5 Furthermore, the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of his fire will not shine. 6 The light becomes dark in his tent, and his lamp above him is put out. 7 “His strong steps are shortened, and his own schemes throw him down, 8 for he is thrust into a net by his feet, and he walks into a pitfall. 9 A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare takes hold of him. 10 His rope is hidden in the ground, and his trap on the path. 11 “Sudden terrors terrify him all around, and they chase him at his heels. 12 His wealth will become hunger, and disaster is ready for his stumbling. 13 It consumes parts of his skin; the firstborn of death consumes his limbs. 14 He is torn from his tent in which he trusted, and it brought him to the king of terrors. 15 “Nothing remains for him in his tent; sulfur is scattered upon his dwelling place. 16 His roots dry up below, and its branches wither away above. 17 His remembrance perishes from the earth, and there is not a name for him on the street. 18 “They thrust him from light into darkness, and they drive him out from the world. 19 There is no offspring for him nor a descendant among his people, and there is not a survivor in his abode. 20 Those of the west are appalled over his fate, and those of the east are seized with horror. 21 Surely these are the dwellings of the godless, and this is the dwelling place of him who knows not God.” 1 Then Job answered and said, 2 “How long will you torment me and crush me with words? 3 These ten times you have disgraced me; you are not ashamed that you have attacked me. 4 And what is more, if I have truly erred, my error remains with me. 5 If indeed you must magnify yourselves against me, and you must let my disgrace argue against me, 6 know then that God has wronged me and has surrounded me with his net. 7 “Look, I cry out, ‘Violence!’ but I am not answered; I cry out, but there is no justice. 8 He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass; and he has set darkness upon my paths. 9 He has taken my glory from me, and he has removed the crown of my head. 10 He has broken me down all around, and I am gone. And he has uprooted my hope like a tree, 11 and he has kindled his wrath against me, and he has counted me as one of his foes. 12 His troops have come together and have thrown up their rampart against me and have encamped around my tent. 13 “He has removed my kinsfolk from me, and my acquaintances have only turned aside from me. 14 My relatives have failed, and my close friends have forgotten me. 15 The sojourners in my house and my slave women count me as a stranger; I have become a foreigner in their eyes. 16 I call to my servant, but he does not answer; I must personally plead with him. 17 My breath is repulsive to my wife, and I am loathsome to my own family. 18 Little boys also despise me; when I rise, then they talk against me. 19 All my intimate friends abhor me, and these whom I have loved have turned against me. 20 My bones cling to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. 21 “Pity me, pity me, you my friends, for God’s hand has touched me. 22 Why do you pursue me like God? And are not satisfied with my flesh? 23 “O that my words could be written down! O that they could be inscribed in a scroll! 24 That with a pen of iron and with lead they might be engraved on a rock forever! 25 But I myself know that my redeemer is alive, and at the last he will stand up upon the earth. 26 And after my skin has been thus destroyed, but from my flesh I will see God, 27 whom I will see for myself, and whom my eyes will see and not a stranger. My heart faints within me. 28 “If you say, ‘How will we persecute him?’ And ‘The root of the trouble is found’ in me, 29 be afraid for yourselves because of the sword, for wrath brings punishment by the sword, so that you may know that there is judgment.” 1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said, 2 “Therefore my disquieting thoughts bring me back for the sake of my inward excitement. 3 I hear discipline that insults me, and a spirit beyond my understanding answers me.

Job,"1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said, 2 “Therefore my disquieting thoughts bring me back for the sake of my inward excitement. 3 I hear discipline that insults me, and a spirit beyond my understanding answers me. 4 “Did you know this from of old, since the setting of the human being on earth, 5 that the rejoicing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless lasts only a moment? 6 Even though his stature mounts up to the heaven, and his head reaches to the clouds, 7 he will perish forever like his dung; those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’ 8 He will fly away like a dream, and they will not find him, and he will be chased away like a vision of the night. 9 The eye that saw him will not see him again, and his place will no longer behold him. 10 His children will seek favors from the poor, and his hands will return his wealth. 11 His bones were full of his vigor, but it will lie down with him on the dust. 12 “Though wickedness tastes sweet in his mouth, and he hides it under his tongue, 13 though he spares it and does not let it go and holds it back in the midst of his palate, 14 in his bowels his food is turned, the venom of horned vipers is within him. 15 He swallows riches, but he vomits them up; God drives them out from his stomach. 16 He will suck the poison of horned vipers; the viper’s tongue will kill him. 17 He will not enjoy the streams, the torrents of honey and curds. 18 Returning the products of his toil, he will not swallow; according to the profit of his trade, he will not enjoy, 19 for he has oppressed; he has abandoned the poor; he has seized a house but did not build it. 20 Because he has not known satisfaction in his stomach, he lets nothing escape that he desires. 21 There is nothing left after he has eaten; therefore his prosperity will not endure. 22 In the fullness of his excess he will be in distress; all of misery’s power will come upon him. 23 When his stomach fills up, God will send his burning anger upon him, and he will let it rain down upon him as his food. 24 “He will flee from an iron weapon, but an arrow of bronze will pierce him. 25 He draws it forth, and it comes out from his body, and the glittering point comes from his gall-bladder; terrors come upon him. 26 Total darkness is hidden for his treasures; an unfanned fire will devour him; the remnant will be consumed in his tent. 27 The heavens will reveal his guilt, and the earth will rise up against him. 28 The products of his house will be carried away like gushing waters on the day of his wrath. 29 This is a wicked human being’s portion from God and the inheritance of his decree from God.” 1 Then Job answered and said, 2 “Listen carefully to my words, and let this be your consolation. 3 Bear with me, and I myself will speak; then after my speaking you can mock. 4 As for me, is my complaint for human beings? And if so, why cannot I be impatient? 5 Turn to me and be appalled, and place your hand on your mouth. 6 And when I think of it, I am horrified, and shuddering seizes my flesh. 7 “Why do the wicked live, grow old, even grow mighty in power? 8 With them their offspring are established before them, and their descendants before their eyes. 9 Their houses are safe without fear, and the rod of God is not upon them. 10 His bull breeds and does not fail; his cow calves and does not miscarry. 11 They send out their little ones like the flock, and their children dance around. 12 They sing to the tambourine and lyre, and they rejoice to the sound of the long flute. 13 They spend their days in prosperity, and in peace they go down to Sheol. 14 And they say to God, ‘Turn away from us, for we do not desire to know your ways. 15 Who is Shaddai that we should serve him, or what would we benefit when we plead with him?’ 16 Look, their prosperity is not in their hands; the schemes of the wicked are repugnant to me. 17 “How often is the lamp of the wicked put out, and their disaster comes upon them? He distributes pains in his anger. 18 How often are they like straw before the wind, and like chaff that the storm carries away? 19 ‘God stores up his iniquity for his children’? Then let him repay it to him that he may know. 20 Let his eyes see his decay, and let him drink from the wrath of Shaddai, 21 for what does he care for his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off? 22 Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since he himself judges high ones? 23 This one dies in full prosperity, completely at ease and secure. 24 His vats are full with milk and the marrow of his bones is moist. 25 Yet another dies with a bitter inner self and has not tasted prosperity. 26 They lie down together in the dust, and maggots cover them. 27 “Look, I know your thoughts and the schemes you devise against me. 28 For you say, ‘Where is the nobleman’s house, and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell?’ 29 Do you not ask those traveling the roads, and do you not take notice of their accounts? 30 Indeed, the wicked is spared from the day of disaster; he is delivered from the day of wrath. 31 Who denounces his way to his face? And who repays him for what he has done? 32 When he is brought to the grave, then someone stands guard over the tomb. 33 The clods of the valley are sweet to him; everyone will follow after him, and before him they are innumerable. 34 So how will you comfort me with emptiness, when fraud is left in your answers?” 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 2 “Can a man be of use to God? Yes, can the wise be of use to him? ",Job 20:1-22:2,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/job-201-222-26843/direct-download/tbd20080617.mp3
Job,"1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 2 “Can a man be of use to God? Yes, can the wise be of use to him? 3 Is it a pleasure to Shaddai if you are righteous, or a gain if you make your ways blameless? 4 Does he reprove you because of your reverence or enter into judgment with you? 5 Is not your wickedness great, and there is no end to your iniquities? 6 “Indeed, you have required a pledge from your family for nothing, and you have stripped off the clothes of the naked. 7 You have given no water for the weary to drink, and you withheld food from the hungry. 8 And the land belongs to the man of power, and the favored lives in it. 9 You have sent widows away empty-handed, and the arms of orphans were crushed. 10 Therefore trapping nets are all around you, and panic suddenly terrifies you, 11 or it is so dark you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you. 12 “Is not God in the height of the heavens? But see how lofty are the highest stars. 13 And you ask, ‘What does God know? Can he judge through deep gloom? 14 Thick clouds are a covering for him, so that he does not see; and he walks about on the dome of heaven.’ 15 Will you keep to the way of old that the people of mischief have trod, 16 who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was washed away by a current? 17 Those who said to God, ‘Turn away from us,’ and ‘What can Shaddai do to us?’ 18 Yet he himself filled up their houses with good things, but the schemes of the wicked are repugnant to me. 19 The righteous see, and they rejoice, but the innocent one mocks at them. 20 Surely our foe perishes, and fire has consumed their remainder. 21 “Please reconcile yourself with him, and be at peace; in this way, good will come to you. 22 Please receive instruction from his mouth, and place his words in your heart. 23 If you return to Shaddai, you will be restored; if you remove wickedness from your tent, 24 and if you put gold ore in the dust, and the gold of Ophir in the rock of wadis, 25 then Shaddai will be your gold ore and your precious silver. 26 Indeed, then you will delight yourself in Shaddai, and you will expect that God will be good to you. 27 You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows. 28 And you will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways. 29 When they are humiliated, you say, ‘It is pride,’ for he saves the humble. 30 He will deliver the guilty, and he will escape because of the cleanness of your hands.” 1 Then Job answered and said, 2 “Even today my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy in addition to my groaning. 3 O that I knew and that I might find him; O that I might come to his dwelling. 4 I would lay my case before him, and I would fill my mouth with arguments. 5 I want to know the words with which he would answer me, and I want to understand what he would say to me. 6 Would he contend with me in the greatness of his strength? No, but he himself would give heed to me. 7 There an upright person could reason with him, and I would be acquitted forever by my judge. 8 “When I go forward, he is not there, or backward, I cannot see him. 9 When he works on the left, I cannot perceive him; he turns to the right, but I cannot see him. 10 But he knows the way that I take; he tests me—I shall come out like gold. 11 My foot has held on to his steps; I have kept his way, and I have not turned aside. 12 From the commandment of his lips, indeed I have not departed; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily food. 13 “But he is alone, and who can dissuade him? And whatever he desires, indeed, he does it. 14 For he will carry out what he appoints for me, and many things like these are with him. 15 Therefore, I am horrified because of his presence; when I consider, I tremble because of him. 16 Indeed, God has made my heart faint, and Shaddai has terrified me. 17 Indeed, I have not been silenced because of darkness, and because of me he conceals thick darkness.

Job,"1 “Why are not times kept by Shaddai, and why do not those who know him see his days? 2 They remove border stones; they seize flocks, and they pasture them. 3 They drive away the donkey of orphans; they take the widow’s ox as a pledge. 4 They thrust the poor off the road; the needy of the earth hide themselves together. 5 “Look, like wild donkeys in the desert they go out to their labor as searchers for the prey; the wilderness is their food for the young. 6 They reap their fodder in the field, and they glean in the vineyard of the wicked. 7 They spend the night naked, without clothing, and they have no garment in the cold. 8 They are wet from the rainstorm of the mountains, and they cling to the rock without refuge. 9 “They snatch the orphan from the breast, and they take a pledge against the needy. 10 They go about naked, without clothing, and hungry, they carry the sheaves. 11 Between their terraces they press out oil; they tread the presses, but they are thirsty. 12 From the city people groan, and the throat of the wounded cries for help; yet God does not regard it as unseemly. 13 “Those are among the ones rebelling against the light; they do not recognize his ways, and they do not stay in his paths. 14 At dusk the murderer rises; he kills the needy and the poor, and in the night he is like a thief. 15 And the eye of the adulterer waits for dusk, saying, ‘No eye will see me,’ and he places a covering on his face. 16 He digs through houses in the darkness; by day they shut themselves in— they do not know the light 17 because morning likewise is to them deep darkness; indeed, they know about the terrors of deep darkness. 18 “He himself is swift on the water’s surface; their portion is cursed in the land. No one turns toward the path of their vineyards. 19 Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters, like Sheol snatches away those who have sinned. 20 The womb forgets him. The maggot feasts on him until he is no longer remembered, and wickedness is broken like a tree. 21 He feeds on the barren, who does not have a child, and does no good to the widow. 22 Yet he carries off the tyrants by his strength; if he rises up, then he cannot be certain of life. 23 He gives security to him, and he is supported, but his eyes are upon their ways. 24 They are exalted a little while, then they are gone. And they are brought low; they are cut off like all others, and like the heads of grain they wither away. 25 “And if it is not so, then who can prove me a liar and reduce my word to nothing?” 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said, 2 “Domination and dread are with him who makes peace in his high heavens. 3 Is there a number to his troops?

And how will he who is born of a woman be pure? 5 Look, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure in his sight. 6 How much less for a human being who is a maggot, and a human who is a worm?” 1 Then Job answered and said, 2 “How you have helped one who has no power! How you have assisted the arm that has no strength! 3 How you have advised one who has no wisdom! And what sound wisdom you have made known in abundance! 4 With whose help have you uttered words, and whose breath has come forth from you? 5 “The spirits of the dead tremble below the waters and their inhabitants. 6 Sheol is naked before him, and there is no covering for Abaddon. 7 He stretches out the north over emptiness; he hangs the earth over nothing.

Job,"7 He stretches out the north over emptiness; he hangs the earth over nothing. 8 He ties up the water in its clouds, and the cloud is not torn open beneath it. 9 He covers the face of the full moon; he spreads his cloud over it. 10 He has described a circle on the face of the water between light and darkness. 11 “The pillars of heaven tremble, and they are astounded at his rebuke. 12 By his power he stilled the sea, and by his understanding he struck down Rahab. 13 By his breath the heavens were made clear; his hand pierced the fleeing snake. 14 Look, these are the outer fringes of his ways, and how faint is the word that we hear of him! But who can understand the thunder of his power?” 1 Then Job again took up his discourse and said, 2 “As God lives, he has removed my justice, and Shaddai has made my inner self bitter. 3 For as long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nose, 4 my lips surely will not speak falseness, and my tongue surely will not utter deceit. 5 Far be it from me that I would say that you are right; until I pass away, I will not put away from me my blamelessness. 6 I hold fast to my righteousness, and I will not let it go; my heart will not blame any of my days. 7 “Let my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unrighteous, 8 for what is the hope of the godless when he cuts them off, when God takes away his life? 9 Will God hear his cry of distress when distress comes upon him? 10 Or, in Shaddai will he find delight? Will he call upon God at all times? 11 “I will teach you about God’s hand; I will not conceal that which is with Shaddai. 12 Look, you all have seen, and why in the world have you become altogether vain? 13 “This is the portion of the wicked human being with God, and they receive from Shaddai the inheritance of the ruthless. 14 If their children multiply, it is for the sword, and his offspring do not have enough to eat. 15 Their survivors are buried through the plague, and their widows do not weep. 16 If he heaps up silver like the dust and fashions clothing like the clay, 17 he makes it ready, and the righteous will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver. 18 “He builds his house like the moth, and like a booth that a watchman has made. 19 He goes to bed with wealth, but he will do so no more; he opens his eyes, and it is gone. 20 Terrors overtake him like the water; a storm wind carries him off in the night. 21 The east wind lifts him up, and he is gone, and it sweeps him away from his place. 22 And it hurls at him, and it has no compassion; he will quickly flee from its power. 23 It claps its hands over him, and it hisses at him from its place. 1 “Indeed, there is a mine for silver and a place for gold to be refined. 2 Iron is taken from dust, and he pours out copper from ore. 3 He puts an end to darkness, and he searches out the farthest limits for the ore in gloom and deep shadow. 4 He breaks open a mine shaft away from where people dwell; those who are forgotten by travelers, they dangle, they sway far away from human beings. 5 As for the earth, from it comes food, but underneath it, it is turned up as by fire. 6 Its stones are the place of sapphire, and the earthen dirt has gold. 7 “It is a path a bird of prey does not know and the black kite’s eye has not seen. 8 Proud wild animals have not trodden it; the lion in its prime has not prowled over it. 9 He puts his hand on the hard rock; he overturns mountains by the roots. 10 He cuts out tunnels in the rocks, and his eye sees every treasure. 11 He dams up rivers from their sources, and he brings secret things to the light. 12 “But from where will wisdom be found? And where in the world is the place of understanding? 13 A human being does not know its proper value, and it is not found in the land of the living. 14 The deep says, ‘It is not in me,’ and the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’ 15 “Refined gold cannot be gotten in its place, and silver cannot be weighed out as its price. 16 It cannot be bought for the gold of Ophir, for precious onyx or sapphire. 17 Gold and glass cannot be compared with it, and its substitution cannot be an ornament of refined gold. 18 Black corals and crystal will not be mentioned, and wisdom’s price is more than red corals. 19 The topaz of Cush cannot be compared with it; it cannot be bought for pure gold. 20 Indeed, from where does wisdom come? And where in the world is the place of understanding? 21 It is hidden from the eyes of all living, and it is concealed from the birds of the heaven. 22 Abaddon and Death say, ‘We heard its rumor with our ears.’ 23 “God understands its way, and he knows its place, 24 for he himself looks to the end of the earth; he sees under all the heaven. 25 When he gave weight to the wind and he apportioned the waters by measure, 26 when he made a rule for the rain and a way for the thunder’s lightning bolt, 27 then he saw it and talked about it; he established it, and moreover, he explored it. 28 And to the human beings he said, ‘Look, the fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding.’ ” ",Job 26:7-28:28,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/job-267-2828-26846/direct-download/tbd20080620.mp3
Job,"1 Then Job again took up his discourse and said, 2 “O that I were as in the months before, as in the days when God watched over me, 3 when his shining lamp was over my head— by his light I walked through darkness— 4 as when I was in the days of my prime, when God’s confiding was over my house, 5 when Shaddaiwas still with me, my children were all around me, 6 when my paths were washed in sour milk, and the rock poured out streams of oil for me. 7 “At my going out the gate to the city, I secured my seat in the square. 8 Young men saw me and stepped aside, and the aged rose up and stood. 9 Officials refrained from talking, and they laid their hand on their mouth. 10 The voices of nobles were hushed, and their tongue stuck to their palate. 11 “When the ear heard and commended me, and the eye saw and testified in support of me 12 because I saved the needy who cried for help, and I saved the orphan for whom there was no helper. 13 The blessing of the wretched came upon me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy. 14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a headband. 15 “I was eyes to the blind, and I was feet to the lame. 16 I was a father to the poor, and I investigated the stranger’s legal dispute. 17 And I broke the evil one’s jaw bones, and I made his prey drop from his teeth. 18 “And I thought, ‘I will pass away in my nest, and like the phoenix I shall multiply my days. 19 My roots were open to water, and dew spent the night on my branches; 20 My glory was new with me, and I was revitalized regularly.’ 21 “They listened to me and waited, and they kept silent for my counsel. 22 After my word, they did not speak again, and my word dropped down like dew upon them. 23 And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain. 24 I smiled for them when they had no confidence in anything, and they did not extinguish the light of my face. 25 I chose their way, and I sat as head, and I dwelled like a king among the troops, like one who comforts mourners. 1 “But now those younger than I, as far as days, laugh at me, whose fathers I rejected for setting with the dogs of my sheep and goats. 2 Moreover, what use to me is the strength of their hands? With them, vigor is destroyed. 3 Through want and through barren hunger they are gnawing in the dry region in the darkness of desolation and waste. 4 They are picking salt herbs, the leaves of bushes, and the roots of broom trees to warm themselves. 5 They were driven out from fellow people; they shout at them as at a thief, 6 so that they dwell in holes of the ground and in the rocks. 7 They bray among the bushes; they are gathered under the nettles. 8 A senseless crowd, yes, a disreputable brood, they were cast out from the land. 9 “But now I am their mocking song, and I have become a byword for them. 10 They abhor me; they keep aloof from me, and they do not withhold spit from my face 11 because he has loosened his bowstring and humbled me, and they have thrown off restraint in my presence. 12 On the right hand the brood rises up; they put me to flight, and they build up their siege ramps against me. 13 They destroy my path; they promote my destruction; they have no helper. 14 As through a wide breach they come; amid a crash they rush on. 15 Terrors are turned upon me; my honor is pursued as by the wind, and my hope of deliverance passed by like a cloud. 16 “And now my life is poured out onto me; days of misery have taken hold of me. 17 At night I am in great pain; my pains do not take a rest. 18 He seizes my clothing with great power; he grasps me by my tunic’s collar. 19 He has cast me into the dirt, and I have become like dust and ashes. 20 I cry to you for help, but you do not answer me; I stand, and you merely look at me. 21 You have turned cruel to me; you persecute me with your hand’s might. 22 You lift me up to the wind—you make me ride it, and you toss me about in the storm. 23 Indeed, I know that you will bring me to death and to the house of assembly for all the living. 24 “Surely someone must not send a hand against the needy when, in his misfortune, there is a cry of help for them. 25 Have I not wept for the unfortunate, and grieved myself over the poor? 26 Indeed, I hoped for good, but evil came, and I waited for light, but darkness came. 27 My bowels are in turmoil, and they are not still; days of misery come to confront me. 28 I go about in mourning garb, but not in sunlight; I stand up in the assembly, and I cry for help. 29 I am a companion for the jackals and a companion for ostriches. 30 My skin turns black on me, and my bones burn with heat. 31 So my lyre came to be used for mourning, and my flute for the voice of those who weep.

Job,"1 “I made a covenant with my eyes, so how could I look closely upon a virgin? 2 And what is the portion of God from above or the heritage of Shaddai from on high? 3 Is not disaster for the evil one and ruin for the workers of mischief? 4 Does he not see my ways and count all my steps? 5 “If I have walked with falseness, and my foot has hastened to deceit, 6 let him weigh me in the balance of justice, and let God know my blamelessness. 7 If my steps have turned aside from the way, and my heart has walked after my eyes, and my hand has clung to a spot, 8 let me sow, and let another eat, and let my crops be rooted out. 9 “If my heart has been enticed by a woman, and at my neighbor’s doorway I have lain in wait, 10 let my wife grind for another, and let other men kneel over her, 11 for that is a shameful act, and that is a criminal offense. 12 Indeed, that is a fire that will consume up to Abaddon, and it would uproot all my crop. 13 “If I have rejected my male or female slave’s case when their complaint was against me, 14 then what shall I do when God rises up? And when he enquires, how shall I answer him? 15 Did not he who made me in the womb make them? And did not one fashion us in the womb? 16 “If I have withheld the desire of the poor from them, or I have caused the widow’s eyes to fail, 17 or I have eaten my morsel alone, and the orphan has not eaten from it 18 (for from my childhood he grew up with me like a father, and from my mother’s womb I guided her), 19 if I have seen the one who perishes because of no clothing or that there is no covering for the poor, 20 if his loins have not blessed me, or by means of my sheep’s fleece he has warmed himself, 21 if I have raised my hand against an orphan because I saw my supporters at the gate, 22 then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, and let my arm be broken from its socket. 23 Indeed, the disaster from God was a dread for me, and I was powerless because of his majesty. 24 “If I have made gold my trust, or I have called fine gold my security, 25 if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great or because my hand found a fortune, 26 if I looked at the sun when it shone or at the moon moving in splendor, 27 and I was secretly enticed, and my hand threw them a kiss, 28 this also is an iniquity to be judged, for I have deceived God above. 29 “If I have rejoiced at the ruin of the one who hated me or have exulted when evil overtook him— 30 no, I have not allowed my mouth to sin, to ask his life with a curse. 31 Have the people of my tent not said, ‘O that someone had not been satisfied with his meat’? 32 An alien has not lodged in the street; I have opened my door to the traveler. 33 Have I concealed my transgressions as other human beings to hide my iniquity in my bosom 34 because I dreaded the great multitude, and the contempt of clans terrified me, so that I kept quiet, I did not go out of the doorway? 35 O that I had someone hearing me! Here is my signature; let Shaddai answer me! As for the written communication that my adversary has written, 36 I would surely carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it on me like a crown. 37 I would give him an account of my steps; I would approach him like a noble. 38 If my land has cried out against me, and its furrows have wept together, 39 if I have eaten its yield without payment, or I have caused the breath of its owners to die, 40 let thorns grow in place of wheat and noxious weeds in place of barley.” The words of Job are ended. 1 Then these three men ceased from answering Job because he was righteous in his own eyes. 2 So Elihu the son of Barakel the Buzite, from the clan of Ram, became angry. He became angry at Job because he justified himself rather than God, 3 and he became angry at his three friends because they had not found an answer, and they had declared Job guilty. ",Job 31:1-32:3,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/job-311-323-26848/direct-download/tbd20080624.mp3
Job,"1 Thus Elihu spoke up and said, 2 “Hear my words, you wise men, and listen to me, you who know, 3 for the ear tests words, and the palate tastes food. 4 Let us choose justice for ourselves; let us determine among ourselves what is good— 5 for Job has said, ‘I am righteous, but God has taken away my justice. 6 Should I lie concerning my justice? Though I am without transgression, my wound caused by an arrow is incurable.’ 7 What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water? 8 And he goes on the road in company with instigators of mischief, and walks with men of wickedness. 9 Indeed, he says, ‘A man does not profit when he takes delight in God.’ 10 “Therefore, listen to me, people who have sense: far be it from God that he should commit wickedness and that Shaddai should do wrong. 11 Indeed, he will repay according to a human being’s deeds, and according to a man’s way he will let it happen to him. 12 What’s more, God truly does not act wickedly, and Shaddai does not pervert justice. 13 Who gave him charge over the earth? Or who laid on him the whole world? 14 If he should set his heart to it, and he should gather his spirit and his breath to himself, 15 all flesh would perish together, and humankind would return to dust. 16 “But if you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say. 17 Shall he who hates justice really govern? Or will you declare the Righteous One, the Mighty, guilty?— 18 the one who says to a king, ‘You worthless man,’ to noblemen, ‘You wicked man,’ 19 who shows no partiality to officials and who does not take note of the noble more than of the insignificant, for all of them are the work of his hands? 20 In a moment they die, and in the middle of the night the people are shaken, and they pass away, and they take away the mighty effortlessly. 21 “Indeed, his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he sees all his steps. 22 There is no darkness, and there is no deep shadow where instigators of mischief might hide themselves. 23 Indeed, he has not yet appointed a time for man to go to God in the judgment. 24 He shatters the mighty without investigation, and he sets others in their place. 25 Therefore he knows their works, and he overturns them in the night so that they are crushed. 26 He strikes them where the wicked stood, where there are onlookers, 27 because they have turned aside from him and have not understood any of his ways, 28 so that they cause the cry of distress from the helpless to come to him, and he hears the cry of distress from the needy, 29 but he remains quiet, and who can condemn? And he hides his face, and who can behold him? Yet he is over a nation and over a person alike, 30 so that godless human beings should not reign, nor those who ensnare the people. 31 “Indeed, does anyone say to God, ‘I have endured chastisement; I will not act corruptly again; 32 teach me yourself what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not repeat it’? 33 According to your judgment, must he repay it because you rejected this? Indeed, you must choose, and not I, so declare what you know. 34 Those who have sense say to me, and the wise man hearing me says: 35 ‘Job speaks without knowledge, and his words are without insight. 36 Would that Job were tested up to the end because his answers are like those from men of mischief, 37 for he adds transgression to his sin; he claps hands among us, and he multiplies his words against God.’ ” 1 Moreover, Elihu spoke up and said, 2 “Do you think this is justice when you say, ‘I am right before God’? 3 If you ask what it profits you: ‘How do I benefit by refraining from my sin?’ 4 I myself will give answer to you and to your friends with you. 5 “Look at the heavens, and see; and observe the clouds that are higher than you. 6 If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him? 7 If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand? 8 Your wickedness affects a person like yourself, and your righteousness affects humans. 9 “Because of the multitude of oppressions, they cry out; they cry for help because of the arm of the mighty. 10 But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night, 11 who teaches us more than the animals of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’ 12 There they cry out, but he does not answer because of the pride of evildoers. 13 “Surely God does not hear an empty plea, and Shaddai does not regard it. 14 How much less when you say that you do not see him, that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him! 15 But now, because his anger does not punish, and he does not acknowledge the transgression at all, 16 therefore Job opens his mouth in empty talk— without knowledge he multiplies words.” ",Job 34-35,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/job-34-35-26851/direct-download/tbd20080627.mp3
Job,"1 Then Elihu continued and said, 2 “Bear with me a little longer, and I will explain, for I still have something to say on God’s behalf. 3 I will bring my knowledge from far away, and I will ascribe righteousness to my maker, 4 for truly my words are not falsehood; one who has perfect knowledge is with you. 5 Look, God is mighty but does not despise anyone; he is mighty and good in understanding. 6 He does not keep the wicked alive but grants justice to the afflicted. 7 He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but he sets them forever with kings on the throne, and they are exalted. 8 “And if they are tied up with fetters, if they are caught in the cords of misery, 9 then he declares their work to them, and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly. 10 So he opens their ear to the discipline, and he commands that they return from mischief. 11 If they listen and serve him, they complete their days in prosperity and their years in pleasantness. 12 But if they do not listen, they perish by the sword, and they pass away without knowledge. 13 And the godless of heart cherish anger; they do not cry for help when he binds them. 14 They die in their youth, and their life ends among the male shrine prostitutes. 15 He delivers the afflicted by his misery, and he opens their ears by the adversity. 16 And what’s more, he allured you out of distress into a broad place, where in place of it was no constraint; and what was set on your table is full of fatness. 17 But you are obsessed with the judgment of the wicked; judgment and justice take hold of you. 18 Yes, it is wrath, so that it will not incite you into mockery; and do not let the ransom’s greatness turn you aside. 19 Will your cry for help sustain you without distress, or all the efforts of your strength? 20 You must not long for the night, to cut off people in their place. 21 Take care, you must not turn to mischief, for because of this you have been tried by misery. 22 “Look, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him? 23 Who has prescribed his way for him? Or who says, ‘You have done wrong’? 24 Remember that you should extol his work, of which people have sung. 25 All human beings have looked on it; everyone watches from afar. 26 “Look, God is exalted, and we do not know him; the number of his years is unsearchable. 27 Indeed, he draws up the drops of water; he distills the rain into its mist, 28 which the clouds pour down; they shower abundantly on human beings. 29 “Moreover, can anyone understand the spreading of clouds, the thundering of his dwelling place? 30 Look, he scatters his lightning around him, and he covers the roots of the sea. 31 Indeed, he judges people by them; he gives food in abundance. 32 He covers his hands with lightning, and he commands it the place at which to strike. 33 His thundering tells about him; the livestock also tell concerning what rises. 1 “About this also my heart trembles, and it leaps from its place. 2 Listen carefully to his voice’s thunder and the rumbling that goes out from his mouth. 3 He lets it loose under all the heavens, and his lightning to the earth’s corners. 4 After it, his voice roars; it thunders with his majestic voice, and he does not restrain it when his voice is heard. 5 “God thunders with his voice in marvelous ways; he does great things, and we cannot comprehend. 6 For to the snow he says, ‘Fall on the earth’; and the shower of rain, his heavy shower of rain— 7 he stops all human beings from working so that everyone whom he has made may know it. 8 Then the animal goes into its den, and it remains in its den. 9 “The storm wind comes from its chamber and cold from the north wind. 10 By God’s breath, ice is given, and the broad waters are frozen. 11 Also, he loads down thick clouds with moisture; his lightning scatters the clouds. 12 And they turn around by his guidance to accomplish all that he has commanded them on the face of the habitable world. 13 Whether as correction or for his land, or as loyal love, he lets it happen. 14 “Hear this, Job; stand still and consider carefully God’s wondrous works. 15 Do you know how God commands them and how he causes his cloud’s lightning to shine? 16 Do you know about the hovering of the clouds, the marvelous works of the one with perfect knowledge? 17 You whose garments are hot, when the earth is being still because of the south wind, 18 with him can you spread out the skies, hard as a molten mirror? 19 “Teach us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of the presence of darkness. 20 Should he be told that I want to speak? Or did a man say that he would be communicated with? 21 So then, they do not look at the light when it is bright in the skies, when the wind has passed and has cleansed them. 22 From the north comes gold— awesome majesty is around God. 23 As for Shaddai, we cannot attain him; he is exalted in power, and he does not oppress justice and abundant righteousness. 24 Therefore people revered him; he does not regard any who think that they are wise.” 1 Then Yahweh answered Job from the storm, and he said, 2 “Who is this darkening counsel by words without knowledge? 3 Prepare yourself for a difficult task like a man, and I will question you, and you shall declare to me. 4 “Where were you at my laying the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you possess understanding. 5 Who determined its measurement? Yes, you do know. Or who stretched the measuring line upon it? 6 On what were its bases sunk? Or who laid its cornerstone, 7 when the morning stars were singing together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

Job,"8 “Or who shut the sea in with doors at its bursting, when it went out of the womb, 9 at my making the clouds its garment and thick darkness its swaddling band, 10 and I prescribed my rule for it, and I set bars and doors, 11 and I said, ‘You shall come up to here, but you shall not go further, and here it will set a boundary for your proud surging waves’? 12 “Have you ever in your life commanded the morning? Have you made the dawn know its place, 13 to take hold of the earth’s skirts so that the wicked might be shaken off from it? 14 It is changed like clay under a seal, and they appear like a garment. 15 And their light is withheld from the wicked, and their uplifted arm is broken. 16 “Have you entered into the sea’s sources? Or have you walked around in the recesses of the deep? 17 Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the gates of deep shadow? 18 Have you considered closely the earth’s vast expanse? Declare it, if you know all of it. 19 “Where then is the way where the light dwells? And where then is its place, 20 that you may take it to its territory, and that you might discern the paths to its home? 21 You know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great. 22 Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail, 23 which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war? 24 Where then is the way where the light is distributed, where he scatters the east wind upon the earth? 25 “Who has cut open a channel for the torrents and a way for the thunder bolts, 26 to bring rain on a land where no one lives, a desert where no humans live, 27 to satisfy desert and wasteland, and to cause the ground to put forth the rising of grass? 28 Is there a father for the rain, or who fathered the drops of dew? 29 From whose womb did the ice come forth, and who fathered the frost of heaven? 30 Like stone the waters become hard, and the faces of the deep freeze. 31 “Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades, or can you loosen the cords of Orion? 32 Can you lead forth the southern constellations at their appointed time, or can you lead the Bear with its children? 33 Do you know heaven’s statutes, or can you establish their rule on the earth? 34 Can you lift up your voice to the clouds so that a flood of water may cover you? 35 Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go? And will they say to you, ‘Here we are’? 36 Who has put wisdom in the ibis, or who has given understanding to the rooster? 37 Who can number the clouds with wisdom? Or who can tilt heaven’s jars, 38 at the flowing of the dust into a cast and the clods cling together? 39 “Can you hunt prey for the lion? And can you satisfy the hunger of strong lions 40 when they are crouched in the dens, when they lie in the thicket in an ambush? 41 Who prepares for the crow its prey, when its young ones cry to God for help, and they wander around for lack of food? 1 “Do you know the time when the goats of the rocks give birth? Do you observe the doe deer’s giving birth? 2 Can you number the months they fulfill, and do you know the time of its giving birth? 3 When they crouch, they bring forth their young ones; they get rid of their labor pains. 4 Their young ones grow strong; they grow up in the open; they go forth and do not return to them. 5 “Who has sent forth the wild ass free? And who has released the wild donkey’s bonds, 6 to which I have given the wilderness as its house and the salt flat as its dwelling place? 7 It scorns the city’s turmoil; it does not hear the driver’s shouts. 8 It explores the mountains as its pasture and searches after every kind of green plant. 9 “Is the wild ox willing to serve you, or will he spend the night at your feeding trough? 10 Can you tie the wild ox with its rope to a furrow, or will it harrow the valleys after you? 11 Can you trust it because its strength is great, or will you hand your labor over to it? 12 Can you rely on it that it will return your grain and that it will gather it to your threshing floor? 13 “The wings of the female ostrich flap— are they the pinions of the stork or the falcon? 14 Indeed, it leaves its eggs to the earth, and it lets them be warmed on the ground, 15 and it forgets that a foot might crush an egg, and a wild animal might trample it. 16 It deals cruelly with its young ones, as if they were not its own, as if without fear that its labor were in vain, 17 because God made it forget wisdom, and he did not give it a share in understanding. 18 When it spreads its wings aloft, it laughs at the horse and its rider. 19 “Do you give power to the horse? Do you clothe its neck with a mane? 20 Do you make it leap like the locust? The majesty of its snorting is terrifying. 21 They paw in the valley, and it exults with strength; it goes out to meet the battle. 22 It laughs at danger and is not dismayed, and it does not turn back from before the sword. 23 Upon it the quiver rattles along with the flash of the spear and the short sword. 24 With roar and rage it races over the ground, and it cannot stand still at the sound of the horn. 25 Whenever a horn sounds, it says, ‘Aha!’ And it smells the battle from a distance— the thunder of the commanders and the war cry. 26 “Does the hawk soar by your wisdom? Does it spread its wings to the south? 27 Or does the eagle fly high at your command and construct its nest high? 28 It lives on the rock and spends the night on the rock point and the mountain stronghold. 29 From there it spies out the prey; its eyes look from far away. 30 And its young ones lick blood greedily, and where the dead carcasses are, there they are.” 1 Then Yahweh answered Job and said, 2 “Shall a faultfinder contend with Shaddai? Anyone who argues with God must answer it.” 3 So Job answered Yahweh and said, 4 “Look, I am insignificant. What shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth. 5 Once I have spoken, and I will not answer; even twice, but I will not proceed.” 6 Then Yahweh answered Job from the storm, and he said, 7 “Prepare yourself for a difficult task like a man, and I will question you, and you shall declare to me. 8 “Indeed, would you annul my justice? Would you condemn me, so that you might be righteous? 9 Or do you have an arm like God, and can you thunder with a voice like his? 10 Adorn yourself with pride and dignity, and clothe yourself with splendor. 11 Pour out the overflowing of your anger, and look at all the proud, and humble them. 12 Look at all the proud, humble them, and tread down the wicked where they stand. 13 Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in the grave. 14 And I will also praise you, that your own right hand can save you. 15 “Look, Behemoth, which I have made just as I made you; it eats grass like the ox. 16 Look, its strength is in its loins and its power in the muscles of its stomach. 17 It keeps its tail straight like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are tightly wound. 18 Its bones are tubes of copper, its limbs like rods of iron. 19 “It is the first of God’s actions; the one who made him furnishes it with his sword. 20 Yes, the mountains yield produce for it, and all wild animals play there. 21 Under the lotus tree it lies, in the hiding place of the reeds and in the marsh. 22 The lotus trees cover it with their shade; the wadi’s poplar trees surround it. 23 Look, if the river is turbulent, it is not frightened; it is confident even though the Jordan rushes against its mouth. 24 Can anyone take it by its eyes? Can he pierce its nose with a snare? 1 “Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook? Or can you tie down its mouth with a cord? 2 Can you put a rope in its nose? Or can you pierce its jawbone with a hook? 3 Will it make numerous pleas for mercy to you? Or will it speak gentle words to you? 4 Will it make a covenant with you? Will you take it as a slave forever? 5 Will you play with it as with birds and put it on a leash for your girls? 6 Will guildsmen bargain over it? Will they divide it between tradesmen? 7 Can you fill its kin with harpoons or its head with fish spears? 8 Lay your hands on it; think about the battle—you will not do it again! 9 “Look, the hope of capturing it is false. Will one be hurled down even at its sight? 10 Is it not fierce when somebody stirs it? Who then is he who would stand before it? 11 Who has come to confront me, that I should repay him? Under all the heavens, it belongs to me. 12 “I will not keep quiet concerning its limbs or concerning the extent of its might and the gracefulness of its frame. 13 Who can strip off its outer covering? Who can penetrate its double harness? 14 Who can open the doors of its face? Its teeth all around are fearsome. 15 Its back has scales of shields; it is shut up closely as with a seal. 16 They are close to one another— even the air cannot come between them. 17 They are joined one to another; they cling together and cannot be separated. 18 “Its snorting flashes forth light, and its eyes are red like dawn. 19 Torches go from its mouth; sparks of fire shoot out. 20 Smoke comes from its nostrils as from a kettle boiling and burning bulrushes. 21 Its breath kindles charcoal, and a flame comes from its mouth. 22 “Strength abides in its neck, and dismay dances before it. 23 Its flesh’s folds of skin cling together; it is cast on it—it will not be moved. 24 Its heart is cast as stone; yes, it is cast as the lower millstone. 25 When it raises itself, the mighty ones are terrified; they retreat because of its thrashing. 26 Reaching it with the sword does not avail, nor with the spear, the dart, or the javelin. 27 It regards iron as straw, bronze as rotten wood. 28 An arrow will not make it flee; sling stones are turned to stubble for it. 29 Clubs are regarded as stubble, and it laughs at the short sword’s rattle. 30 “Its underparts are shards of a potsherd; it moves over mud like a threshing sledge. 31 It makes the deep boil like a cooking pot; it makes the sea like a pot of ointment. 32 Behind it, it leaves a glistening wake; one would think that the deep has gray hair. 33 “On the ground it has no equal— a creature without fear. 34 It observes all the lofty; it is king over all that are proud.” 1 Then Job answered Yahweh and said, 2 “I know that you can do all things, and any scheme from you will not be thwarted. 3 ‘Who is this darkening counsel without knowledge?’ Therefore I uttered, but I did not understand; things too wonderful for me, but I did not know. 4 ‘Hear and I will speak; I will question you, then inform me.’ 5 By the ear’s hearing I heard of you, but now my eye has seen you. 6 Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.” 7 And then after Yahweh spoke these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath has been kindled against you and against the two of your friends, for you have not spoken to me what is right as my servant Job has. 8 So then, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job will pray for you, for I will certainly accept his prayer, so that it will not be done with you according to your folly, for you have not spoken to me what is right as my servant Job has.” 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did just as Yahweh had told them, and Yahweh accepted Job’s prayer. 10 Then Yahweh returned Job’s fortune when he prayed to him on behalf of his friends. Thus Yahweh increased all that Job had twice as much as before. 11 So all his brothers and all his sisters and all those who had known him before came to him, and they ate bread with him in his house and showed sympathy to him and comforted him for all the disaster that Yahweh had brought upon him. Then each one gave to him one piece of money, and each one gave to him one ornamental ring of gold. 12 So Yahweh blessed Job’s latter days more than his beginning. Thus he had fourteen thousand sheep and goats and six thousand camels and a thousand pair of oxen and a thousand female donkeys. 13 And he had seven sons and three daughters. 14 And he called the name of the first Jemimah and the name of the second Keziah and the name of the third Qeren-Happuk. 15 And beautiful women were not found in all the land like Job’s daughters, and their father gave to them an inheritance in the midst of their brothers. 16 And Job lived after this one hundred and forty years, and he saw his sons and his grandsons for four generations. 17 Then Job died old and full of days.

Esther,"1 And it happened in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Cush—over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces. 2 In those days as King Ahasuerus was sitting on the throne of his kingdom, which was in the citadel of Susa, 3 he gave a banquet in the third year of his reign for all his officials and servants.

Esther,"4 as he displayed the wealth of the glory of his kingdom and the glorious splendor of his greatness for many days, one hundred and eighty days. 5 And when those days were completed, the king gave for all the people that were present at the citadel of Susa, both great and small, a banquet in the courtyard of the king’s palace garden that lasted seven days. 6 There were curtains of finely woven linen and blue cloth tied with cords of fine white linen and purple cloth to silver curtain rings and pillars of alabaster, and couches of gold and silver on a paved floor of alabaster, precious stone, mother-of-pearl, and costly stones. 7 Drinks were served in goblets of gold and goblets of different kinds, and there was plentiful royal wine according to the bounty of the king. 8 There were no restrictions on the drinking, for the king had instructed every official of his palace to do as each one pleased. 9 Furthermore, Queen Vashti gave a banquet for the women in the palace that belonged to King Ahasuerus. 10 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he said to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, seven of the eunuchs attending King Ahasuerus, 11 to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown to show the people and the officials her beauty, for she was very attractive. 12 But Queen Vashti refused to come at the word of the king that was conveyed by the eunuchs. And the king became very angry, and his anger burned in him. 13 And the king said to the wise men, the ones who know the times—for it was the procedure of the king before all those who knew law and rights; 14 and those next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, Memucan, the seven officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king and sat first in the kingdom— 15 “According to the law, what is to be done with Queen Vashti, because she has not done the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed by the eunuchs? 16 And Memucan said before the king and the officials, “Not only has Queen Vashti done wrong to the king, but to all the officials and all of the people who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. 17 For this deed of the queen will be known to all the women, causing them to look with contempt on their husbands, as they will say, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him but she did not come!’ 18 This day the women of nobility from Persia and Media who have heard this deed of the queen will respond the same way to all the officials of the king and there will be no end to contempt and anger. 19 If it pleases the king, let a royal edict go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media so that it will not be altered, that Vashti cannot come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to her neighbor who is better than she. 20 And let the king’s decree that he will make be proclaimed in all his kingdom, because it is vast and all the women will honor their husbands, great and small.” 21 This advice pleased the king and the officials, and the king acted according to the word of Memucan. 22 And he sent letters to all the provinces of the king, to each province according to its own script, and to every people in their own language, that every man should be the master of his house and who speaks in the language of his people. 1 After these things, when the anger of King Ahasuerus subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her. 2 And the king’s servants attending him said, “Let them seek attractive young virgins for the king. 3 Let the king appoint chief officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, and let them gather every attractive young virgin to the harem in the citadel of Susa under the care of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let him give them their beauty treatment.

Esther,"4 And let the young woman who is pleasing in the king’s eyes become queen in place of Vashti. The thing was good in the king’s eyes, and he acted accordingly. 5 There was a Jew in the citadel of Susa whose name was Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite, 6 who was deported from Jerusalem with the exiles who were deported with Jeconiah the king of Judah, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had deported. 7 He was raising Hadassah, that is Esther, his uncle’s daughter, for she did not have a father or a mother; the young woman had a beautiful figure and was very attractive. When her father and mother died, Mordecai had taken her as his daughter. 8 And it happened, at the proclaiming of the edict of the king and his law, when many young women were being gathered to the citadel of Susa under Hegai’s care, Esther was taken to the king’s palace under the care of Hegai who was in charge of the women. 9 The young woman pleased him and she won favor in his presence, and he quickly provided for her beauty treatment and her portion of food, with seven chosen maids to give to her from the king’s palace, and he advanced her and her maids to the best part of the harem. 10 Esther did not disclose her people and her family because Modecai had charged her that she must not tell. 11 And every day Modecai would walk up and down in front of the courtyard of the harem to learn how Esther was doing. 12 When the turn came for each girl to go to King Ahasuerus, after the end of twelve months of being under the regulations of the women—for the days of their beauty treatments had to be filled, six months with the oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and women’s cosmetics—13 in this way, the girl goes to the king and all that she asks is given to her to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace. 14 In the evening she would go and in the morning she would return to the second harem under the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch in charge of the concubines. She would not go back to the king unless the king delighted in her and she was called by name. 15 When the turn came near for Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as a daughter, to go to the king, she did not ask anything except what Hegai the eunuch of the king who was in charge of the women, advised. And Esther carried favor in the eyes of everyone that saw her.

Esther,"16 Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, to his palace, in the tenth month that is Tebeth in the seventh year of his reign. 17 And the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won his favor and loyalty more than all the virgins, so he put a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. 18 And the king gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his officials and servants. And he granted a tax amnesty to the provinces and he gave gifts with royal liberality. 19 When the virgins were gathered a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the gate of the king. 20 Esther had not made known her family and her people, just as Mordecai had instructed her; for Esther did what Mordecai told her, just as when she was brought up by him. 21 In those days Mordecai was sitting at the gate of the king. Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs from the keepers of the threshold, became angry and they conspired to assassinate King Ahasuerus. 22 And the matter became known to Mordecai and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told it to the king in the name of Mordecai. 23 And the matter was investigated and found to be so; and the two of them were hanged on the gallows, and it was written in the scroll of the events of the days before the presence of the king. 1 After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and he exalted him and set his position above all the officials who were with him. 2 And all of the king’s servants who were at the gate of the king were kneeling and bowing down to Haman; for so the king had commanded concerning him, but Mordecai did not kneel and bow down. 3 And the king’s servants who were at the gate of the king said to Mordecai, “Why are you transgressing the command of the king?” 4 They spoke to him day after day, but he did not listen to them, and they informed Haman to see if Mordecai’s resolve would prevail; for he had told them that he was a Jew. 5 And Haman saw that Mordecai was not kneeling and bowing down to him, and he was filled with wrath. 6 But he considered it beneath him to lay hands on Mordecai only, for they told him of Mordecai’s people, and Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were in the kingdom of Ahasuerus.

Esther,"7 In the first month, that is, the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasurus, he cast pur—that is, the lot—before the presence of Haman for the day and for the month, until the twelfth month, that is, the month of Adar. 8 And Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered and separated among the peoples in all of the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from every other people, and they do not observe the laws of the king; it is not appropriate for the king to tolerate them. 9 If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to those who do the job, to bring to the treasury of the king.” 10 So the king removed his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. 11 And the king said to Haman, “The money is given to you and to the people to do with it as you see fit. 12 And the king’s secretaries were called in the first month on the thirteenth day, and a decree was issued, according to all that Haman commanded, to the satraps of the king and to the governors who were over all the provinces, and to the officials of all the people, to each province according to its own script and to all people according to their own language; it was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and was sealed with the king’s ring. 13 Letters were sent by couriers to all the provinces of the king to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, women and children, on one day, the thirteenth day of the month, that is Adar, and to plunder their goods. 14 A copy of the edict was presented as law in every province making it known to all the people to be ready for that day. 15 The couriers went out quickly by order of the king, and the law was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; and the city of Susa was bewildered. 1 Mordecai learned all that had been done and he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes. And he went through the middle of the city and cried out a loud and bitter cry; 2 he went up to the entrance of the gate of the king, for he could not go to the gate of the king in sackcloth.

Esther,"3 In every province each place where the king’s edict and his law came, there was great mourning for the Jews with fasting, crying, wailing, and sackcloth; and ashes were spread out as a bed for them. 4 And Esther’s maids and her eunuchs came and they told her, and the queen was deeply distressed; she sent garments to clothe Mordecai so that he might remove his sackcloth—but he did not accept them. 5 Then Esther called Hathach from the king’s eunuchs who regularly attended to her, and she ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what was happening and why. 6 So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to the public square of the city, which was in front of the gate of the king, 7 and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact amount of money that Haman has promised to pay to the treasury of the king for the destruction of the Jews. 8 And he gave him a copy of the edict of the law that had been issued in Susa for their destruction to show Esther, and to inform her, and to charge her to go to the king and make supplication to him and entreat before him for her people. 9 And Hathach went back and told Esther the words of Mordecai. 10 And Esther spoke to Hathach and she gave him a message for Mordecai: 11 “All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that if any man or woman who goes to the king to the inner courtyard, who is not called, he has one law, to be killed, except if the king extends to him the gold scepter so that he may live. I have not been called to come to the king for thirty days.” 12 And they told Mordecai the words of Esther. 13 Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther: “Do not think that your life will be saved in the palace of the king more than all the Jews. 14 For if indeed you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, and you and the family of your father will perish. Who knows? Perhaps you have come to a royal position for a time such as this.” 15 Esther replied to Mordecai: 16 “Go, gather all the Jews that are found in Susa and fast for me; do not eat or drink for three days, both night and day. I and my young girls will fast likewise, and then I will go to the king, which is not according to the law; if I perish, I perish. 17 And Mordecai went away and he did everything that Esther commanded him. 1 And it happened, on the third day, and Esther put on royal clothes, and she stood in the inner courtyard of the king’s palace, opposite the king’s palace; the king was sitting on his royal throne in the throne room opposite the doorway of the palace. 2 When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard she found favor in his eyes, and the king held out the gold scepter that was in his hand to Esther, and Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter. 3 And the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It will be given to you—even half the kingdom.” 4 And Esther said, “If it is good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.” ",Esther 4:3-5:4,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/esther-43-54-26826/direct-download/tbd20080523.mp3
Esther,"5 And the king said, “Bring Haman quickly to fulfill the request of Esther.” So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 6 And the king said to Esther while they were drinking wine, “What is your petition? It will be given to you. What is your request? Even half the kingdom, it will done. 7 And Esther answered and said, “This is my petition and my request. 8 If I have found favor in the eyes of the king, and if it is good to the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them tomorrow, and I will do according to the word of the king. 9 And Haman went out on that day rejoicing and feeling good. But when Haman saw Mordecai at the gate of the king, and he did not rise or tremble before him, Haman was filled with rage toward Mordecai. 10 But Haman controlled himself and went to his house, and he sent for and brought his friends and Zeresh his wife. 11 And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his wealth and the number of his sons and all the ways that the king had honored him and promoted him above the officials and king’s servants. 12 And Haman added, “Esther the Queen did not let just anyone come to the banquet that she prepared with the king except me, and I am also invited tomorrow to her banquet with the king. 13 But all this fails to satisfy me when I see Mordecai the Jew setting at the gate of the king.” 14 And Zeresh his wife and all of his friends said to him, “Let them make a gallows fifty cubits high, and in the morning tell the king, “Let them hang Mordecai on it; then go with the king to the banquet happily.” The advice pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made. 1 During that night the king’s sleep escaped him, and he gave orders to bring the scroll of records and chronicles, and they were read before the king. 2 And it was found written how Mordecai had reported concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs from the keepers of the threshold who had conspired to assassinate King Ahasuerus. 3 And the king asked, “What has been done to bestow honor to Mordecai for this?” And the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.” 4 And the king asked, “Who is in the courtyard?” Haman had just come to the courtyard of the king’s outer palace to tell the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. 5 And the king’s servants said to him, “Look! Haman is standing in the courtyard.” And the king said, “Let him come.” 6 And Haman came, and the king said to him, “What is to be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?” And Haman thought to himself, “Whom would the king wish to honor more than me?” 7 So Haman said to the king, “For a man whom the king wishes to honor, 8 let them bring royal clothing with which the king has clothed himself, and a horse that the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal head-dress has been given.

Esther,"7 So Haman said to the king, “For a man whom the king wishes to honor, 8 let them bring royal clothing with which the king has clothed himself, and a horse that the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal head-dress has been given. 9 And let the clothing and the horse be given to the man by the officials of the king’s nobles; let them cloth the man whom the king wishes to honor, and let him ride on his horse through the public square of the city, and let them proclaim before him, ‘Thus, it will be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor.’ ” 10 Then the king said to Haman, “Quickly, take the clothing and the horse, just as you have said, and do so to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the gate of the king; you must not leave out anything from what you have said.” 11 So Haman took the clothing and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai and let him ride through the public square of the city; and he proclaimed before him, “Thus, it is done to the man whom the king wishes to honor.” 12 Then Mordecai returned to the gate of the king, and Haman rushed to his house mournful and with his head covered. 13 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends all that had happened to him. And his advisers and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is from the descendants of the Jews, you will not prevail against him, but will certainly fall before him.” 14 As they were still speaking with him the king’s eunuchs arrived and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 1 So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther. 2 And the king again said to Esther, on the second day while they were drinking, “What is your petition, Queen Esther? It will be given to you. What is your request? It will be given to you—even half the kingdom.” 3 Then Queen Esther answered, and she said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, O king, and if it is good to the king, let my life be given to me at my petition and my people at my request; 4 I and my people have been sold to be destroyed and killed, to be annihilated. If we had been sold as male and female slaves I would have kept quiet, because this is not a need sufficient to trouble the king.” 5 And King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who gave himself the right to do this?” 6 And Esther said, “The adversary and enemy is this evil Haman!” And Haman was terrified before the king and queen. 7 The king rose in his anger from the banquet and went to the palace garden, and Haman stood to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he realized that the king was determined to make an end to his life. 8 And the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, where Haman was lying prostrate on the couch that Esther was on, and the king said, “Will he also molest the queen with me in the house?” As the words went from the king’s mouth they covered Haman’s face. 9 And Habrona, one of the eunuchs in the presence of the king, said, “Look, the same gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai who spoke good for the sake of the king stands at Haman’s house, fifty cubits high.” And the king said, “Hang him on it.” 10 And they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai, and the anger of the king was abated.

Esther,"1 On that day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews; and Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her. 2 And the king removed his signet ring that he had taken away from Haman, and he gave it to Mordecai. So Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. 3 And Esther again spoke before the king, and she fell before his feet and wept, pleading for his grace to avert Haman the Agagite’s evil plan and the plot that he devised against the Jews. 4 And the king held out to Esther the scepter of gold, and Esther rose and stood before the king, 5 and she said, “If it is good to the king, and if I have found favor before him, and if the king is pleased with this matter, and I have his approval, let an edict be written to revoke the letters of the plans of Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the provinces of the king. 6 For how can I bear to look on the disaster that will find my people, and how can I bear to look on the destruction of my family?” 7 And King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Look, I have given Haman’s house to Esther, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he plotted against the Jews. 8 Write as you see fit concerning the Jews in the name of the king, and seal it with the king’s signet ring; for a decree that is written in the name of the king and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be revoked.” 9 And the secretaries of the king were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is in the month of Sivan on the twenty-third day, and an edict was written according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews and to the governors and satraps and officials of the provinces from India to Cush—one hundred and twenty-seven provinces—each province according to its own script and to every people in their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language. 10 And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and he sealed the letters with the king’s signet ring and sent them by couriers on horses, riding on royal horses bred by racing mares. 11 In them the king allowed the Jews who were in every city to assemble and defend their lives, to destroy and kill and annihilate any army of any people or province attacking them, including women and children, and to plunder their spoil, 12 in one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. 13 A copy of the edict was to be given as law in each province to inform all the people, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves from their enemies. 14 The mounted couriers on the royal horses went out without delay, urged by the king’s word. The law was given in the citadel of Susa. 15 Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue cloth and white linen, and a great crown of gold and a robe of fine white linen and purple, and the city of Susa was shouting and rejoicing. 16 For the Jews, there was light and gladness, joy and honor. 17 In every province and city, wherever the king’s edict and his law came, there was gladness and joy for the Jews, a banquet and a holiday, and many of the people from the country were posing as Jews because the fear of the Jews had fallen on them.

Esther,"1 In the twelfth month, that is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day, on which the edict of the king arrived and his law was enacted, on the day in which the enemies of the Jews had hoped to gain power over them but was overturned, and the Jews gained power against their enemies, 2 the Jews gathered in their cities in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike against those who sought their destruction, and no one could withstand them, as the fear of them fell on all the people. 3 All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, governors, and those who did the work of the king were supporting the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them. 4 For Mordecai was high-ranking in the king’s palace and his fame spread throughout all the provinces as Mordecai grew more and more powerful. 5 The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them; and they did as they pleased with those that hated them. 6 And in the citadel of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men,7 and Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 8 Portha, Adalia, Aridatha, 9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 10 the ten sons of Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews; but they did not touch the plunder. 11 On that day the number of those being killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king. 12 And the king said to Queen Esther, “In the citadel of Susa the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? What is your petition? It will be granted to you. And what further is your request? It will be done.” 13 Esther replied, “If it is good to the king, let tomorrow also be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do according to the edict of today; and let them hang Haman’s ten sons on the gallows.” 14 And the king said to do so. And a decree was issued in Susa and Haman’s ten sons were hanged. 15 And the Jews were gathered who were in Susa, and on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they killed in Susa three hundred men, but they did not touch the plunder. 16 The rest of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered and defended their lives and found repose from their enemies. And they killed seventy-five thousand of those that hated them, but they did not touch the plunder. 17 This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. They rested on the fourteenth day and made it a day of feasting and joy. 18 But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day, and rested on the fifteenth day. And they made it a day of feasting and joy. 19 Therefore the Jews in the rural areas, living in the rural towns, made the fourteenth month of Adar a day of joy and feasting, a festive day of giving gifts to each other. 20 Mordecai wrote down these things and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all of the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, 21 to impose on them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and the fifteenth day, every year, 22 as the day that the Jews found relief from their enemies, and the month which changed for them from sorrow to joy, and from a mourning ceremony to a festive day; to make them days of feasting and joy, and giving gifts to each other and to the poor. 23 And the Jews adopted what they had begun to do and what Mordecai had written to them. 24 For Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and he had cast pur, that is the lot, to rout them out and destroy them. 25 But when it came to the attention of the king, he gave orders in writing that his evil plot that he had devised against the Jews should return on his head, and they hung him and his sons on the gallows. 26 Therefore they called these days Purim, because of the name Pur. Thus because of all the words of this letter, and of what they faced concerning this, and of what had happened to them, 27 the Jews established and adopted it for themselves and for their offspring, and for all who joined them. They did not neglect to observe these two days every year as it was written and appointed to them. 28 These days are to be remembered and are to be kept in every generation, and in family, province, and city; and these days of Purim are not to be neglected among the Jews, and their memory shall not come to an end among their offspring. 29 So Queen Esther the daughter of Abihail and Mordecai the Jew wrote in full authority to confirm this second letter of Purim. 30 He sent letters of words of peace and truth to all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of Ahasuerus’ kingdom, 31 to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had imposed, and just as they had imposed on themselves and their offspring regulations of the fast and their lament. 32 And the command of Esther established these practices of Purim, and it was written on the scroll. 1 King Ahasuerus imposed forced labor on the land and islands of the sea. 2 All the work of his authority and his powerful deeds, and the full accounting of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written on the scroll of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? 3 For Mordecai the Jew was second-in-command to King Ahasuerus. He was great for the Jews and popular with many of his brothers, for he sought good for his people, interceding for the welfare of all his descendants.

Ezra,"1 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to accomplish the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah, Yahweh stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia and he sent a message to all of his kingdom and also put the message in writing: 2 “Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: Yahweh, the God of the heavens, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth.

Ezra,"2 “Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: Yahweh, the God of the heavens, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. And he himself has appointed me to build a house for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. 3 Whoever among you who is from all of his people, may his God be with him and may he go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and may he build the house of Yahweh, the God of Israel. He is the God who is in Jerusalem. 4 And let every survivor, from wherever he resides be assisted by the men of that place with silver and gold, with possessions and domestic animals, and with the freewill offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.” 5 So the heads of the families for Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites—to all whose spirit God had stirred—prepared to go up and build the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem. 6 And all of their neighbors helped them with objects of silver, gold, possessions, domestic animals, and with valuable gifts—besides all of the freewill offering. 7 And Cyrus the king brought out the objects of the house of Yahweh that Nebuchadnezzar had brought from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods. 8 Cyrus the king of Persia let them go out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and he counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah. 9 Now these were the inventories: thirty gold metal dishes, one thousand silver metal dishes, twenty-nine vessels, 10 thirty bowls of gold, four hundred and ten matching silver metal bowls, and one thousand other objects. 11 All of the objects of gold and silver metal were five thousand four hundred. All this Sheshbazzar brought up along with the exiles from Babylonia to Jerusalem. 1 Now these were the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exile whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon carried captive to Babylonia. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city. 2 They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel: 3 the descendants of Parosh, two thousand one hundred and seventy-two; 4 the descendants of Shephatiah, three hundred and seventy-two; 5 the descendants of Arah, seven hundred and seventy-five;

and they had two hundred male and female singers. 66 Their horses numbered seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules numbered two hundred and forty-five, 67 their camels numbered four hundred and thirty-five, their donkeys numbered six thousand seven hundred and twenty. 68 When some of the heads of families came to the house of Yahweh that is in Jerusalem, they gave freewill offerings for the house of God to erect it on its place. 69 According to their ability they gave to the treasury room for the work sixty-one thousand darics of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly tunics. 70 The priests, the Levites, and some of the people lived in Jerusalem, and the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.

Ezra,"1 Now the seventh month drew near and the Israelites were in the cities, so the people gathered as one in Jerusalem. 2 And Jeshua son of Jehozadak and his brothers the priests stood up, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers built the altar of the God of Israel, in order to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God. 3 They set up the altar on its foundations, because they were in terror because of the peoples of the lands. And they offered burnt offerings on it for Yahweh, burnt offerings for the morning and the evening. 4 And they kept the feast of booths, as it is written, and offered burnt offerings day by day in number according to the ordinance as described for each day. 5 After this, they presented the daily sacrifice of burnt offerings, the offerings for the New Moon Festival, and for all of the appointed times consecrated for Yahweh and for all who gave a freewill offering to Yahweh. 6 From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh. But the temple of Yahweh was not yet founded. 7 So they gave money to the stone craftsmen and skilled craftsmen, and food, drink, and olive oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the authorization over them of Cyrus king of Persia. 8 In the second year after their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jehozadak began their work, and the remainder of their brothers the priests and the Levites and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem. They appointed the Levites from twenty years and older to direct the work of the house of Yahweh. 9 And Jeshua with his sons and brothers, and Kadmiel and his sons—the sons of Judah—together directed the workers in the house of God, along with the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers the Levites. 10 And the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Yahweh, and the priests in their apparel with the trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with the cymbals, were positioned to praise Yahweh, as described by King David of Israel. 11 And they sang responsively, with praising and thanksgiving to Yahweh saying, “For he is good, for his loyal love is everlasting for Israel.” And all of the people responded with a great shout of joyful acclaim in praise to Yahweh because the house of Yahweh was laid. 12 But many of the elderly priests, Levites, and heads of the families who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house, but many shouted aloud with joy. 13 No person could distinguish the sound of joyful acclaim from the sound of people weeping, for the people shouted with great joyful acclaim and the sound was heard from afar. 1 Now the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple for Yahweh the God of Israel. 2 And they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the families, and they said to them, “Let us build with you. Like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him from the days of Esarhaddon the king of Assyria who brought us up here. 3 But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel said to them, “It is not for you but for us to build a house for our God. For we ourselves alone will build it for Yahweh the God of Israel, just as Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.” 4 Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah and made them afraid to build 5 and bribed officials against them to frustrate their plan for all the days of Cyrus king of Persia until the reign of Darius king of Persia. 6 In the reign of Ahasuerus, at the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. 7 And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their colleagues wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. The letter was written in Aramaic and translated from Aramaic. 8 Rehum the royal officer and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows 9 (then Rehum the royal officer, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the judges, the envoys, the officials, the Persians, the Erechs, the Babylonians, the Susians (that is the Elamites) 10 and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and the rest of the province Beyond the River) and now 11 this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him: “To King Artaxerxes from your servants, the men of the province Beyond the River. And now, 12 be it known to the king that the Jews who have come up from near you to us have gone to Jerusalem. They are building the rebellious and wicked city. They are finishing the wall and repairing the foundation. 13 Now be it known to the king that if this city is built and the walls are finished, they will not pay tribute and toll, and the royal revenue will be reduced. 14 Now since we eat the salt of the palace and the dishonor of the king is not proper for us to see, we send and make this known to the king, 15 so that it may be investigated in the book of records of your ancestors. You will find in the book of records and learn that this city is a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces, and they have rebelled in its midst from ancient times. Because of that this city was destroyed. 16 We make known to the king that if this city is built and the walls are finished, you will have nothing in the province Beyond the River.” 17 The king sent a reply: “To Rehum the royal officer, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and the rest of the province Beyond the River, greetings. And now 18 the letter that you sent to us has been translated and read before me. 19 And I issued a decree, and they searched and found that this city from ancient days revolted against kings, and rebellion and sedition has been made in it. 20 Mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem, governing all the province Beyond the River, to whom tribute, duty, and tax has been given. 21 So now, issue forth a decree that these men stop and this city not be built, until a decree is issued from me. 22 And be careful not to be negligent on this matter. Why should damage grow to hurt kings?” 23 Then when a copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates they returned in a hurry to Jerusalem against the Jews and they stopped them by force and power. 24 Then the work on the house of God in Jerusalem stopped, and was discontinued until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

Ezra,"1 Now the prophets, Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and in Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them. 2 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak set out and began to build the house of God that is in Jerusalem. And with them the prophets of God were helping them. 3 At the same time Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their associates came to them and spoke to them thus: “Who issued you all a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?” 4 Then we asked them this: “What are the names of the men who are building this building?” 5 And the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until the report came to Darius, and then answer was received. 6 The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and his associates the envoys who were in the province Beyond the River sent to Darius the king. 7 They sent to him the report in which was written as follows: “To Darius the king, all peace. 8 May it be known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, the house of the great God. It is being built with stone blocks and timber is being put in the walls. This work is being done with diligence and is making progress in their hands. 9 Then we asked those elders and said this to them, ‘Who issued forth to you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?’ 10 We also asked them their names to make them known to you, that we might write down the name of their leaders. 11 And this is the answer they returned to us: ‘We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building the house that was built formerly many years ago, which a great king of Israel had built and finished. 12 But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he gave them into the hand of the Chaldean King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. He destroyed this house and carried away the people to Babylonia. 13 But in the first year of King Cyrus of Babylon’s reign he issued forth a decree to build this house of God. 14 Also, the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took away from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple in Babylonia, King Cyrus removed them from the temple in Babylonia and they were given to Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed governor. 15 He said to him, ‘Take these vessels. Go put them in the temple in Jerusalem and let the house of God be built on its site.’ 16 Then this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem. And from that time until now it is being built, but not yet finished.’ 17 And now, if it seems good for the king, let it be investigated in the house of the treasury of the king in Babylonia to see if a decree was issued forth from King Cyrus to build this house of God in Jerusalem. And let the king send to us his desire on this matter.” 1 Then King Darius issued forth a decree, and they searched the house of the treasury of scrolls being stored in Babylonia. 2 But it was in Ecbatana in the province of Media, in the citadel, that a certain scroll had written on it, “A record. 3 In the first year of King Cyrus, he issued forth a decree concerning the house of God in Jerusalem. Let the house be built, the place where sacrifices are offered and let its foundations be raised. Its height shall be sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits, 4 with three layers of great stones and a layer of timber. Let the new expenses be paid from the house of the king. 5 Also, let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylonia, be returned and brought to the temple in Jerusalem to its place. Put them in the house of God.” 6 “Now then, Tattenai governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates, the envoys who are in the province Beyond the River—keep far away from there. 7 Leave this work of the house of God alone. Let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site. 8 And I issue forth a decree for what you should do for these elders of the Jews to build this house of God. The full expense will be paid to these men from the riches of the king from the taxes of the province Beyond the River, without delay. 9 Whatever may be needed—young bulls, young rams, sheep for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil for the priests in Jerusalem—let it be given to them day by day with no negligence, 10 that they may offer incense offerings to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and his children. 11 Furthermore, I issue forth a decree that if any person violates this decree, let a beam be pulled out from his house and let him be impaled on it. And let his house be made a pile of rubble on account of this. 12 May the God who has set his name there overthrow any king or people who sets his hand to alter or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, issue forth a decree. Let it be done with diligence.” 13 Then Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates consequently did with diligence what Darius the king ordered. 14 So the elders of the Jews were building and prospering, through the prophecy of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo. They finished building by the command of the God of Israel and by the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and King Artaxerxes of Persia. 15 This house was completed on the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. 16 And the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the returned exiles celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy. 17 And they offered during the dedication of this house of God one hundred young bulls, two hundred young rams, four hundred lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering for Israel according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 18 Then they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their sections for the work of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses. 19 On the fourteenth day of the first month the returned exiles observed the Passover feast. 20 For the priests and Levites together had consecrated themselves; all of them were clean. And they slaughtered the Passover sacrifice for all of the returned exiles, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves. 21 The Israelites who returned from the exile and all those who separated themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the earth to seek Yahweh the God of Israel, ate. 22 With joy they celebrated the festival of unleavened bread for seven days, because Yahweh had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them in order to help them with the work of their hands on the house of the God of Israel.

The king granted him all his requests, for the hand of Yahweh was upon him. 7 Some of the Israelites, some priests and Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes. 8 He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. 9 For on the first day of the first month he began the journey from Babylonia; and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was on him. 10 For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Yahweh, to do it, and to teach the regulations and judgments in Israel. 11 This is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the scroll of the words of the commands of Yahweh and his statutes for Israel: 12 “Artaxerxes, the king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of the heavens. Peace. And now 13 I issue forth a decree that any of the people of Israel, their priests, or their Levites in my kingdom who are willing to go to Jerusalem may go with you. 14 For you are sent from the king and his seven counselors to enquire about Judah and Jerusalem concerning the law of your God, which is in your hand. 15 Also, bring the silver and gold that the king and his advisors have freely offered to the God of Israel whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, 16 and all of the silver and gold that you will find in the whole province of Babylonia, with the freewill offerings of the people and the priests giving willingly for the house of their God in Jerusalem. 17 With this money, then, with diligence you must buy young bulls, young rams, lambs, and their offerings and libations. You must offer them on the altar that is in the house of your God in Jerusalem. 18 You may do whatever seems best to you and your brothers to do with the remainder of the silver and gold according to the desire of your God. 19 And the vessels that were given to you for the service of the house of your God you shall deliver before the God of Jerusalem. 20 And the remainder of the needs for the house of your God that falls to you to provide, you may provide from the house of the king’s treasury.” 21 “I, even I, King Artaxerxes, issue forth a decree to all the treasurers who are in the province Beyond the River. Whatever the priest Ezra, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, may ask of you, let it be done with diligence, 22 up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred measures of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and unlimited salt. 23 All that is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done with diligence for the house of the God of heaven, otherwise wrath will come on the kingdom of the king and his sons. 24 You also should be aware that it is not permitted to place tax, tribute, or duty upon all of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the doorkeepers, the temple servants, and other servants of the house of God. 25 “You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that you possess, appoint magistrates and judges who can judge all of the people in the province Beyond the River who know the laws of your God. And you will teach those who do not know. 26 All who do not obey the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed on him with diligence, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of goods and for imprisonment.” 27 Blessed be Yahweh the God of our ancestors, who put this in the heart of the king to glorify the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem 28 and who extended to me loyal love before the king and his counselors, and before all of the mighty officials of the king. I took courage, for the hand of Yahweh my God was upon me, and I gathered leaders from Israel to go up with me. 1 These were the heads of their families and the register of those returnees from Babylonia who came up with me in the reign of King Artaxerxes: 2 From the descendants of Phinehas: Gershom. From the descendants of Ithamar: Daniel. From the descendants of David: Hattush. 3 From the descendants of Shecaniah, from the descendants of Parosh: Zechariah and with him one hundred and fifty registered males. 4 From the descendants of Pahath-Moab: Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah and with him two hundred males. 5 From the descendants of Zattu: Shecaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males. 6 From the descendants of Adin: Ebed son of Jehonathan, and with him fifty males. 7 From the descendants of Elam: Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males. 8 From the descendants of Shephatiah: Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him eighty males. 9 From the descendants of Joab: Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males. 10 From the descendants of Bani: Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him one hundred and sixty males. 11 From the descendants of Bebai: Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males. 12 From the descendants of Azgad: Jehohanan son of Haqqatan, and with him one hundred and ten males. 13 From the descendants of Adonikam, those who came last, these were their names: Eliphelet, Jeiel, Shemaiah, and with them sixty males. 14 From the descendants of Bigvai: Uthai son of Zabud, and with him seventy males. 15 I gathered them by the river that goes to Ahava and we camped there for three days. And I looked at the people and the priests, I found no one there from the sons of Levi. 16 And I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were family heads, and for Jehoiarib and Elnathan who were wise. 17 I sent them to Iddo, the head of the place called Casiphia, and I placed in their mouths what words to say to Iddo and his brothers the temple servants in Casiphia, to send to us ministers for the house of our God. 18 With the good hand of our God before us, they brought us a man of understanding from the sons of Mahli, son of Levi, son of Israel—Sherebiah and his sons and brothers, eighteen in total. 19 Also Hashabiah and with him Jeshaiah, the sons of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, twenty in total. 20 And from the temple servants, whom David and his officials had set up to serve the Levites, two hundred and twenty in total. All of them were registered by name. 21 I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava to humble ourselves before our God in order to seek from him a safe journey for us, our children, and our possessions. 22 For I was ashamed to ask the king for troops and horses to protect us from enemies on the way because we said to the king, “the hand of our God is favorable to all who seek him, but his strength and anger are against all who forsake them.” 23 So we fasted and sought our God for this and he responded to our prayer. 24 I set apart twelve of the official priests: Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them. 25 Then I weighed out to them silver and gold and the vessels, the offering of the house of our God that the king, his counselors, his commanders, and all of Israel who was present offered. 26 I weighed out into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, one hundred vessels of silver, one hundred talents of gold, 27 twenty gold bowls worth one thousand darics, and two vessels of good polished bronze as precious as gold. 28 And I said to them, “You are holy to Yahweh and the vessels are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh, God of your ancestors. 29 Guard and look after them until you weigh them before the chief priests, the Levites, and the heads of the families of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chamber of the house of Yahweh.” 30 So the priests and Levites took over the weighed silver, gold, and the vessels to bring to Jerusalem for the house of our God. 31 On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the river of Ahava to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushing on the way. 32 We came to Jerusalem and remained there three days. 33 On the fourth day, the silver, gold, and vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of priest Meremoth, the son of Uriah, and with him Eleazar son of Phinehas. With them were the Levites, Jehozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 34 The amount and weight of all the weighed items was recorded at that time. 35 The exiles that returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel; twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve goats as a sin offering. All was a burnt offering to Yahweh. 36 They delivered the customs of the king to the king’s satraps and to the governor of the province Beyond the River. And they supported the people of the house of God. ",Ezra 7-8,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ezra-7-8-20078/direct-download/tbd20080328.mp3
Ezra,"1 After finishing these things the officials approached me saying, “The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated from the people of the lands with their detestable things, and from the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites. 2 For they have taken from their daughters for themselves and their sons. So the holy seed has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands, and the hand of the officials and prefects were foremost in this sin. 3 When I heard this I tore my garment and my robe, and I pulled the hair out from my head and beard, and I sat appalled. 4 Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel because of the sin of the returned exiles were gathered around me and I sat appalled until the evening offering. 5 At the evening offering I got up from my mourning posture and, with my garment and robe torn, I fell down on my knees and I spread out my palms to Yahweh my God 6 and said, “My God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face to you, my God. For our sins have risen above our heads and our guilt has grown up to the heavens. 7 From the days of our ancestors until this day we have been in great guilt, and because of our sins we ourselves, our kings, and our priests have been handed into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to utter shame, as it is this day. 8 But now for a brief moment mercy has been shown by Yahweh our God, who left behind for us a remnant, and given us security in his holy place—for our God to brighten our eyes and to give us brief relief in our bondage. 9 For we are slaves and in our bondage our God did not forsake us, and he has extended to us loyal love in the presence of the kings of Persia, to give to us deliverance and to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judea and Jerusalem. 10 “And now our God what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments, 11 which you commanded by the hand of your servants the prophets saying, ‘The land that you are entering to possess is a land of impurity with the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their detestable things which they have filled from end to end with their uncleanness. 12 Therefore, do not give your daughters to their sons, and do not take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek their peace and prosperity so that forever you may be strong and eat the good of the land and may give it as an inheritance to your sons.’ 13 After all that has come upon us for our evil practices and for our great guilt—you, our God, have held back less than our guilt deserved and you have given us a remainder such as this. 14 Shall we again break your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who practice these detestable things? Would you not be angry with us until you destroy us with no remnant or remainder? 15 Yahweh, God of Israel, you are righteous, for we have been left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, for none can stand before you because of this.” ",Ezra 9,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/ezra-9-20079/direct-download/tbd20080331.mp3
Ezra,"1 While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a very great assembly of men, women, and children from Israel gathered to him. And the people wept bitterly. 2 Shecaniah son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, “We ourselves have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, and even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this. 3 So now let us make a covenant with our God to send away all of these women and their offspring, according to the advice of my lord and those who tremble at the commandment of our God. Let it be done according to the law. 4 Arise, for it is your task and we are with you. Be strong and do it.” 5 Then Ezra stood up and made the chief priests, Levites, and all of Israel swear to do according to what was said. So they swore this oath. 6 Ezra rose from before the house of God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. He did not eat food nor drink water because he was mourning over the sin of the exiles. 7 And they sent a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. 8 Anyone who did not come within three days, by decision of the officials and elders, all of his possessions would be devoted to God, and he himself would be excluded from the assembly of exiles. 9 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled in Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month. All the people sat in the public square of the house of God trembling because of this matter and from the rains. 10 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have broke faith and married foreign women, increasing the guilt of Israel. 11 Now make a confession to Yahweh the God of your ancestors and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign women.” 12 Then all the assembly answered with a great voice and said, “It is so. We must do according to your words. 13 But the people are many, and it is the time of rain; we are unable to stand outside. The task is not for one day or two, for we greatly rebelled in this matter. 14 Please let our leaders stand for the whole assembly, and let all that are in our cities who have married foreign women come at set times, and with them the elders of and judges of each city, until the fierce wrath of our God because of this matter is averted from us.” 15 Only Jehonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah stood against this, and the Levites Meshullam and Shabbethai supported them. 16 The returned exiles did so. Ezra the priest selected men, the heads of the families according to the house of their fathers, all of them by name. They sat down to examine the matter on the first day of the tenth month. 17 They finished investigating all the men who married foreign women by the first day of the first month. 18 There was found from the sons of the priests those who had married foreign women, from the sons of Jeshua son of Jehozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. 19 They pledged themselves to put away their wives, and their guilt offering was a ram of the flock for their guilt. 20 From the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah. 21 From the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah. 22 From the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Eleasah. 23 From the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer. 24 From the singers: Eliashib. From the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri. 25 And from Israel, the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malkijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malkijah, and Benaiah. 26 From the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah. 27 From the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza. 28 From the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai. 29 From the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth. 30 From the sons of Pahath-Moab: Adna, Kelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh. 31 From the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshiah, Malkijah, Shemaiah, Simeon, 32 Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah. 33 From the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei. 34 From the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel, 35 Benaiah, Bedeiah, Keluhi, 36 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 37 Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasu, 38 Bani, Binnui, Shimei, 39 Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, 40 Macnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, 41 Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, 42 Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph. 43 From the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Iddo, Joel, and Benaiah. 44 All of these had married foreign wives, and some from among the wives bore children.

1 Chronicles,"1 So all Israel was enrolled in genealogy. And behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel. And Judah was taken away to Babylon on account of their sin. 2 Now the first inhabitants who were settled on their property in their cities in Israel were the priests, the Levites, and the temple servants. 3 And some of the people of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh lived in Jerusalem: 4 Uthai the son of Ammihud, son of Omri, son of Imri, son of Bani, from the sons of Perez, the son of Judah. 5 And from the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn and his sons. 6 And from the sons of Zerah: Jeuel and their brethren, six hundred and ninety. 7 And from the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah; 8 Ibneah the son of Jeroham; Elah the son of Uzzi, son of Michri; Meshullam the son of Shephatiah, son of Reuel, son of Ibnijah; 9 and their brethren according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty-six. All these men were the heads of the families in the house of their fathers. 10 And from the priests: Jedaiah; Jehoiarib; Jakin; 11 Azariah son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son of Zadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, the commander of the house of God; 12 Adaiah son of Jeroham, son of Pashhur, son of Malkijah; Maasai the son of Adiel, son of Jahzerah, son of Meshullam, son of Meshillemith, son of Immer; 13 and their kinsmen, heads of the house of their fathers, one thousand seven hundred and sixty mighty men for the work of the service of the house of God. 14 And from the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, from the sons of Merari; 15 Bakbakkar; Heresh; Galal; Mattaniah the son of Mica, son of Zicri, son of Asaph; 16 Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun; and Berechiah the son of Asa, son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of Netophathite. 17 And the gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brethren (Shallum was the chief); 18 until then they were gatekeepers at the gate of the king on the east side toward the camps of the Levites. 19 And Shallum the son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his kinsmen of the house of his fathers, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, the guardians of the entrances to the tent, and their fathers were over the camp of Yahweh, guardians of the entrance. 20 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the leader over them in time past; Yahweh was with him. 21 Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the doorway to the tent of assembly. 22 All of them were chosen as gatekeepers at the entrances, two hundred and twelve. They were enrolled by genealogies in their villages. They were established by David and Samuel the seer on account of their faithfulness. 23 So they and their sons were over the gates of the house of Yahweh at the house of the tent as guards. 24 The gatekeepers were on four sides: east, west, north, and south. 25 And their brethren in their villages were to come every seven days by turn to be with these. 26 For the four mighty gatekeepers, they who were Levites, were entrusted and were over the chambers and over the storerooms of the house of God. 27 And they lodged all around the house of God, for upon them was a responsibility. And they had charge of opening the house of God every morning. 28 And some of them were over the utensils of the service, for they count them when they are brought in and they count them when they are brought out. 29 And some of them were appointed over the objects, over all the objects of the sanctuary, and over the wheat flour and the wine, the olive oil, the frankincense, and the spices. 30 And some of the sons of the priests mixed the fragrant ointment for the spices. 31 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite and was entrusted with the work of the pan breads. 32 And from the sons of the Kohathites, some of their kinsmen were over the showbread to prepare it every Sabbath. 33 Now these were the singers; the heads of the families of the Levites were in the chambers free from other service, for day and night they were over them on the service. 34 These were the heads of the families of the Levites according to their genealogies, leaders. These lived in Jerusalem. 35 And these lived in Gibeon: Jeiel the father of Gibeon. And the name of his wife was Maacah. 36 And his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, 37 Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. 38 And Mikloth fathered Shimeam. And they also lived nearby their brothers in Jerusalem with their brothers. 39 And Ner fathered Kish, and Kish fathered Saul, and Saul fathered Jonathan, Malchi-Shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal. 40 And the son of Jonathan was Meribaal. And Meribaal fathered Micah. 41 And the sons of Micah were Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz. 42 And Ahaz fathered Jarah, and Jarah fathered Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri. And Zimri fathered Moza, 43 and Moza fathered Binea; and Rephaiah was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. 44 And Azel had six sons, and these are their names: Azrikam, Bokeru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel. 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and every Israelite fled away from before the Philistines. And they fell slain upon Mount Gilboa. 2 And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua, the sons of Saul. 3 And the battle was heavy against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers. 4 And Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and deal harshly with me.” But his armor-bearer was not willing, because he was very afraid. Then Saul took the sword and fell upon it. 5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon the sword, and he died. 6 So Saul died. And his three sons and all his house died together. 7 And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. Then the Philistines came and dwelled in them. 8 And it happened that on the next day when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 9 And they stripped him and took his head and his weapons, and they sent them throughout the land of the Philistines to bring news to their idols and the nation. 10 And they put his weapons in the temple of their gods, and they fastened his skull to the temple of Dagon. 11 When all Jabesh-Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 12 every strong man arose and took the dead body of Saul and the dead bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days. 13 So Saul died on account of his sin which he had sinned against Yahweh concerning the command of Yahweh that he did not keep. He also consulted a medium to seek guidance. 14 But he did not seek Yahweh. So Yahweh put him to death and turned over the kingship to David, the son of Jesse.

1 Chronicles,"1 Then all Israel gathered to David in Hebron, saying, “Look—we are your flesh and bones. 2 For some time now, even when Saul was king, you were the one who led the army of Israel in battle. And Yahweh your God said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel and will be leader over my people Israel.’ ” 3 Then all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron in the presence of Yahweh. And they anointed David as king over Israel according to the word of Yahweh by the hand of Samuel. 4 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is Jebus). And the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there. 5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not enter here.” But David captured the stronghold of Zion; that is, the city of David. 6 Then David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first will be chief and commander.” And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first and became chief. 7 And David lived in the fortress. Therefore they called it the city of David. 8 And he built the city all around from the Millo and up to the circuit. And Joab restored the remainder of the city. 9 And David became greater and greater. And Yahweh of hosts was with him. 10 Now these are the chiefs of the mighty men who were for David, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel to make him king according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel. 11 And this is the numbering of the mighty warriors who were for David: Jashobeam son of Hachmoni was chief of the three. He himself raised his spear against three hundred whom he killed on one occasion. 12 And after him was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite. He was among the three mighty warriors. 13 He himself was with David at Pas-Dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for the battle. And there was a plot of the field filled with barley, and the people fled before the Philistines. 14 But they took their stand in the middle of the plot and defended it. And they killed the Philistines. And Yahweh saved them with a great victory. 15 And three of the thirty chiefs went down toward the rock to David at the cave of Adullam when the army of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 16 And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. 17 And David had a craving, and he said, “Who could give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!” 18 Then the three broke through into the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and brought it and came to David. But David would not drink it and poured it out before Yahweh. 19 And he said, “Far be it from me that I would do this before my God. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.” And he was not willing to drink it. These things the three mighty men did. 20 Now Abishai the brother of Joab was himself the head of the three. And he roused himself with his spear against three hundred whom he killed and made a name for himself among the three. 21 He was twice as renowned among the three and was their commander. But he did not attain to the three. 22 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a strong man from Kabzeel, one who did great deeds. He himself struck down two sons of Ariel of Moab. And he himself went down and struck down a lion within a pit on a snowy day. 23 And he himself struck down an Egyptian man, a large man five cubits tall. And in the hand of the Egyptian was a spear like a weaver’s beam. But he went down to him with a club and seized the spear from the hand of the Egyptian and killed him with his own spear. 24 These things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did and had a name among the three mighty warriors. 25 He himself was certainly distinguished among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David appointed him over his bodyguard. 26 Now the mighty warriors of the troops were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo from Bethlehem, 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, 29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, 31 Ittai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the people of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 32 Hurai of the valleys of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jehonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite, 35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 36 Hepher the Mekerathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naari the son of Ezbai, 38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, 39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the bearer of the weapons of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a leader of the Reubenites, and thirty with him, 43 Hanan the son of Maacah, Jehoshaphat the Mithnite, 44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, 45 Jediael the son of Shimri and Joha his brother the Tizite, 46 Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite, 47 Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite. 1 Now these are the ones who came to David at Ziklag while he was still shut up because of Saul, the son of Kish. And they were the mighty warriors helping with the war. 2 They were armed with the bow, able to shoot right-handed or left-handed, slinging stones or shooting arrows with the bow; they were kinsmen of Saul from Benjamin. 3 The leader was Ahiezer, then Jehoash, sons of Shemaah the Gibeonite; Jeiel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite; 4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty warrior among the thirty who was over the thirty; Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan; Jozabad the Gederathite; 5 Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Hariphite; 6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam the Korahites; 7 Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham from the Gedor. 8 And from the Gadites, valiant mighty warriors, soldiers fit for war, expert with shield and spear, defected to David at the fortress toward the wilderness. And they had faces like lions and were swift as gazelles upon the mountains. 9 Ezer the chief, Obadiah second, Eliab third, 10 Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth, 11 Attai sixth, Eliel seventh, 12 Jehonan eighth, Elzabad ninth, 13 Jeremiah tenth, Macbannai eleventh. 14 These were the sons of Gad, leaders of the army. The smallest one was as a hundred, and the greatest as a thousand. 15 These were they who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was filled over all its banks. And they put to flight all who were in the valley to the east and to the west. 16 And some of the sons of Benjamin and from Judah came to the fortress, to David. 17 And David went out to meet them and answered and said to them, “If you come in peace to me, to help me, my heart will be joined with you, but if you come to betray me to my adversaries, although there is no wrong on my hands, may the God of our fathers see and pass judgment.” 18 Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the thirty who said: “We are yours, O David! And we are with you, O son of Jesse! Peace! Peace to you, and peace to those who help you, for your God helps you.” So David appointed them as heads of the troops. 19 And some Manassites deserted to David when he came with the Philistines to the battle against Saul, but he did not help them, for the rulers of the Philistines sent him away upon counsel, saying, “He will desert to his master Saul at the cost of our heads.” 20 When he went to Ziklag some Manassites deserted to him: Adnah, Jehozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, heads of the thousands that were for Manasseh. 21 And they themselves helped David against the troops, for all of them were mighty men of strength and were commanders in the army. 22 Day in and day out they came to David to help him until there was a great army, like the army of God. 23 And these are the numbers of the chiefs of those prepared for the army who came to David at Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him according to the word of Yahweh. 24 The sons of Judah bearing shield and spear: six thousand eight hundred armed troops. 25 From the men of Simeon, mighty warriors of strength for war: seven thousand one hundred. 26 From the Levites: four thousand six hundred. 27 Jehoiada the chief officer of the house of Aaron, and with him, three thousand seven hundred. 28 And Zadok, a young man, a mighty warrior of strength, and the house of his father: twenty-two commanders. 29 From the men of Benjamin, kinsmen of Saul, three thousand, and even still the majority of them remained loyal to the house of Saul. 30 And from the men of Ephraim: twenty thousand eight hundred mighty warriors of strength, famous men in the house of their fathers. 31 And from the half-tribe of Manasseh: eighteen thousand who were designated by name to come to make David king. 32 And from the men of Issachar: men who were skilled in understanding the times to know what Israel should do. Their chiefs were two hundred, and all their kinsmen were under their command. 33 From Zebulun, those who went out armed, equipped for battle with all the weapons of war: fifty thousand to help David with singleness of purpose. 34 From Naphtali: one thousand commanders; and those with them with shield and spear: thirty-seven thousand. 35 From the Danites, those equipped for battle: twenty-eight thousand six hundred. 36 And from Asher, those who went out armed and prepared for battle: forty thousand. 37 And from beyond the Jordan, from the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all their weapons of war for battle: one hundred and twenty thousand. 38 All these were men of war arrayed in battle line with a whole heart. They came to Hebron to make David king over all Israel. Likewise, all the rest of Israel had one heart to make David king. 39 And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their kinsmen were prepared for them. 40 And also their relatives, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought food on donkeys, on camels, on mules, and on oxen—provisions of flour, cakes of figs, raisin cakes, wine and oil, cattle and sheep in abundance, for there was great joy in Israel.

1 Chronicles,"1 And David consulted with the commanders of thousands and hundreds, with every leader. 2 And David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you and before Yahweh our God, let us send word abroad to our brothers who remain in all the land of Israel and to the priests and Levites with them in the cities with their pasturelands that they might be gathered to us. 3 Then let us bring around the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it in the days of Saul.” 4 And all the assembly agreed to do so, for the word was pleasing in the eyes of all the people. 5 And David summoned all Israel from Shihor of Egypt up to Lebo-Hamath to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-Jearim. 6 And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, Kiriath-Jearim of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of Yahweh God who is enthroned between the cherubim, which is called the name. 7 And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio were driving the cart. 8 Now David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their strength, and with songs, lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. 9 And when they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzza reached out his hand to hold the ark because the cattle had stumbled. 10 And Yahweh was angry with Uzza, and he struck him down because he reached his hand upon the ark. And he died there before God. 11 And David was angry because Yahweh had broken out in wrath against Uzza. And that place is called Perez Uzza unto this day. 12 And David feared God on that day, saying, “How can I bring the ark of God home to me?” 13 So David did not move the ark to himself into the city of David but diverted it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. 14 And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And Yahweh blessed the household of Obed-Edom and all that he had. 1 And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent messengers to David and cedar trees, masons, and carpenters to build a house for him. 2 And David knew that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel. 3 And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and daughters. 4 Now these are the names of the children who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet. 8 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed as king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard and went out from before them. 9 Now the Philistines came and carried out a raid in the Valley of Rephaim. 10 Then David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you put them into my hand?” And Yahweh said to him, “Go up. I will put them into your hand.” 11 And he went up to Baal-Perazim, and David struck them there. And David said, “God has burst out against my enemies by my hand like waters burst out.” Therefore they will call the name of this place Baal-Perazim. 12 And they abandoned their gods there. And David commanded, and they were burnt with fire. 13 Then the Philistines carried out another raid in the valley. 14 Then David inquired again of God. And God said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Go around from before them and come against them the opposite way of the balsam trees. 15 And it shall be that when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out into battle, for God goes out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.” 16 And David did as God commanded him, and they struck the camp of the Philistines from Gibeon to Gezer. 17 And the fame of David went out through all the lands. And Yahweh put the fear of him upon all the nations. 1 And David built houses for himself in the city of David, and he established a place for the ark of God. And he pitched a tent for it. 2 Then David ordered that none except the Levites should carry the ark of God, for Yahweh had chosen them to carry the ark of Yahweh and to serve him forever.

1 Chronicles,"1 And David built houses for himself in the city of David, and he established a place for the ark of God. And he pitched a tent for it. 2 Then David ordered that none except the Levites should carry the ark of God, for Yahweh had chosen them to carry the ark of Yahweh and to serve him forever. 3 And David gathered all Israel to Jerusalem to bring up the ark of Yahweh to its place that he had established for it. 4 And David gathered the sons of Aaron and the Levites. 5 Of the sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief and one hundred and twenty of his brothers. 6 Of the sons of Merari: Asaiah the chief and two hundred and twenty of his brothers. 7 Of the sons of Gershom: Joel the chief and one hundred and thirty of his brothers. 8 Of the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the chief and two hundred of his brothers. 9 Of the sons of Hebron: Eliel the chief and eighty of his brothers. 10 Of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief and one hundred and twelve of his brothers. 11 Then David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. 12 And he said to them, “You are the heads of the families for the Levites. Sanctify yourselves and your brothers and bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, to the place I have established for it. 13 Because the first time you did not, and Yahweh our God burst out against us, for we did not care for it according to the law.” 14 Then the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel. 15 And the sons of the Levites carried the ark of God according to what Moses commanded, according to the word of Yahweh, on their shoulders with the carrying poles upon them. 16 Then David ordered the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of song, musical instruments, stringed instruments, and cymbals, raising their voices for joy. 17 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel, and from his brothers, Asaph the son of Berekiah, and from the sons of Merari, their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 18 and with them their brothers of the second rank, Zechariah the son, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-Edom and Jeiel. 19 Now the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound bronze cymbals; 20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play on harps according to Alamoth; 21 and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to play lyres, directing according to the Sheminith. 22 And Kenaniah, chief of the Levites in singing, was to be an instructor in singing because he understood. 23 And Berekiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark. 24 And Shebaniah, Jehoshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Elizezer the priests sounded the trumpets before the ark of God. And Obed-Edom and Jehiah were gatekeepers for the ark. 25 And it happened that David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh from the house of Obed-Edom with joy. 26 And it happened that when God helped the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. 27 Now David was clothed with a robe of fine linen; so also all the Levites who were carrying the ark, the singers, and Kenaniah the chief of the singing. And David wore a linen ephod. 28 And all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with shouting, with the sound of a shofar, and with trumpets and cymbals, making loud music with musical instruments and stringed instruments. 29 And when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the city of David, then Michal the daughter of Saul looked down from the window and saw the king, David, leaping and dancing. And she despised him in her heart. 1 And they brought the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And they offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before God. 2 And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh. 3 And he distributed to every man of Israel, both men and women, to each person a loaf of bread, a cake of dates, and a cake of raisins. 4 Then he appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of Yahweh, to invoke, thank, and praise Yahweh the God of Israel. 5 Asaph was chief, and his second was Zechariah; Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel were on harps and lyres. And Asaph played on the cymbals. 6 And Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests blew on the trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. 7 Then on that day David first appointed to give thanks to Yahweh by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.

1 Chronicles,"8 Give thanks to Yahweh; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the nations! 9 Sing to him; sing praises to him; tell of all his wondrous works! 10 Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those seeking Yahweh rejoice! 11 Seek Yahweh and his strength; seek his face continually! 12 Remember his wonderful works that he has done, his wonders and the judgments of his mouth, 13 O offspring of Israel, his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones! 14 He is Yahweh our God; his judgments are in all the earth. 15 Remember his covenant forever, the word he commanded for a thousand generations, 16 that he made with Abraham, his sworn oath to Isaac. 17 And he confirmed it to Jacob as a statute, an everlasting covenant to Israel, 18 saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan, the portion of your inheritance.” 19 When you were few in number, very few, and sojourners in it, 20 when they wandered from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people, 21 he did not allow anyone to oppress them, and he rebuked kings on their account, 22 saying, “You must not touch my anointed nor do harm to my prophets!” 23 Sing to Yahweh, all the earth! Proclaim his salvation from day to day! 24 Proclaim his glory among the nations, his wondrous works among all the peoples! 25 For Yahweh is great and greatly praised, and he is feared among all gods. 26 For all the gods of the nations are idols, but Yahweh made the heavens. 27 Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and joy are in his place. 28 Ascribe to Yahweh, O clans of the nations, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength! 29 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory of his name! Lift up an offering and come before him! Bow down to Yahweh in the splendor of holiness! 30 Tremble before him, all the earth; surely the world is established; it shall not be shaken. 31 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad, and let them tell the peoples, “Yahweh reigns!” 32 Let the sea roar and its fullness; let the field rejoice and all that is in it. 33 Then the trees of the forest shall sing for joy before Yahweh, for he comes to judge the earth. 34 Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good; his loyal love is everlasting. 35 Then say, “Save us, O God of our salvation; gather us and rescue us from the nations that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise. 36 Blessed be Yahweh the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting!” Then all the people said, “Amen!” and praised Yahweh. 37 So he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to minister before the ark regularly as each day required, 38 and he left Obed-Edom with his sixty-eight brothers. And Obed-Edom, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah were gatekeepers. 39 And he left Zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle of Yahweh at the high place which was at Gibeon 40 to offer burnt offerings regularly to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering, morning and evening, according to all that was written in the law of Yahweh that he commanded concerning Israel. 41 And with them were Heman and Jeduthun and the remainder of those chosen, who were designated by name to give thanks to Yahweh, for his loyal love is everlasting. 42 And Heman and Jeduthun with them had trumpets and cymbals for making music, along with instruments for the song of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were at the gate. 43 Then all the people went each to his house, and David turned to bless his household. 1 And as David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Look, I live in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is under tent curtains.” 2 And Nathan said to David, “Whatever is in your heart, do, for God is with you.” 3 And it happened that same night the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 4 “Go and say to David my servant, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “You are not to build a house for me to live in, 5 for I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought out Israel unto this day. I have been from tent to tent and from tabernacle to tabernacle. 6 In every place I have moved about in all Israel, did I say one word with any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built for me a house of cedar?’ ” ’ 7 So now, thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be leader over my people Israel, 8 and I have been with you wherever you went and have cut down all your enemies from before you and will make a name for you, like the name of the great ones on the earth. 9 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place and be in anguish no longer. And wicked men will no longer wear them down as before, 10 from the day that I commanded judges over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies, and I declare to you that Yahweh will build for you a house. 11 And it shall be that when your days are fulfilled to go and sleep with your ancestors, then I will raise up your seed after you, who will be one of your sons, and I will establish his kingdom. 12 He himself will build for me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. 13 I myself will be a father to him, and he himself will be a son to me. And I will not remove my steadfast love from him as I took it away from whoever was before you. 14 And I will establish him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.” ’ ” 15 According to all these words and according to all this revelation, thus did Nathan speak to David. 16 Then King David went and sat before Yahweh and said, “Who am I, O Yahweh God, and what is my house that you have brought me thus far? 17 And this was a small matter in your eyes, O God. And you have spoken concerning the house of your servant for a long time and have shown me future generations to come, O Yahweh God. 18 What more can David do to you for honoring your servant? Now you know your servant. 19 O Yahweh, for the sake of your servant and according to your heart you have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things. 20 O Yahweh, there is none like you, and there is no God except you, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 21 And who is like your people Israel, the one nation upon earth whom God went to redeem for himself as a people, to establish for you a reputation for great and awesome things, to drive out nations from before your people whom you redeemed from Egypt? 22 And you made your people Israel an everlasting nation for yourself. And you, O Yahweh, became their God. 23 So now, O Yahweh, let the word that you spoke to your servant and to his house be established forever, that you might do what you have spoken. 24 And let your name be established and be magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel’s God, and may the house of David your servant be established before you.’ 25 For you, my God, have informed your servant that you will build a house for him. Therefore, your servant has found courage to pray before you. 26 So now, O Yahweh, you yourself are God, and you have spoken to your servant this good thing. 27 And now may you begin to bless the house of your servant to continue forever before you, for you, O Yahweh, have blessed. And it will be blessed forever.” ",1 Chronicles 16:8-17:27,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-chronicles-168-1727-20026/direct-download/tbd20080116.mp3
1 Chronicles,"1 And it happened that after David struck the Philistines and subdued them, he captured Gath and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines. 2 And he struck Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David, bearing tribute. 3 And David struck Hadadezer, king of Zobah-Hamath, as he went to set up his monument at the Euphrates River. 4 And David captured from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. And David hamstrung all the chariot horses but left one hundred of them to remain for chariots. 5 And when the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah-Hamath, David struck down twenty-two thousand men of Aram. 6 Then David set up garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to David, bearing tribute. And Yahweh delivered David wherever he went. 7 And David took small round shields of gold that were upon the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 8 And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David captured very much bronze. Solomon made the bronze sea with it along with the columns and objects of bronze. 9 And when Tou the king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadadezer the king of Zobah, 10 he sent Hadoram his son to King David to ask him for peace and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, for Tou had been at war with Hadadezer. And he brought with him all the objects of gold, silver, and bronze. 11 King David dedicated these also to Yahweh, along with the silver and gold that he had taken from all the nations, from Edom, Moab, the sons of Ammon, the Philistines, and Amalek. 12 And Abishai son of Zeruiah defeated eighteen thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt. 13 And he put garrisons in Edom, and all Edom became servants to David. And Yahweh delivered David wherever he went. 14 So David reigned over all Israel, and he administered justice and righteousness to all his people. 15 And Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder. 16 And Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were priests, and Shavsha was secretary. 17 And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites. And the sons of David were chief officials under the hand of the king. 1 And it happened that after this Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his place. 2 And David said, “I will deal kindly with Hanun the son of Nahash because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And the servants of David came to the land of the Ammonites, to Hanun, to comfort him. 3 But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Do you think because David sent comforters to you that David honors your father? Is it not for the purpose of exploring so as to overthrow and spy out the land that his servants have come to you?” 4 So Hanun took the servants of David and shaved them and cut off their garments at the middle, up to the buttocks, and sent them away. 5 And they went and told David concerning the men, and he inquired of them, for the men were very disgraced. And the king said, “Dwell in Jericho until your beards grow out; then return.” 6 And when the Ammonites saw that they made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent one thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves horses and chariots from Aram-Naharaim, Aram-Maacah, and Zobah. 7 And they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah and his people, and they came and encamped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were gathered from their cities and came to the battle. 8 And when David heard, he sent Joab and the entire army of mighty warriors. 9 And the Ammonites went out and took up positions for battle at the entrance of the city. And the kings who had come were alone in the field. 10 When Joab saw that there was a battle line against him at the front and the back, he chose from among the chosen men in Israel and arranged them to meet Aram. 11 And the remainder of the people he put in the hand of Abishai his brother, and they were arranged to meet the Ammonites. 12 And he said, “If Aram is too strong for me, then you must be a help to me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you. 13 Be strong! Let us strengthen ourselves on behalf of our people and on behalf of the cities of our God. And may Yahweh do what is good in his eyes.” 14 And Joab and the people who were with him drew near before Aram for battle, and they fled before him. 15 And when the Ammonites saw that Aram had fled, they also fled before Abishai his brother, and they came to the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. 16 And when Aram saw that they were defeated before Israel, they sent messengers and brought out Aram, who was from beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer before them. 17 And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan. And he came to them and was arrayed against them. Then David was arrayed to meet Aram in battle, and they fought with him. 18 And Aram fled before Israel. And David killed from Aram the men of seven thousand chariots and forty thousand foot soldiers, and he put to death Shophach the commander of the army. 19 And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David and became servants to him. So Aram was no longer willing to help the Ammonites.

1 Chronicles,"1 And it happened that in the spring time of year, the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led the troops of the army and destroyed the land of the Ammonites. And he came and besieged Rabbah, but David remained in Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and destroyed it. 2 And David took the crown of their king from his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold. And in it was a precious stone. Then it was placed upon the head of David. And he brought out the booty of the city, a very large amount. 3 And the people who were in it he brought out, and he set them to work with saws and iron implements and axes. Thus David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David returned to Jerusalem, and all the nation with him. 4 And after this there arose a war in Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim. And they were subdued. 5 And again there was war with the Philistines. And Elhanan son of Jair struck down Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 6 And again there was war in Gath. And there was a very tall man there, and he had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all. He himself was also a descendant of the Rephaim. 7 And he taunted Israel, but Jehonathan son of Shimea, brother of David, struck him down. 8 These were born to the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. 1 Then Satan stood against Israel and urged David to count Israel. 2 So David said to Joab and to the commanders of the nation, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba to Dan and bring a report to me that I might know their number.” 3 But Joab said, “May Yahweh add to the people a hundred times what they are! Are they not, O my lord the king, all of them the king’s servants? Why does my lord seek this? Why would he bring guilt to Israel?” 4 But the word of the king prevailed over Joab. Then he went about through all Israel and came to Jerusalem. 5 And Joab gave the number of the enrollment of the people to David. And it happened that all Israel was one million one hundred thousand men drawing a sword, and in Judah were four hundred and seventy thousand men drawing a sword. 6 But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the word of the king was repulsive to Joab. 7 But this word was displeasing in the eyes of God, and he struck Israel. 8 Then David said to God, “I have sinned severely in that I have done this thing. But now, please forgive the sin of your servant, for I have been very foolish.” 9 Then Yahweh spoke to Gad the seer of David, saying, 10 “Go, you must speak to David, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Three choices I offer to you. Choose one of them for yourself that I will do to you.” ’ ” 11 So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Choose for yourself: 12 whether three years of famine or three months of devastation by your enemies while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or three days of the sword of Yahweh, with disease in the land and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the territory in Israel.’ So now, see what word I should return to my sender.” 13 Then David said to Gad, “I am very troubled. Let me fall into the hand of Yahweh, for his compassion is very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of a man.” ",1 Chronicles 20:1-21:13,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-chronicles-201-2113-20028/direct-download/tbd20080118.mp3
1 Chronicles,"14 So Yahweh sent a pestilence through Israel, and seventy thousand men from Israel fell. 15 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, and as he was about to destroy it, Yahweh saw and was grieved on account of the calamity. Then he said to the angel, the destroyer, “It is enough; slacken your hand.” And the angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 16 And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and heaven, with his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. 17 Then David said to God, “Was it not I who gave a command to count the people? Now I am he who has sinned, and I have certainly done wickedness, but these sheep, what have they done? O Yahweh, my God, please let your hand be against me and against the house of my father, but against your people, let there be no plague.” 18 Now the angel of Yahweh had spoken to Gad to say to David that David should go up to erect an altar for Yahweh on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 19 So David went up at the word of Gad that he had spoken in the name of Yahweh. 20 Now Ornan was threshing wheat, and Ornan turned and saw the angel, and his four sons with him hid themselves. 21 Then David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw David. And he went out from the threshing floor, and they bowed down to David, faces to the ground. 22 Then David said to Ornan, “Please give me the place, the threshing floor, that I might build an altar on it to Yahweh; at full price please give it to me, that the plague against the people might be stopped.” 23 And Ornan said to David, “Take it to yourself; let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. See, I give the cattle for the burnt offerings and threshing sledges for the wood and wheat for the grain offering—I give it all.” 24 But King David said to Ornan, “No, for I will certainly buy it at full value; indeed, I will not take what is yours for Yahweh and offer burnt offerings for nothing.” 25 So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place. 26 Then David built an altar there to Yahweh, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and he called to Yahweh. And he answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering. 27 Then Yahweh commanded the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath. 28 At that time, when David saw that Yahweh answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there. 29 Now the tabernacle of Yahweh that Moses had made in the desert and the altar of burnt offering were at that time at the high place of Gibeon. 30 But David was not able to go before it to seek God, for he was afraid on account of the sword of the angel of Yahweh. 1 Then David said, “This will be the house of Yahweh God, and this altar of burnt offering for Israel.” 2 And David commanded to assemble the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel and appointed stone craftsmen to cut dressed stones to build the house of God. 3 And David provided much iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for the seams, and abundant copper that could not be weighed, 4 and cedar timbers without number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought abundant cedars to David. 5 Then David said, “Solomon my son is a boy and inexperienced, and the house built for Yahweh must be exceedingly great in fame and splendor throughout every land. I will make preparations for him.” So David provided abundant materials before he died. 6 Then he called to Solomon his son and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel. 7 And David said to Solomon his son, “I myself had in my heart to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, 8 but it happened that the word of Yahweh came over me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and have made much war; you shall not build a house for my name because you have shed much blood upon the ground before me. 9 Behold, a son shall be born to you; he himself will be a man of rest, and I will give rest to him from all his enemies all around, for his name will be Solomon, and peace and quietness I will give to Israel in his days.

1 Chronicles,"10 He himself will build a house for my name, and he himself will be to me a son, and I will be to him as a father, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ 11 Now, my son, Yahweh will be with you, that you may succeed and build the house of Yahweh your God as he has spoken concerning you. 12 Only may Yahweh give to you understanding and insight that he might give you charge over Israel and the keeping of the law of Yahweh your God. 13 Then you will prosper if you take care to do the statutes and judgments which Yahweh commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and be courageous; fear not and do not be dismayed. 14 Now see, with great effort I have made provision for the house of Yahweh: 100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron that cannot be weighed, for there is an abundance. Also timber and stone I have provided, but to these you should add. 15 And with you there is an abundance of craftsmen: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and everyone skilled in every kind of craftsmanship 16 with gold, silver, bronze, and iron without number. Arise and work! Yahweh will be with you!” 17 And David commanded all the commanders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, 18 “Is not Yahweh your God with you? And has he not given you rest all around? For he has put in my hand the inhabitants of the land, and the land is subdued before Yahweh and before his people. 19 Now set your heart and mind to seek Yahweh your God, and arise and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, that the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and the holy vessels of God might be brought into the house built for the name of Yahweh. 1 Now David was old and full of days. And he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 2 And he assembled all the commanders of Israel and the priests and the Levites. 3 And the Levites from thirty years old and above were counted, and their number according to their head count for the men was thirty-eight thousand. 4 Of these, David said, “Twenty-four thousand are to direct the work of the house of Yahweh, along with six thousand judges and officials, 5 four thousand gatekeepers, and four thousand offering praise to Yahweh with the instruments that I have made for praise.” 6 And David organized them in divisions according to the sons of Levi: to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 7 For the Gershonites were Ladan and Shimei. 8 The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief and Zetham and Joel, three. 9 The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the families of Ladan. 10 And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah; these four were the sons of Shimei. 11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons. They were enrolled as one for the house of a father. 12 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 13 The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was set apart to consecrate the most holy things. He and his sons were to burn offerings forever before Yahweh to serve him and to bless in his name forever. 14 But Moses the man of God and his sons were reckoned among the tribe of Levi. 15 The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. 16 The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. 17 And the sons of Eliezer were Rehabiah, the head. And Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 18 The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief. 19 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 20 The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief and Isshiah the second. 21 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. 22 And Eleazar died, and he did not have sons, but only daughters. And the sons of Kish, their relatives, married them. 23 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three. 24 These were the sons of Levi according to the house of their fathers, the heads of the families, according to their enrollment, by the number of the names, according to their head count, who were to do the work of the service of the house of Yahweh, from twenty years old and above. 25 For David said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people, and he dwells in Jerusalem forever. 26 And also, the Levites do not need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.” 27 For by the last words of David, they are the number of the sons of Levi, from twenty years old and above. 28 For their station was to assist the sons of Aaron with the service of the house of Yahweh, over the courtyards, over the chambers, and over the cleansing of all the sanctified objects, and with the work of the service of the house of God, 29 and with the rows of bread, the flour, the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baked offering, the offering mixed with oil, and for all the amounts and measurements. 30 And they were to stand every morning, thanking and praising Yahweh, and likewise in the evening, 31 and for every burnt offering offered to Yahweh, on Sabbaths, on new moon festivals, and at the appointed feasts, according to the customary number required of them, regularly before Yahweh. 32 And they shall keep the responsibility of the tent of assembly, the responsibility of the sanctified objects, and the responsibility of the sons of Aaron, their brothers, to serve the house of Yahweh.

1 Chronicles,"1 And as for the sons of Aaron, these were their divisions. The sons of Aaron were Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 2 And Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and they had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. 3 And David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their appointments for their service. 4 And more sons of Eleazar were found as heads of the men than the sons of Ithamar, so they divided them to the sons of Eleazar to be sixteen heads over the house of the fathers, and to the sons of Ithamar over the house of the fathers were eight heads. 5 They divided them by lot all alike, for they were commanders of the sanctuary and commanders of God from among the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar. 6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel, the scribe, from the Levites, recorded them before the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the families of the priests and Levites, one father’s house drawn by lot for Eleazar and one drawn by lot for Ithamar. 7 And the first lot went out to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 9 the fifth to Malkijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shekaniah, 12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, 14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, 15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Ha-Pizzez, 16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Ezekiel, 17 the twenty-first to Jakin, the twenty-second to Gamul, 18 the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. 19 These were their appointments for their service to come into the house of Yahweh according to their custom by the hand of Aaron their father, as Yahweh the God of Israel had commanded him. 20 And as for the remainder of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. 21 Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief. 22 Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. 23 Of the sons of Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. 24 The sons of Uzziel, Micah; the sons of Micah, Shamur. 25 The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. 26 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah, his son. 27 The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, his son, Shoham, Zakkur, and Ibri. 28 Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. 29 Of Kish: the sons of Kish, Jerahmeel. 30 And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to the house of their fathers. 31 And lots were also cast for these, just as their brothers, the sons of Aaron, before David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the families for the priests and for the Levites the fathers, on the principle of the chief and younger brother alike. 1 And David and the commanders of the army set apart for the service the sons of Asaph, of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who prophesied with stringed instruments, with harps, and with cymbals. And their inventory of the men of the work and for their duty was: 2 for the sons of Asaph: Zakkur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, sons of Asaph, under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied under the hands of the king. 3 Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Heshabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with the stringed instrument with thanksgiving and praise to Yahweh. 4 Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth. 5 All these were sons to Heman, the seer of the king, according to the words of God to raise a horn. And God had given to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. 6 All these were under the direction of their father in the music of the house of Yahweh, with cymbals, harps, and stringed instruments for the service of the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the direction of the king. 7 And their number, along with their brothers, trained singers, all the skilled people for Yahweh, were two hundred and eighty-eight. 8 And they cast lots for responsibilities on the principle of small and great alike, teacher with student. 9 And the first lot for Asaph went out to Joseph; the second to Gedaliahu; he and his brothers and his twelve sons. 10 The third, Zakkur, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 11 the fourth to Izri, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 12 the fifth, Nethaniah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 13 the sixth, Bukkiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 14 the seventh, Jesarelah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 15 the eighth, Jeshaiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 16 the ninth, Mattaniah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 17 the tenth, Shimei, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 18 eleventh, Azarel, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 19 the twelfth to Hashabiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 20 to the thirteenth, Shubael, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 21 to the fourteenth, Mattithiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 22 to the fifteenth, to Jeremoth, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 23 to the sixteenth, to Hananiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 24 to the seventeenth, to Joshbekashah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 25 to the eighteenth, to Hanani, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 26 to the nineteenth, to Mallothi, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 27 to the twentieth, to Eliathah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 28 to the twenty-first, to Hothir, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 29 to the twenty-second, to Giddalti, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 30 to the twenty-third, to Mahazioth, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 31 to the twenty-fourth, to Romamti-ezer, his sons and his brothers, twelve. 1 As for the working groups of the gatekeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, from the sons of Asaph. 2 And Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth, 3 Elam the fifth, Jehohana the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh. 4 And Obed-Edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sachar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth, 5 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed him. 6 And to Shemaiah his son were sons born who were rulers in the house of their father, for they were mighty warriors of ability. 7 The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose brothers were sons of ability, Elihu and Semakiah. 8 All these from the sons of Obed-Edom, they and their sons, and their brothers were men of ability with strength for service; sixty-two of Obed-Edom. 9 And Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, sons of ability, eighteen. 10 And Hosah, from the sons of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief (though he was not firstborn, his father appointed him as chief), 11 Hilkiah the second, Tabaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen. 12 These working groups of gatekeepers, corresponding to the chief men, had responsibilities like their brothers to serve in the house of Yahweh. 13 And they cast lots, small and great alike, by their fathers’ houses, for their gates. 14 And the lot fell to the east to Shelemiah. As for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots. And his lot came out for the north. 15 To Obed-Edom went out the south, and to his sons, the storehouses. 16 For Shuppim and Hosah it went out for the west, at the gate of Shalleketh, on the road that goes up, guard for guard. 17 To the east, six Levites; to the north, four daily; to the south, four daily; and at the storerooms, two by two. 18 For the court to the west, four at the road, two at the court. 19 These were the working groups of the gatekeepers among the sons of the Korahites and among the sons of Merari. 20 And of the Levites: Ahijah was over the treasuries of the house of God and over the treasuries of the sanctified objects. 21 The sons of Ladan: the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the families belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli. 22 The sons of Jehieli, Zetham and Joel his brother, were over the treasuries of the house of Yahweh. 23 Of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Ozzielites: 24 Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was commander over the treasuries. 25 And his brothers: from Eliezer were Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zikri his son, and Shelomoth his son. 26 That Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasuries of the sanctified objects that King David and the heads of the families to the commanders of thousands and hundreds and the commanders of the army had dedicated. 27 From the battles and from the spoil they had dedicated these things to strengthen the house of Yahweh. 28 And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah had dedicated—all the dedicated gifts were under the hand of Shelomith and his brothers. 29 For the Izharites: Kenaniah and his sons were appointed to the duties outside of Israel as officials and as judges. 30 For the Hebronites: Hashabiah and his brothers, one thousand seven hundred men of ability, were over the administration of Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all the work of Yahweh and for the service of the king. 31 For the Hebronites: Jeriah the chief of the Hebronites for the genealogy for the families. (In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were examined, and there was found among them mighty warriors of strength at Jazer in Gilead.) 32 And his brothers, sons of ability, were two thousand seven hundred heads of the families, and King David appointed them over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, for every matter of God and matter of the king. 1 And as for the number of the Israelites, the heads of families, the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and their officials who serve the king in all matters of the working groups that came and went, month by month, throughout all the months of the year, each working group: twenty-four thousand. 2 Over the first working group for the first month: Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel. And he was over his working group of twenty-four thousand. 3 From the sons of Perez who was the chief of all the commanders of the armies for the first month. 4 And over the working groups of the second month: Dodai the Ahohite and his working group, and Mikloth the commander.

For Benjamin: Jaasiel son of Abner. 22 For Dan: Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the commanders of the tribes of Israel. 23 And David did not take a census of those twenty years old or under because Yahweh promised to make Israel more numerous than the stars of heaven. 24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to count, but he did not finish. But wrath came upon Israel concerning this, and the number was not included in the chronicles of King David. 25 And over the treasury rooms of the king was Azmaveth the son of Adiel. And over the treasuries in the country, in the cities, in the unwalled villages, and in the towers was Jonathan the son of Uzziah. 26 And over those who did the work in the field to till the soil was Ezri the son of Kelub. 27 And over the vineyards was Shemei the Ramathite.

And Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the sons of the king. 33 And Ahithophel was an adviser to the king, and Hushai the Arkite was a friend of the king. 34 And after Ahithophel came Jehoiada, the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. And Joab was the commander of the king’s army. 1 Then David assembled all the commanders of Israel, the commanders of the tribes and the commanders of working groups who served the king, and the commanders of thousands, the commanders of hundreds, and the commanders over all the property of the king and his sons, with the court officials and mighty warriors, and all the mighty warriors of ability, at Jerusalem. 2 And King David rose to his feet and said, “Listen to me, my brothers and my people. I myself wanted to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and the footstool of our God, and I prepared to build. 3 But God said to me, ‘You may not build a house for my name because you are a man of war, and you have shed blood.’ 4 But Yahweh the God of Israel chose me from all of the house of my father to be king over Israel forever, for he chose Judah as leader, and in the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to reign over all Israel. 5 And from all my sons—for Yahweh has given many sons to me—he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of Yahweh over Israel. 6 And he said to me, ‘Solomon your son, he himself shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him as a son to myself, and I myself will be as a father to him, 7 and I will establish his kingdom forever if he firmly performs my commandments and my judgments as he has to this day.’ 8 So now in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek all the commandments of Yahweh your God so that you may take possession of this good land and bestow it as an inheritance to your children after you forever.” 9 “And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and a willing mind, for Yahweh searches all hearts and understands every plan and all thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you forever. 10 Look now, for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong and do it!” 11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the plan of the vestibule and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, its inner chambers, and of the house of the lid of the ark, ",1 Chronicles 24:1-28:11,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-chronicles-241-2811-20031/direct-download/tbd20080123.mp3
1 Chronicles,"11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the plan of the vestibule and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, its inner chambers, and of the house of the lid of the ark, 12 and the plan of all that he had in mind for the courtyards of the house of Yahweh and for all the surrounding storage rooms, the treasuries of the house of God, and the treasuries for sanctified objects, 13 and for the working groups of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh, and for all the vessels for the service of the house of Yahweh, 14 and for the gold, according to the weight of the gold for all the vessels of the service, and the service of all the vessels of silver according to the weight of all the vessels for every kind of service. 15 And the weight of the golden lampstands and the golden lamps, the weight of each lampstand and each lamp, and the silver according to the weight of a lampstand and its lamp, according to the use of each lampstand, 16 and the weight of gold for the tables of the arranged bread, each table, and silver for the tables of silver, 17 and pure gold for the three-pronged meat forks, and the bowls and the pitchers, and for the golden bowls, by weight for each bowl, and for the silver bowls, by weight for each bowl, 18 and for the altar of incense made of refined gold, by weight, and gold for the plan for the chariot—the cherubim with outspread and covering wings over the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. 19 “All this I give you in writing; from the hand of Yahweh he instructed me about all the workings of this plan.” 20 Then David said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do this! Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed, for Yahweh God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you and will not forsake you until all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh is finished. 21 And behold, the working groups of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work for all those willing with the skill for every service, and the commanders and all the people for all your commands.” 1 Then David the king said to all the assembly, “God has chosen Solomon my son alone, a young man and inexperienced, and the work is great, for the citadel is not for humankind, but for Yahweh God. 2 So I have provided for the house of my God according to all my strength, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and the wood for the things of wood, along with an abundance of onyx stones, stones for settings, stones of turquoise, and variegated stones, and all kinds of precious stones and alabaster stones. 3 And moreover, with respect to my provisions for the house of my God I have a treasure of gold and silver that I have given to the house of my God above all that I have provided for the holy house: 4 three thousand talents of gold from the gold of Ophir and seven thousand talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the houses, 5 gold for the golden things and silver for the silver things, for all the work by the hand of skilled craftsmen. Now who will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to Yahweh?” 6 Then the commanders of the families, the commanders of the tribes of Israel, and the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and the commanders of the work of the king offered themselves willingly. 7 And they gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. 8 And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of Yahweh under the authority of Jehiel the Gershonite. 9 And the people rejoiced over their freewill offering, for with a whole heart they had willingly offered to Yahweh, and King David also rejoiced with great joy. 10 Then David blessed Yahweh in the sight of all the assembly, and David said, “Blessed are you, O Yahweh, God of Israel, our father forever and ever! 11 To you, O Yahweh, is the greatness and the power and the splendor and the glory and the strength, for everything in the heavens and in the earth. Yours, O Yahweh, is the kingdom and exaltation over all as head! 12 And wealth and glory are from you, and you rule over all. And in your hand is power and might. And in your hand is power to make great and to give strength to all. 13 And now, our God, we give thanks to you and offer praise to the name of your splendor. 14 And indeed, who am I, and who are my people that we retain power to offer according to these offerings willingly? For everything is from you, and from your hand we have given to you. 15 For we are strangers before you and sojourners like all our ancestors. Our days are like the shadow upon earth, and there is no hope of abiding. 16 O Yahweh our God, all this abundance that we have provided to build for you a house for your holy name is from your hand, and all of it is yours. 17 And I know, my God, that you yourself test the heart and are pleased with uprightness. I, in the uprightness of my heart, have willingly offered all these things, and now with joy I have seen your people who are found here willingly offer to you. 18 O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our ancestors, keep this forever as a plan and thoughts of the heart of your people, and establish their heart toward you. 19 Grant to Solomon my son a heart of peace to keep your commands, your statutes, and your regulations to do everything, and to build the citadel for which I have provided.” 20 And David said to all the assembly, “Bless Yahweh your God!” And all the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their ancestors. And they bowed down and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king. 21 And they offered sacrifices to Yahweh, and on that next day they offered burnt offerings to Yahweh: one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, one thousand lambs, with their libations and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. 22 And they ate and drank before Yahweh on that day with great joy. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and they anointed him commander for Yahweh, and Zadok the priest. 23 Then Solomon sat upon the throne of Yahweh as king in place of David his father. And he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him. 24 And all the officials and mighty warriors, and also all the sons of King David, pledged allegiance to King Solomon. 25 And Yahweh made Solomon exceedingly great in the sight of all Israel, and he bestowed upon him royal splendor that was not bestowed upon any king before him in Israel. 26 And David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 27 And the days that he reigned over Israel were forty years. In Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years. 28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, wealth, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his place. 29 Now the words of King David, from the first to the last, see, they are written among the words of Samuel the seer, and among the words of Nathan the prophet, and among the words of Gad the seer, 30 with all the accounts of his kingdom, his power, and the times that came upon him, and upon Israel, and upon all the kingdoms of the earth.

2 Chronicles,"1 And Solomon the son of David strengthened himself concerning his kingdom, and Yahweh his God was with him and made him exceedingly great. 2 And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the leaders for all Israel, the heads of the families. 3 And Solomon and the whole assembly with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for the tent of assembly of God that Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the desert was there. 4 (But the ark of God David had brought up from Kiriath-Jearim to the place David had prepared for it, for David had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.) 5 And the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh. And Solomon and the assembly sought it out. 6 And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the tent of assembly, and he offered upon it a thousand burnt offerings. 7 On that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask what I shall give to you.” 8 Then Solomon said to God, “You yourself have shown steadfast loyal love to David my father and have made me king in his place. 9 Now, O Yahweh God, let your word to David my father be fulfilled, for you yourself have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. 10 Now, give to me wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can judge this, your great people?” 11 Then God said to Solomon, “Because this was with your heart and you did not ask for wealth, possessions, honor, and the lives of your enemies, and also did not ask for long life, but have asked for wisdom and knowledge that you might judge my people over whom I have made you king, 12 wisdom and knowledge is given to you. And I will also give to you wealth, possessions, and honor, the like of which was not had by the kings who were before you, nor will there be the like after you.” 13 So Solomon went from the high place which was at Gibeon to Jerusalem before the tent of assembly. And he reigned over Israel. 14 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. And he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, and he placed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 15 And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem like the stones. And he made cedar as abundant as the sycamore fig trees that were in the Shephelah. 16 And Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue. The traders of the king received them from Kue at a price. 17 They went up and exported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for one hundred and fifty shekels. And these were likewise exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram. 1 And Solomon planned to build a house for the name of Yahweh and a royal palace for himself. 2 And Solomon assigned seventy thousand men to bear burdens and eighty thousand quarriers in the hill country, and three thousand six hundred men to supervise them. 3 And Solomon sent word to Huram king of Tyre, saying, “As you have dealt with David my father and sent cedar to him to build for himself a house in which to live, please deal with me. 4 Look, I am building a house for the name of Yahweh my God to dedicate to him, to offer sweet spices of incense before him, and for the regular rows of bread, and burnt offerings for mornings, evenings, Sabbaths, and new moon festivals, and for appointed feasts of Yahweh our God which are everlasting for Israel. 5 And the house that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods.

2 Chronicles,"5 And the house that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods. 6 Now who indeed has adequate strength to build a house for him? For the heavens and the highest heavens are not able to contain him. Now who am I that I would build a house for him, except to burn incense before him? 7 So then, send to me skilled men to work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and with purple, crimson, and blue fabric, knowledgeable in engraving, with the skilled men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father has established. 8 Send me trees of cedar, cypress, and algum from Lebanon, for I myself know that your servants are knowledgeable in cutting the trees of Lebanon. Now see, my servants will be with your servants 9 to prepare trees in abundance for me, for the house that I am building will be great and wonderful. 10 Now see, I will provide twenty thousand dry measures of crushed wheat, twenty thousand dry measures of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil to the woodcarvers and those who cut timber.” 11 Then Huram king of Tyre answered in a letter, and he sent word to Solomon: “Because Yahweh loves his people, he has made you king over them.” 12 Then Huram said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has made the heavens and the earth, who has given to King David a wise son knowing discretion and understanding, who will build for Yahweh a house and a royal palace for himself. 13 So now I have sent a skilled man, knowledgeable and with understanding: my master Huram, 14 a son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, knowledgeable for working with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and with purple, blue, and crimson fabric, and with fine linen, for engraving any engraving and devising any plan that is given to him, with your skilled men and the skilled men of my lord David your father. 15 Now as for the wheat, barley, oil, and wine that my lord mentioned, let him send that to his servants. 16 And we ourselves will cut trees from Lebanon according to all your need, and we will bring them to you on rafts over the sea to Joppa, so that you may bring them up to Jerusalem.” 17 Then Solomon counted all the resident alien men who were in the land of Israel after the census that David his father had taken of them. And there were found one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred. 18 And he appointed from them seventy thousand to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry in the hill country, and three thousand six hundred overseers to make the people work. 1 Then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah, where Yahweh had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had established, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 2 And he began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign. 3 Now these were the measurements of Solomon for building the house of God: the length in cubits by the former measurement was sixty cubits, and the width was twenty cubits. 4 The length of the portico that was in front was the same as the front of the width of the house: twenty cubits. And its height was one hundred and twenty cubits. And he overlaid it on the inside with pure gold. 5 And the great house itself he covered with cypress wood, then he overlaid it with pure gold. And he put on it palm tree images and ornate chains. 6 Then he overlaid the house with precious stone as decoration. (Now the gold was the gold of Parvaim.) 7 And he overlaid the house with gold—the beams, the thresholds, the walls, and the doors. And he carved cherubim upon the walls. 8 Then he made the most holy place. Its length was equal to the width of the house: twenty cubits. And its breadth was twenty cubits. And he overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold. 9 And the weight for the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid its upper rooms with gold. 10 And he made two sculpted wood cherubim in the most holy place, and he overlaid them with gold. 11 The length of the outstretched wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits; one wing of five cubits touched the wall of the house, and the other wing of five cubits was touching the outstretched wing of the other cherub. 12 And the wing of five cubits of the other cherub was touching the wall of the house, and its other wing five cubits long touching the wing of the first cherub. 13 The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits, and they were standing on their feet, their faces toward the house. 14 And he made the curtain of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen, and put cherubim on it. 15 And at the front of the house he made two columns, thirty-five cubits high, and the capital on their top was five cubits. 16 And he made decorative chains in the inner sanctuary and put them on top of the columns. And he made one hundred pomegranate ornaments, and put them on the chains. 17 And he erected the columns in front of the temple, one on the south and one on the north. He called the name of the southern one Jakin, and the name of the northern one Boaz. 1 And he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits was its length, and twenty cubits was its width, and ten cubits was its height. 2 Then he made the sea of molten metal, from brim to brim it was ten cubits, completely round. And it was five cubits in height, and its circumference measured thirty cubits. 3 Under it were figures of oxen all around it, ten cubits high, encircling the sea all around. The oxen were in two rows cast as one piece with it. 4 It was standing upon twelve oxen, three facing north, and three facing west, and three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set upon them from above, and all their hindquarters faced inward. 5 And its thickness was a handbreadth, and its brim was like the working of the lip of a cup, the blossom of a lily. And it held three thousand baths. 6 And he made ten basins. And he set five on the south and five on the north in which to wash; they washed off the work of the burnt offering in them, but the sea was for the priests to wash therein. 7 And he made ten golden lampstands according to their custom, and he set them in the temple, five on the south and five on the north. 8 And he made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south and five on the north. And he made a hundred drinking bowls of gold. 9 And he made the courtyard of the priests and the great outer courtyard and the doors for the outer court. And he overlaid their doors with bronze. 10 And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the temple. 11 And Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the drinking bowls. So Hiram finished making the work that he made on the house of God for King Solomon: 12 the two columns, the bowls, and the two capitals on top of the columns, and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on top of the columns, 13 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for the latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were before the columns. 14 And he made the water carts, and he made the basins on the water carts, 15 and the one sea and the twelve oxen underneath it. 16 And Huram-abi made for King Solomon the pots, the shovels, the three-pronged meat forks, and all the utensils of polished bronze for the house of Yahweh. 17 The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay soil between Succoth and Zeredah. 18 Solomon made all these utensils in great abundance, for the weight of the bronze could not be determined. 19 So Solomon made all the objects that were in the house of God: the altar of gold; the tables upon which was the bread of the presence; 20 the lampstands, and the lamps for burning according to the custom before the inner sanctuary, of solid gold; 21 and the blossoms, the lamps, and the tongs that were of solid gold; 22 and the snuffers, the drinking bowls, the dishes, and the firepans, of solid gold; and the entrance to the house, the inner doors to the most holy place, and the doors to the house of the temple were of gold. 1 When all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was finished, Solomon brought the holy objects of David his father: the silver, the gold, and all the objects he had put into the storehouses of the house of God. 2 Then Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the families for the Israelites, to Jerusalem in order to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh from the city of David, which is Zion. 3 And all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the feast that is in the seventh month. 4 And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. 5 And they brought up the ark, the tent of assembly, and all the holy objects that were in the tent; the Levitical priests brought them up. 6 And King Solomon and the whole community of Israel that was assembled before him were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted nor numbered for abundance. 7 Then the priests brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place in the inner sanctuary of the house, into the most holy place, underneath the wings of the cherubim. 8 The cherubim were spreading their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim were covering the ark and over its poles from above.

2 Chronicles,"9 But the poles were so long that the ends of the poles from the ark were seen from before the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from the outside. And they are there until this day. 10 There was nothing in the ark but the two stone tablets that Moses had put inside at Horeb on which Yahweh had made a covenant with the Israelites when they went out from Egypt. 11 And when the priests came out of the sanctuary (for all the priests who were present sanctified themselves without keeping their divisions) 12 and all the Levitical singers—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, their sons, their brothers, dressed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and stringed instruments—they were standing to the east of the altar. And with them outside were one hundred and twenty priests who were trumpet blowers. 13 And it was the primary duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard with one voice, to praise and give thanks to Yahweh. And when a sound from the trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments of song was raised to Yahweh—for he is good, because his loyal love is everlasting—then the house, the house of Yahweh, was filled with a cloud. 14 And the priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of God. 1 Then Solomon said, “Yahweh has decided to dwell in the deep gloom. 2 But I have built for you an exalted house, even a place for you to dwell in forever.” 3 Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, and all the assembly of Israel were standing. 4 And he said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth with David my father, and with his hands he has fulfilled it, saying, 5 ‘From the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt I did not choose a city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in order for my name to be there. Nor did I choose a man to be leader over my people Israel. 6 But I have chosen my name to be there in Jerusalem, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’ 7 Now, it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. 8 But Yahweh said to David my father, ‘Because it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart, 9 but you yourself will not build the house, but your son who will proceed from your loins; he himself will build the house for my name.’ 10 Now Yahweh has fulfilled his word that he spoke. I have risen in the place of David my father and am seated on the throne of Israel as Yahweh has spoken. I have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. 11 And I have there the ark in which is the covenant of Yahweh that he made with the Israelites.” 12 Then Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh before all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands. 13 (For Solomon had made a platform of bronze five cubits long and five cubits wide and three cubits high, and placed it in the midst of the outer court.) And he stood upon it, then knelt down on his knees before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands to heaven. 14 And he said, “O Yahweh, God of Israel, there is none like you, a God in the heavens and on the earth, keeping the covenant and loyal love with your servants who walk before you with all their heart, 15 that you have kept for your servant David my father what you spoke to him. You spoke with your mouth, and by your hand you have fulfilled it on this day. 16 And now, O Yahweh, God of Israel, keep for your servant David, my father, what you have spoken to him, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel before me, if only your sons keep their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.’ 17 And now, O Yahweh, God of Israel, let your word that you have spoken to your servant David be confirmed. 18 “But will God indeed dwell with humankind upon the earth? Look, the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain you! Surely then this house that I have built will not contain you! 19 But turn to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O Yahweh my God, to hearken to the pleading and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you, 20 that your eyes may be open day and night to this house, to the place that you have promised to place your name there, that you may hear the prayer that your servant has prayed to this place. 21 And listen to the pleas of your servant and your people Israel when they pray toward this place, that you yourself might hear from the place of your dwelling, from the heavens, that you might hear and forgive. 22 “If a man sins against his neighbor and makes him swear an oath and comes with an oath before your altar in this house, 23 then may you yourself hear from the heavens and act and judge your servants, to repay the guilty by bringing his way upon his head and to vindicate the righteous by giving to him according to his righteousness. 24 “And if your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against you and they repent and confess your name and pray and plead before you in this house, 25 then may you yourself hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your people Israel and again bring them back to the land that you gave to them and to their ancestors. 26 “When the heavens are stopped up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you and they pray to this place and confess your name and turn back from their sin when you humble them, 27 then may you yourself hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your servants and your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk, and give rain upon your land that you have given to your people as an inheritance. 28 “If there is a famine in the land; if there is disease, blight, mildew, locust, and caterpillar; if it happens that his enemy lays siege to him in the land and his gates; any kind of plague, any kind of disease, 29 then any prayer, any plea that is made by any person and by all your people Israel, each one who knows his own affliction and his own anguish and who spreads out his hands to this house, 30 then may you yourself hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, and forgive and give to each according to all his ways, since you alone know the heart of the children of humankind, 31 that they may fear you and walk in your ways all the days that they are alive upon the face of the land that you have given to our ancestors. 32 “And also, with respect to the foreigner, he who is not of your people Israel, but comes from a distant land, for the sake of your great name and your powerful hand and outstretched arm, when he comes and prays to this house, 33 then may you yourself hear from the heavens, from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner asks of you, so that all peoples of earth will know of your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that your name possesses this house that I have built. 34 “When your people go out to battle against their enemy according to the way that you have sent them, and they pray to you toward this city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name, 35 then may you hear their prayer and their pleas from the heavens and uphold their case. 36 When they sin against you—for there is no person who does not sin—and you become angry with them and place them before their enemy that they carry them away as captives to a land far or near, 37 but if they repent in the land where they were taken captive and repent and beg you for mercy in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned and acted perversely and done wickedly, 38 and we return to you,’ with their whole heart and with all their inmost being in the land of their captivity where they took them captive, and if they pray toward their land that you have given to their ancestors and the city that you have chosen and to the house that I have built for your name, 39 then may you hear their prayer and their pleas from the heavens, from your dwelling place, and uphold their case and forgive your people who sinned against you. 40 Now, O my God, please let your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayer of this place! 41 “And now arise, O Yahweh God, to your resting place, you and the ark of your strength! O Yahweh God, let the priests be clothed with salvation, and let your holy ones rejoice in your goodness! 42 O Yahweh God, do not turn away the face of your anointed one!

2 Chronicles,"1 And when Solomon finished praying, then fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of Yahweh filled the house. 2 And the priests were not able to go into the house of Yahweh, for the glory of Yahweh had filled the house. 3 When all the Israelites saw the fire come down and the glory of Yahweh upon the house, they knelt down with their faces to the ground on the pavement and worshiped and gave thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loyal love is everlasting. 4 Then the king and all the people were offering a sacrifice before Yahweh. 5 And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 6 And the priests stood at their posts with the Levites, with the instruments of the song of Yahweh that King David had made to give thanks to Yahweh—for his loyal love is everlasting—whenever David offered praise by their hand. Now the priests sounded trumpets standing opposite them, and all Israel stood. 7 And Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was before the house of Yahweh, for there he had made the burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, for the bronze altar that Solomon had made was not able to hold the burnt offerings, cereal offerings, and the fat. 8 And Solomon held a feast at that time of seven days. And all Israel was with him, a very great assembly, from Lebo-Hamath to the river of Egypt. 9 And on the eighth day they made a solemn assembly, for they held the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days. 10 And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents rejoicing and festive of heart on account of the goodness that Yahweh had done for David, Solomon, and Israel his people. 11 And Solomon finished the house of Yahweh and the house of the king. And all that came into the heart of Solomon to do with respect to the house of Yahweh and his own house he accomplished. 12 Then Yahweh appeared to Solomon at night and said to him, “I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice. 13 When I hold back the heavens so that there is not rain, and when I command the locust to devour the earth, and if I send disease among my people, 14 then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and will pray and will seek my face and will turn from their evil ways, then I myself shall hear from the heavens and will forgive their sins and heal their land.

2 Chronicles,"14 then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and will pray and will seek my face and will turn from their evil ways, then I myself shall hear from the heavens and will forgive their sins and heal their land. 15 Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place. 16 And now I have chosen and consecrated this house for my name to be there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time. 17 Now as for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked and do according to all that I have commanded you and will keep my ordinances and judgments, 18 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom as I promised to David your father, saying, ‘A man shall not be cut off for you from ruling over Israel.’ 19 “But if you turn yourselves away and forsake my ordinances and my commandments which I have given before you all and will go and serve other gods and bow down to them, 20 then I will uproot them from upon my land that I have given to them, and this house that I have consecrated for my name I will send away from before my face, and I will make it a proverb and a taunt among all the nations. 21 And as for this house, which was exalted, all who pass by it will be appalled and will say, ‘Why has Yahweh done thus to this land and to this house?’ 22 Then they will say, ‘Because they forsook Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, who brought them out from the land of Egypt, and they laid hold of other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore he has brought upon them all this evil.’ ” 1 And it happened that at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the house of Yahweh and his own house, 2 Solomon also built the cities that Huram had given to him, and he settled the Israelites in them. 3 And Solomon went to Hamath-Zobah and laid siege upon it. 4 And he built Tadmor in the desert, and he built all the storage cities in Hamath. 5 He also built Upper Beth-Horon and Lower Beth-Horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars; 6 Baalath and all the storage cities that belonged to Solomon; all the cities for chariots and cities for horses; and any desire of Solomon that he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 7 All the people who remained from the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites who were not from Israel, 8 from the descendants who were left over after them in the land, whom the Israelites had not destroyed, Solomon conscripted them as forced labor until this day. 9 But from the Israelites Solomon did not give as servants for his work, but they were men of war, his commanders of his officers, and commanders of his chariots and his horses. 10 And these were the commanders of the garrisons that belonged to King Solomon, two hundred and fifty who exercised authority over the people. 11 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David, king of Israel, for those places to which the ark of Yahweh has come are holy. 12 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh that he had built before the portico, 13 as was the daily requirement, to offer up according to the commandments of Moses for Sabbaths, new moon festivals, and the three annual feasts: the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths. 14 And in accord with the ordinance of David his father he appointed working groups of priests for their service, Levites for their responsibilities for praise and cultic service before the priests according to the daily requirement, and the gatekeepers in their working groups, gate by gate. For thus David the man of God had commanded. 15 And they did not turn aside from the commandment of the king concerning the priests and the Levites concerning anything, and concerning the treasury rooms. 16 And Solomon accomplished all the work from the day the foundation stone was laid for the house of Yahweh until its completion, and the house of Yahweh was finished. 17 Then Solomon went to Ezion-Geber, and to Elath, on the edge of the sea in the land of Edom. 18 And Huram sent to him, by the hand of his servants, ships and servants knowledgeable of the sea. And they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and from there they collected four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon. 1 Now the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, and she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with hard questions, with much wealth and camels, bearing spices and much gold and precious stones. And she came to Solomon and told him all that was on her mind. 2 And Solomon answered all her questions. Not a word was hidden from Solomon that he did not answer for her. 3 When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon and the house he had built, 4 and the food of his table, and the position of his officers, the duty of his servants and their clothing, his cupbearers and their clothing, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of Yahweh, there was no longer any breath in her. 5 And she said to the king, “The word which I heard in my land concerning your words and your wisdom is true, 6 but I did not believe their words until I came and saw with my own eyes. And behold, half the greatness of your wisdom was not reported to me; you surpass the rumors that I had heard. 7 Blessed are your men, and blessed are these your servants who stand before you regularly and hear your wisdom! 8 Blessed be Yahweh your God who took delight in you, to put you on his throne as king for Yahweh your God! Because your God loved Israel, he established him forever and has put you over them as king to do justice and righteousness!” 9 And she gave to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great amount of spices and precious stones. And there were no spices such as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. 10 Moreover the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir brought algum wood and precious stones. 11 And the king made steps for the house of Yahweh and the house of the king, and lyres and harps for the singers from the algum wood. And there was not seen anything like them before in the land of Judah. 12 Now King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba every desired thing she asked, besides what she had brought to the king. Then she turned and went to her land, she and her servants. 13 And it happened that the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, 14 besides that which traders and merchants brought, and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon. 15 And King Solomon made two hundred shields of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went into each shield. 16 And he made three hundred small shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels went into each small shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. 17 And the king made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold. 18 And the throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to the throne. And there were armrests on each side. And by the seat were two lions standing beside the armrests. 19 And twelve lions were standing there on each of the six steps on each end. And there was nothing like it made in all the kingdom. 20 And all the drinking vessels of King Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not valued as anything in the days of Solomon. 21 For the ships of the king went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram. Once every three years the ships of Tarshish came carrying gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. 22 Thus King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom. 23 And all the kings of the earth sought the face of Solomon to hear his wisdom that God put in his heart. 24 And each of them brought his gifts, objects of silver, objects of gold, cloaks, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, as an amount year by year. 25 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 26 And he ruled over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines, to the boundary of Egypt. 27 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar as the sycamore trees that are in the Shephelah for abundance. 28 And the horses were imported from Egypt and from all lands for Solomon. 29 As for the remainder of the words of Solomon from the first to the last, are they not written in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer, concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 30 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 31 And Solomon slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.

2 Chronicles,"1 Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 2 And it happened that when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it—now he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon—Jeroboam returned from Egypt. 3 And they sent and called him. Then Jeroboam and all Israel went, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 4 “Your father made our yoke heavy. Now, therefore, lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve you.” 5 And he said to them, “In three days return to me again.” And the people went away. 6 Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the elders who had been serving before Solomon his father when he was alive, saying, “What word do you advise to answer this people?” 7 And they said to him, “If you will be good to this people and please them, then speak good words to them. Then they will be your servants forever.” 8 But he forsook the advice of the elders that advised him and took counsel of the young men who had grown up with him who were serving before him. 9 And he said to them, “What do you advise that we should say in return to this people, who said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father has put upon us’?” 10 Then the young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus you should say to this people who have said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, so you yourself should lighten it for us.’ Thus you should say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father. 11 So now, my father laid upon you a heavy yoke, but I myself will add to the yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I myself will do so with scorpions.’ ” 12 Then Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king had spoken, saying, “Return to me on the third day.” 13 And the king answered them harshly, and King Rehoboam forsook the advice of the elders. 14 And he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “I will make your yoke heavy, and I myself will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will do so with scorpions.” 15 So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turning of events from God, so that Yahweh might fulfill his word that he had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat. 16 So all Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, and the people answered the king, saying, “What portion is there for us in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each to your tents, O Israel! Now look to your own house, David!” And all Israel went to their own tents. 17 But as for the Israelites who were living in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam ruled over them. 18 Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of the forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him with stones, and he died. Then King Rehoboam hastily went up into the chariot to flee to Jerusalem. 19 So Israel has rebelled against the house of David until this day. 1 When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors, to fight against Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam. 2 But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, the man of God, saying, 3 “Say to Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, 4 ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Do not go up, and do not fight against your brothers. Return, each man to his house, for this matter has come from me.” ’ ” So they obeyed the words of Yahweh and turned back from going against Jeroboam. 5 And Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built cities as strongholds in Judah. 6 He built Bethlehem, Etah, Tekoa, 7 Beth-Zur, Socoh, Adullam, 8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities that are in Judah and in Benjamin. 11 And he strengthened the fortifications and put commanders in them, along with stores of food, olive oil, and wine. 12 And in all the cities he put shields and spears, and he greatly strengthened them. So he had Judah and Benjamin. 13 Now the priests and the Levites who were throughout all Israel took their stand with him from all their territories. 14 For the Levites left their pasturelands and their property and came to Judah and to Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests to Yahweh. 15 And he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat idols and for the bull calves that he had made. 16 Then after them, from all the tribes of Israel, those who set their heart to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to offer to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors. 17 And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, secure for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years. 18 Then Rehoboam took to himself as a wife Mahalath, the daughter of Yerimot son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse. 19 And she bore to him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 20 And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, who bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 21 And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines (for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters). 22 And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as chief and crown prince over his brothers, in order to make him king. 23 And he dealt wisely and distributed some of his sons throughout all the land of Judah and Benjamin, through all the fortified cities, and gave abundant provisions to them and obtained many wives for them. 1 And when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and when he was strengthened, he forsook the law of Yahweh, and all Israel with him. 2 And it happened that in the fifth year of King Rehoboam (for they had acted unfaithfully against Yahweh), Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem 3 with one thousand two hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. And there was no number to the people who came up with him from Egypt—Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites. 4 And he took the fortified cities that belonged to Judah, and he came up to Jerusalem. 5 Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem from before Shishak. And he said to them, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘You yourselves have abandoned me, and I myself have surely abandoned you into the hand of Shishak.’ ” 6 Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “Yahweh is righteous.” 7 And when Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy. I will give to them some way of escape, that my anger not be poured out against Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. 8 However, they shall be his servants, that they might know my service and the service of the kingdoms of other countries.” 9 Then Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and he took the treasures out of the house of Yahweh and the treasures out of the king’s house. He took everything. He also took the small shields of gold that Solomon had made. 10 And King Rehoboam made small shields of bronze in their place and committed them into the hand of the commanders of the guards who were keeping the entrance of the house of the king.

2 Chronicles,"10 And King Rehoboam made small shields of bronze in their place and committed them into the hand of the commanders of the guards who were keeping the entrance of the house of the king. 11 And whenever the king went into the house of Yahweh, the guards came and carried them, and then they returned them to the alcove of the guards. 12 And when he humbled himself, the anger of Yahweh was turned away from him, so that he did not destroy the city completely. Moreover, matters were well in Judah. 13 So King Rehoboam was strengthened in Jerusalem, and he reigned there. Now, Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city where Yahweh had chosen to put his name out of all the tribes of Israel. And the name of his mother was Naamah the Ammonite. 14 And he did evil, for he did not set his heart to seek Yahweh. 15 Now the words of Rehoboam from the first to the last, are they not written in the chronicles of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer as a record? And there were battles between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days. 16 And Rehoboam slept with his ancestors, and he was buried in the city of David, and Abijah his son reigned in his place. 1 In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah reigned over Judah. 2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. Now there was war between Abijah and between Jeroboam. 3 And Abijah joined in the battle with an army of four hundred thousand battle-hardened warriors, chosen men, and Jeroboam put the battle in order against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, an army of mighty warriors. 4 Then Abijah stood up on top of Mount Zemaraim that is in the hill country of Ephraim and said, “Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel! 5 Do you not all know that Yahweh the God of Israel gave the kingdom to David over Israel forever, to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? 6 But Jeroboam the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master, 7 and worthless men, sons of wickedness, were gathered about him and became hostile against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was a boy and gentle of heart and was not strong enough to stand before them. 8 So now you yourselves are considering that you are strong before the kingdom of Yahweh which is in the hand of the sons of David, since you yourselves are a great multitude and you have bull calves of gold that Jeroboam has made for idols. 9 Did you not drive out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, the Levites? Have you not made for yourselves priests like all the peoples of the lands? All who come to be consecrated for priestly service with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of what is not a god. 10 But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests serving Yahweh are the sons of Aaron, the Levites, according to their service. 11 They offer burnt offerings to Yahweh every morning and every evening, sweet spices of incense, and the rows of bread upon the pure table. And the golden lampstand with its lamps they keep kindled every evening, for we are keeping the requirement of Yahweh our God, but you yourselves have forsaken him. 12 And look, God is with us at the head, and his priests have the trumpets for sounding blasts against you, O sons of Israel. Do not fight against Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, for you will not succeed.” 13 Then Jeroboam sent around an ambush to come behind them. So they were in front of Judah, but the ambush was behind them. 14 When Judah turned, then behold, the battle against them was in front and behind, and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests blew on the trumpets. 15 Then the men of Judah shouted, and it happened that when the men of Judah were shouting, then God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 16 And the Israelites fled from before Judah, and God gave them into their hand. 17 And Abijah and his people struck a great blow against them, and the dead from Israel that fell were five hundred thousand chosen men. 18 And the Israelites were subdued at that time, and the people of Judah were victorious, for they relied upon Yahweh the God of their ancestors. 19 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages. 20 And Jeroboam did not regain strength again in the days of Abijah. And Yahweh plagued him and he died. 21 But Abijah became strong, and he took to himself fourteen wives and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 22 Now the rest of the words of Abijah and his ways and his words are written in the story of the prophet Iddo. 1 And Abijah slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son became king in his place. In his days the land was at rest ten years. 2 Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God. 3 He removed the foreign altars and high places, broke down the stone pillars, and cut down the Asherahs. 4 And he commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, and to keep the law and the commandment. 5 And he removed the high places and the incense stands from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom had rest under him. 6 And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land was at rest. Under him there was no war in those years, for Yahweh had given rest to him. 7 And he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround them with walls, towers, gates, and bars while the land is before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God. We have sought and he has given rest to us on every side.” So they built and had success. 8 And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah, bearing shields and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin who carried shields and drew bows. All of these were mighty warriors of strength. 9 Zerah the Cushite came out against them with an army of a thousand thousands and three hundred chariots. And he came to Mareshah. 10 And Asa went out before him, and a battle was put in order in the valley of Zepah at Mareshah. 11 Then Asa cried out to Yahweh his God. And he said, “O Yahweh, there is none with you to help between the great and the powerless. Help us, O Yahweh our God, for we rely upon you, and in your name we have come against this multitude. O Yahweh, you are our God! Let no man prevail against you!” 12 So Yahweh defeated the Cushites before Asa and before Judah, and the Cushites fled. 13 Then Asa and the army with him pursued them to Gerar. And many from the Cushites fell, for they had no deliverance, for they were shattered before Yahweh and before his army. And they carried away much war booty. 14 And they struck all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of Yahweh was upon them. And they plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them. 15 And they also struck the tents of the herdsmen and carried away many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem. 1 Now Azariah the son of Oded—the Spirit of God came upon him. 2 And he went out before Asa and said to him, “Hear me, O Asa and all of Judah and Benjamin! Yahweh is with you while you are with him. And if you will seek him he will be found by you. But if you forsake him he will forsake you. 3 Now Israel has been without the true God many days, and without a teaching priest, and without law, 4 but at its trouble he returned to Yahweh, the God of Israel. They sought him, and he was found by them. 5 And in those times there was no peace for the one going out and the one coming in, for great tumults were upon all the inhabitants of the lands. 6 Nation was crushed by nation, and city was against city, for God threw them into confusion by all sorts of trouble. 7 But as for you, be strong and let not your hands be weak, for there is reward for your labor.” 8 And when Asa heard these words, the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage and removed the vile idols from all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities that he had taken in the hill country of Ephraim, and he repaired the altar of Yahweh that was in front of the portico of Yahweh. 9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin and those sojourning with them, from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for many had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him. 10 And they were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 11 And they sacrificed to Yahweh on that day from the war booty they brought back: seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. 12 And they entered into a covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, with all their heart and with all their inmost being, ",2 Chronicles 12:10-15:12,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/2-chronicles-1210-1512-20039/direct-download/tbd20080204.mp3
2 Chronicles,"13 but all who will not seek Yahweh the God of Israel should be killed, from young to old, from men to women. 14 And they took an oath to Yahweh with a great voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with horns. 15 And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they swore with all their heart. And they sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them, and Yahweh gave rest to them all around. 16 And also Maacah, the mother of Asa, the king removed her from being queen, because she had made a repulsive image for Asherah. And Asa cut down her repulsive image, and he crushed and burned it at the Wadi Kidron. 17 But the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was fully devoted all his days. 18 And he brought the holy objects of his father and his own holy objects into the house of God—silver and gold and vessels. 19 And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa. 1 In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha the king of Israel went up against Judah. And he built Ramah in order not to allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa, king of Judah. 2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold from the storehouses of the house of Yahweh and the house of the king, and he sent them to Ben-Hadad, king of Aram, who lived in Damascus, saying, 3 “There is a covenant between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Look, I am sending you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha, king of Israel, that he might withdraw from me.” 4 And Ben-Hadad listened to King Asa, and he sent commanders of his troops that were with him against the cities of Israel. And they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel-Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali. 5 And it happened that when Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work. 6 Then King Asa took all of Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building, and he built Geba and Mizpah with them. 7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, “On account of your reliance upon the king of Aram, and since you did not rely on Yahweh your God, therefore the troops of the king of Aram escaped from your hand. 8 Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with very abundant chariots and horsemen? And because of your reliance on Yahweh he gave them into your hand. 9 For the eyes of Yahweh roam throughout all the earth to strengthen those whose heart is fully devoted to him. You have been foolish in this, for from now on you will have wars.” 10 Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in the prison, for he was enraged with him concerning this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time. 11 Now behold, the words of Asa from the first to the last, behold, they are written in the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel. 12 And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, he fell severely ill in his feet. But even in his illness he did not seek Yahweh, but only among the healers. 13 And Asa slept with his ancestors. And he died in the forty-first year of his reign. 14 And they buried him in his burial site, which had been cut out for him in the city of David. And they laid him on the bier which they had filled with all kinds of spices made by the perfumers as a fragment ointment. And they made a great fire in his honor. 1 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and he strengthened himself against Israel. 2 And he put troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had taken. 3 And Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of David his father and did not seek after the Baals, 4 but he sought after the God of his ancestors and walked in his commandments and not according to the works of Israel. 5 So Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah gave tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had much wealth and honor. 6 And his heart was courageous in the ways of Yahweh. Moreover, he removed the high places and the Asherahs from Judah. 7 In the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; 8 and with them the Levites Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah; and with them the priests Elisham and Joram. 9 And they taught in Judah, and the scroll of the law of Yahweh was with them when they went around in all the cities of Judah, and they taught the people.

The Arabians also brought him seven thousand seven hundred sheep and seven thousand seven hundred goats. 12 And Jehoshaphat grew greater and greater, and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah. 13 And he had many supplies in the cities of Judah and mighty warriors for battle in Jerusalem. 14 Now these were their enrollment by the house of their ancestors: of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah, the commander, and with him were three hundred thousand mighty armed warriors; 15 and at his side, Jehohanan the commander, and with him were two hundred and eighty thousand; 16 and at his side, Amasiah the son of Zicri, who had made a freewill offering to Yahweh, and with him were two hundred thousand mighty armed warriors. 17 And from Benjamin: Eliada, a powerful mighty warrior, and with him were two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield; 18 and at his side, Jehozabad, and with him were one hundred and eighty thousand armed for war. 19 These were serving the king, besides those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah. 1 Now Jehoshaphat had much wealth and honor, and he became son-in-law to Ahab. 2 And after some years he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and for the people who were with him, and urged him to go up against Ramoth-Gilead. 3 And Ahab the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, “Will you go up with me to Ramoth-Gilead?” And he answered him, “I am as you are, and my people are as your people with you in war.” 4 Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Seek first of all the word of Yahweh.” 5 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets, four hundred men. And he said to them, “Shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall we cease?” And they said, “Go up, since God will give it into the hand of the king.” 6 Then Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not here another prophet of Yahweh that we might inquire of him?” 7 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom to seek Yahweh, but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but always disaster. He is Micaiah the son of Imlah.” Then Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say thus.” 8 Then the king of Israel called to a eunuch and said, “Quickly bring Micaiah the son of Imlah.” 9 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were each sitting on his throne, clothed in robes. And they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 10 And Zedekiah the son of Kenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and he said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘With these you will gore Aram to their destruction.’ ” 11 And all the prophets prophesied thus, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-Gilead and triumph! Yahweh will give it into the hand of the king.” 12 Then the messenger who went to call Micaiah said to him, “Behold, the words of the prophets are good with one voice to the king. Please let your word be as one with them and speak good.” 13 But Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives, only what my God has said, that will I speak.” 14 And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to war or shall I cease?” And he said, “Go up and triumph! They shall be given into your hand.” 15 But the king said to him, “How many times shall I make you swear that you speak nothing except the truth in the name of Yahweh?” 16 Then he said, “I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains like sheep that had no shepherd. And Yahweh said, ‘These have no masters; let each of them return to his own house in peace.’ ” 17 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not say to you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but only disaster?” 18 Then Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting upon his throne with all the host of heaven standing on his right and on his left. 19 And Yahweh said, ‘Who will entice Ahab the king of Israel that he would go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead?’ And one said this, and another said that. 20 Then a spirit came forth and stood before Yahweh and said, ‘I will entice him.’ Then Yahweh said to him, ‘By what means?’ 21 Then he said, ‘I will go forth and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he said, ‘You will entice him and will also succeed. Go out and do so.’ 22 So now, behold, Yahweh has put a spirit of deception into the mouths of these your prophets. Yahweh has spoken disaster against you.” 23 Then Zedekiah the son of Kenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, “Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh come from me to speak to you?” 24 Then Micaiah said, “Behold, you will see on that day when you go into a private room to hide yourself.” 25 Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the commander of the city and to Jehoash the son of the king, 26 and say, ‘Thus says the king: “Put this one into the prison house, and let him eat a meager ration of bread and water until I return in peace.” ’ ” 27 And Micaiah said, “If you surely return in peace Yahweh has not spoken with me.” Then he said, “Hear, peoples, all of them!” 28 Then the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-Gilead. 29 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you, wear your garments.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went to war. 30 Now the king of Aram had commanded the commanders of his chariots, saying, “Do not fight with the small or the great, but only with the king of Israel.” 31 And it happened that when the commanders of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, then they said, “It is the king of Israel!” And they turned against him to fight. Then Jehoshaphat cried out and Yahweh helped him. God drove them away from him. 32 And it happened that when the commanders of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from following him. 33 Now a certain man drew the bow at random and struck the king of Israel between the soldering of his breastplate armor. Then he said to the chariot driver, “Turn around; get me away from the war camp, for I am wounded.” 34 And the battle went on that day, and the king of Israel was propped up in the chariot facing Aram until the evening. And he died at the time of the going down of the sun. 1 Then Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. 2 And Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him. And he said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you be a help to the wicked and love those who hate Yahweh? On account of this, wrath has come against you from Yahweh.

2 Chronicles,"1 Then Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. 2 And Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him. And he said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you be a help to the wicked and love those who hate Yahweh? On account of this, wrath has come against you from Yahweh. 3 Nevertheless some good things have been found in regard to you, for you burned the Asherahs out of the land and set your heart to seek God.” 4 And Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and returned and went out among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors. 5 And he appointed judges in the land and in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city. 6 And he said to the judges, “Consider what you are doing, for you are not judging for a man but for Yahweh. Now he is with you in speaking justice. 7 So now, let the fear of Yahweh be upon you all. Be careful what you do, for there is neither wickedness nor showing partiality and taking bribes with Yahweh our God.” 8 Moreover, Jehoshaphat appointed in Jerusalem some of the Levites and the priests and heads of the families of Israel as judges and to decide legal disputes for Yahweh. And they sat in Jerusalem. 9 And he commanded them, saying, “Thus you must do in the fear of Yahweh in faithfulness and with a whole heart. 10 Any legal dispute that comes before you from your brothers who live in their cities concerning bloodguilt, law, commandment, statutes, and justice, you must warn them, so that they do not incur guilt before Yahweh, and that wrath may not come upon you and your brothers. Thus you must do that you do not incur guilt. 11 And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Yahweh, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the governor of the house of Judah, in all matters of the king, and the Levites shall be before you as officials. Be strong and do well! May Yahweh be with the upright.” 1 And it happened that afterward, the Moabites, the Ammonites, and some of the Meunites came against Jehoshaphat for war. 2 And they came and reported it to Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude from beyond the sea, from Aram, is coming against you. Now behold, they are in Hazazon Tamar” (that is, En Gedi). 3 Then Jehoshaphat was afraid and set his face to seek Yahweh. And he called for a fast through all Judah. 4 And Judah assembled to seek after Yahweh; even from all the cities of Judah they came to seek Yahweh. 5 Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of Yahweh before the new courtyard. 6 And he said, “O Yahweh, God of our ancestors, are you not God in heaven? Now you rule in all the kingdoms of the nations, and in your hand are power and might, and there is none who can resist against you. 7 O, our God, did you yourself not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it to the descendants of Abraham your friend forever? 8 And they lived in it and built for you a sanctuary for your name in it, saying, 9 ‘If disaster, a sword, punishment, disease, or famine come upon us, we shall stand before this house and before you—for your name is in this house—and cry out to you out of our trouble, then you will hear and save us.’ 10 And now, look, the people of Moab and Ammon and Mount Seir whom you did not allow Israel to come against when they came from Egypt, from whom they turned aside and did not destroy, 11 now behold, they are rewarding us by coming to dispossess us from your possession which you gave us as an inheritance. 12 O our God, will you not judge them, for there is no power in us before this great multitude that is coming against us. Now we do not know what we shall do, for our eyes are upon you.” 13 And all Judah was standing before Yahweh, and also their little children, their wives, and their children. 14 Then the Spirit of Yahweh came upon Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite from the descendants of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly. 15 And he said, “Listen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat, thus says Yahweh to you: ‘Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed before this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God’s. 16 Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they are coming up the ascent of Ziz. And you will find them at the end of the valley facing the desert of Jeruel. 17 There will be no need for you to fight in this battle. Take your stand! Stand and see the deliverance of Yahweh among you, O Judah and Jerusalem! Do not fear and do not be dismayed. Tomorrow go out before them and Yahweh will be with you.’ ” 18 Then Jehoshaphat bowed his face down to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before Yahweh to worship Yahweh. 19 Then the Levites, from the Kohathites and from the Korahites stood up to praise Yahweh the God of Israel with an exceedingly loud voice. 20 And they rose up early in the morning and went out to the desert of Tekoa. And when they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Hear me, O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in Yahweh your God, and you shall be established! Believe in his prophets, and you shall succeed!” 21 And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed singers to Yahweh who were giving praise to the splendor of his holiness when they went out before the army. And they said, “Give thanks to Yahweh, for his loyal love is everlasting!” 22 And when they began with singing and praise, Yahweh set ambushes against the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir who were coming against Judah. And they were defeated 23 when the people of Ammon and Moab rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to destroy and demolish them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, each helped to destroy his comrade. 24 And Judah came against the watchtower of the wilderness. And they looked at the crowd, and behold, corpses were lying on the ground. There was none who had escaped. 25 When Jehoshaphat came with his people to plunder their booty, they found among them in abundance possessions, corpses, and precious items. And they took plunder for themselves until they could carry no more. And they were three days in plundering the booty, for it was abundant. 26 And on the fourth day, they assembled in the Valley of Berakah, for there they blessed Yahweh. Therefore the name of that place is called the Valley of Berakah up to this day. 27 And all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned, and Jehoshaphat was at their head in returning to Jerusalem with joy, for Yahweh caused them to rejoice over their enemies. 28 And they came to Jerusalem with harps, stringed instruments, and trumpets to the house of Yahweh. 29 And the fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of the earth when they heard that Yahweh had fought against the enemies of Israel. 30 So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at rest, since his God gave rest to him all around. 31 So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign. And he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi. 32 And he walked in the way of his father Asa and did not turn aside from it, to do what was right in the eyes of Yahweh. 33 Only the high places were not removed. The people still had not yet set their heart on the God of their ancestors. 34 Now the rest of the words of Jehoshaphat, from the first to the last, behold, they are written in the chronicles of Jehu the son of Hanani, which are recorded in the scroll of the kings of Israel. 35 And afterward Jehoshaphat the king of Judah joined with Ahaziah the king of Israel, who acted wickedly. 36 He joined with him to build ships to go to Tarshish. And they built the ships in Ezion Geber. 37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because of your joining with Ahaziah, Yahweh will break down your works.” And the ships were destroyed and were not able to go to Tarshish. 1 And Jehoshaphat slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David, and Jehoram his son reigned in his place. 2 Now he had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel. 3 And their father gave to them many gifts of silver, gold, and valuables, with fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, for he was the firstborn. 4 When Jehoram ascended to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and murdered all his brothers with the sword, and even some of the princes of Israel. 5 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did evil in the sight of Yahweh. 7 But Yahweh was not willing to destroy the house of David on account of the covenant that he had made with David and since he had promised to give a lamp to him and to his descendants forever.

2 Chronicles,"7 But Yahweh was not willing to destroy the house of David on account of the covenant that he had made with David and since he had promised to give a lamp to him and to his descendants forever. 8 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and they set up a king of their own. 9 Then Jehoram passed over with his commanders and all the chariots with him, and when night came he struck Edom who was all around him and the commanders of his chariots. 10 So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah until this day. Then Libnah also revolted at that time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Yahweh, the God of his ancestors. 11 Moreover, he made high places in the hill country of Judah, and he enticed the inhabitants of Jerusalem to be unfaithful, and he led Judah astray. 12 And a letter from Elijah the prophet came to him, saying, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father: ‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father or in the ways of Asa, the king of Judah, 13 but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel and have enticed Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to be unfaithful like the unfaithfulness of the house of Ahab, and have also murdered your brothers of the house of your father who were better than you, 14 behold, Yahweh is inflicting a great plague on your people, your children, your wives, and all your possessions, 15 and you yourself will be afflicted with great illness, with sickness in your bowels, until your bowels come out on account of the illness, day by day.’ ” 16 And Yahweh stirred up the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabs who were near the Cushites against Jehoram. 17 And they came up against Judah and invaded it and carried away all the possessions found in the house of the king, and also his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except Jehoahaz his youngest son. 18 And after all this Yahweh afflicted him in his bowels with an illness for which there was no cure. 19 And it happened that after many days, at the end of two years, his bowels came out because of his illness, and he died in terrible agony. And his people did not make a fire for him like the fire for his ancestors. 20 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he departed with no one’s regret. And they buried him in the city of David, but not in the burial sites of the kings. 1 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, for the band of men who had come with the Arabs to the camp had murdered all the older sons. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, reigned. 2 Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri. 3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor for doing wickedness. 4 And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh as the house of Ahab had done, for they were his counselors to his destruction after the death of his father. 5 He also walked in their counsel and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-Gilead. And the Arameans wounded Joram. 6 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds he had suffered at Ramah, when he made war against Hazael king of Aram. And Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram son of Ahab in Jezreel for he was sick. 7 But the downfall of Ahaziah was from God, and intended to come to Joram. And when he came, he went out with Jehoram to Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab. 8 And it happened that when Jehu was judging the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah who ministered to Ahaziah, and he killed them. 9 And he searched for Ahaziah and captured him. And he was hiding in Samaria. And they brought him to Jehu and put him to death. And they buried him, for they said, “He is the descendant of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with his whole heart.” And the house of Ahab had no one to exercise power over the kingdom. 10 Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and murdered all the royal descendants of the house of Judah. 11 But Jehosheba the daughter of the king took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, and kidnapped him away from the sons of the king who were to be put to death. And she put him and his nurse in a private bedroom. So Jehosheba the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, because she was a sister of Ahaziah, hid him from before Athaliah so that she did not put him to death. 12 And he was hidden with them in the house of God six years, but Athaliah reigned over the land. 1 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself and took with him into a covenant relationship the commanders of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zicri. 2 And they went around in Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the families of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. 3 And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, “Behold, the son of the king shall reign as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David. 4 This is the thing that you must do: one third of you priests and Levites coming off duty on the Sabbath shall be gatekeepers at the entrances, 5 and one third at the house of the king, and one third at the Gate of the Foundation. And all the people shall be in the courtyards of the house of Yahweh. 6 Let no one enter into the house of Yahweh except the priests and the ministering Levites. They themselves may enter, for they are holy, but all the people shall keep the requirements of Yahweh. 7 And the Levites shall surround the king all around, each with his weapons in his hand. And whoever comes into the house shall be put to death. You shall be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.” 8 And the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And they each took his men who were coming off duty on the Sabbath with the ones going out to duty on the Sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the working groups. 9 And Jehoiada the priest gave the spears and the large shields and small shields that had belonged to King David that were in the house of God to the commanders of hundreds. 10 And he appointed all the people, each with his weapon in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house, all around the king. 11 Then they brought out the son of the king and set upon him the crown and gave him the statute and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said, “Long live the king!” 12 When Athaliah heard the sound of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people at the house of Yahweh. 13 And she looked and, behold, the king was standing by his column at the entrance, and the commanders and trumpeters beside the king, along with all the people of the land, rejoicing and blowing with trumpets, and the singers with the instruments of song leading the praise. And Athaliah tore her garments and cried, “Conspiracy! Conspiracy!” 14 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the commanders of the hundreds appointed over the troops, and he said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks, and whoever goes after her shall be put to death with the sword.” For the priest had said, “You must not kill her in the house of Yahweh.” 15 And they laid hands on her, and she went into the entrance of the Horse Gate of the house of the king, and they killed her there. 16 And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king, that they should be Yahweh’s people. 17 Then all the people went to the house of Baal and broke it down. And they smashed his altars and his images, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 18 And Jehoiada placed appointees at the house of Yahweh under the hand of the Levitical priests whom David had allotted to the house of Yahweh to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh as was written in the law of Moses, with joy and with song, according to the order of David. 19 And he set the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of Yahweh so that no person unclean with respect to any matter could enter. 20 And he took the commanders of hundreds, the noblemen, the governors over the people, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of Yahweh. And they came through the upper gate to the house of the king, and they set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. 21 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been killed with the sword. 1 Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. 2 And Joash did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest. 3 And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he fathered sons and daughters.

2 Chronicles,"1 Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. 2 And Joash did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest. 3 And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he fathered sons and daughters. 4 And afterward it was in the heart of Joash to repair the house of Yahweh. 5 So he gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah and gather money from all Israel to strengthen the house of your God sufficiently year by year. Now you yourselves must hasten to the matter.” But the Levites did not act with haste. 6 So the king called Jehoiada the chief, and he said to him, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring from Judah and Jerusalem the tax of Moses, the servant of Yahweh, and of the assembly of Israel for the tent of the testimony?” 7 For the sons of the wicked Athaliah had broken into the house of God and had used all the holy vessels of the house of Yahweh for the Baals. 8 Then the king commanded, and they made a chest and put it at the gate outside the house of Yahweh. 9 And they issued a proclamation in Judah and in Jerusalem to bring to Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God had levied upon Israel in the wilderness. 10 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and they brought their tax and threw it into the chest until it was finished. 11 And whenever he brought the chest to the appointee of the king by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money in it, then the secretary of the king and the officer of the chief priest came and emptied the chest, then they took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance. 12 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of Yahweh. And they hired stonemasons and skilled craftsmen to restore the house of Yahweh, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of Yahweh. 13 So those doing the work labored, and the restoration for the work made progress under their hand. And they restored the house of God to its position and strengthened it. 14 And when they had finished, they brought the remainder of the money before the king and Jehoiada, and they used it for objects for the house of Yahweh, objects for the service and the burnt offerings, dishes, and objects of gold and silver. And they were offering burnt offerings in the house of Yahweh regularly, all the days of Jehoiada. 15 And Jehoiada grew old and full of days, and he died; he was one hundred and thirty years old at his death. 16 And they buried him in the city of David with the kings, for he did good in Israel and with respect to God and his house. 17 Now after the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah came and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them. 18 And they forsook the house of Yahweh, the God of their ancestors and served the Asherahs and the idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem on account of this guilt. 19 But he sent prophets among them, to bring them back to Yahweh. And they testified against them, and they did not obey. 20 Then the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, and he stood above the people and said to them, “Thus says God: ‘Why are you transgressing the commandments of Yahweh so that you will not succeed? For you have forsaken Yahweh, so he will forsake you.’ ” 21 Then they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the command of the king in the courtyard of the house of Yahweh. 22 So King Joash did not remember the loyal love that Jehoiada his father had shown to him, and he killed his son. And as he was dying he said, “May Yahweh see and avenge!” 23 And it happened at the turn of the year that the army of Aram went up against him, and they came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the commanders of the people from among the people, and all the war booty they sent to the king of Damascus. 24 Though the army of Aram came with few men, Yahweh gave a very large army into their hand, for they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their ancestors. And they inflicted punishment on Joash. 25 And when they were going away from him (for they had left him with many wounds), his servants conspired against him on account of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest. So they killed him on his bed and he died. And they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him at the burial sites of the kings. 26 Now these are the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath, the Ammonite, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith, the Moabite. 27 And as for his sons, the many oracles against him, and his repair of the foundation of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the scroll of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his place. 1 Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king. And he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother was Jehoaddan from Jerusalem. 2 And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, only not with a fully-devoted heart. 3 And it happened that as his reign was strengthened, he killed his servants who had killed his father the king. 4 But he did not put their children to death, according to what is written in the law, in the scroll of Moses, where Yahweh commanded, saying, “Fathers shall not be put to death on account of the sons, and the sons shall not be put to death on account of the fathers, but each shall be put to death for his own sin.” 5 Then Amaziah assembled the men of Judah and set them by families under commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. And he counted them from twenty years old and above, and found them to be three hundred thousand chosen for going out to battle, able with spear and shield. 6 And he hired from Israel one hundred thousand strong, mighty warriors for one hundred talents of silver. 7 But a man of God came to him, saying, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for Yahweh is not with Israel, all the Ephraimites. 8 But even still, you yourself go, do! Be strong for the battle else God will make you stumble before the enemy! For there is power with God to help and to cause stumbling.” 9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, “Now what should I do with the one hundred talents that I have given to the troops of Israel?” And the man of God said, “Yahweh is able to give to you more than this.” 10 Then Amaziah dismissed the troops that came to him from Ephraim to go to their home. And they became very angry with Judah, and they returned to their home in great anger. 11 Then Amaziah strengthened himself, and leading his army, he went to the Valley of Salt. And he struck down ten thousand men of Seir. 12 Now the men of Judah captured ten thousand others alive, and they brought them to the top of the rock and threw them from the top of the rock. So all of them were smashed to pieces. 13 As for the troops Amaziah had sent back from going with him to war, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth-Horon. And they struck down three thousand of them and plundered much booty. 14 And it happened that after Amaziah came back from killing the Edomites, he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, and he stood them up to himself as gods and bowed down before them and make smoke offerings for them. 15 So Yahweh became very angry with Amaziah and sent a prophet to him, and he said to him, “Why have you sought the gods of the people who could not deliver their own people from your hand?” 16 And it happened that while he was speaking to him, he said to him, “Have we appointed you as a counselor to the king? Stop—why should you be killed?” So the prophet stopped and said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my advice.” 17 Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel, and he sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face one another. 18 And Joash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thorn bush that is in Lebanon has sent to the cedar which is in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife.’ But a wild animal of the field that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thorn bush. 19 Look, you say that you have struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up to boast. Now remain at your home. Why stir up disaster that you fall, you and Judah with you?” 20 But Amaziah did not listen, for it was from God that he might give them into the hand of enemies, because they sought the gods of Edom. 21 So Joash the king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah the king of Judah faced one another at Beth-Shemesh, which belongs to Judah. 22 And Judah was defeated before Israel, and each man fled to his tent. 23 And Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah the king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-Shemesh. And they brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, four hundred cubits. 24 Then with all the gold and silver, all the objects found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the storehouses of the house of the king, and the hostages, he returned to Samaria. 25 And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel, fifteen years. 26 Now the remainder of the words of Amaziah, from the first to the last, behold, are they not written in the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel? 27 And from the time that Amaziah turned away from Yahweh, they had plotted a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. And he fled to Lachish, but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. 28 And they carried him on the horses and buried him with his ancestors in the city of Judah. 1 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah (now he was sixteen years old) and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah. 2 He built Elath and returned it to Judah after the king slept with his ancestors. 3 Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. And the name of his mother was Yecoliah of Jerusalem. 4 And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Amaziah his father had done. 5 And he began to seek God in the days of Zechariah who was teaching in visions of God. And whenever he sought Yahweh God made him have success.

2 Chronicles,"4 And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Amaziah his father had done. 5 And he began to seek God in the days of Zechariah who was teaching in visions of God. And whenever he sought Yahweh God made him have success. 6 And he went out and made war against the Philistines, and he broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod, and he built cities in Ashdod and among the Philistines. 7 And God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who were living in Gur-Baal and Meunim. 8 And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah, and his fame went out to the boundary of Egypt, for he became very strong. 9 And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, and he strengthened them. 10 And he built towers in the desert and hewed many cisterns, for he had much livestock, both in the Shephelah and on the plain, along with farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil. 11 And Uzziah had troops trained and ready for war in divisions according to the number of their enrollment at the hand of Jeuel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah of the king’s commanders. 12 The whole number of the heads of the families for mighty warriors of strength was two thousand six hundred. 13 And under their hand were army troops numbering three hundred and seven thousand five hundred who could make war with power and strength to help the king against an enemy. 14 And Uzziah prepared small shields, spears, helmets, breastplates, bows, and slingstones for the whole army. 15 And he made siege machines in Jerusalem designed by skillful men to be set upon the towers and upon the corners to shoot arrows and large slingstones. And his fame went out far, for he helped marvelously, for he was strong. 16 But on account of his strength his heart grew proud unto destruction. And he acted unfaithfully against Yahweh his God and went into the temple of Yahweh to offer an incense offering on the altar. 17 And Azariah the priest, and eighty strong priests of Yahweh with him, went in after him. 18 And they stood against King Uzziah and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but it is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have acted unfaithfully. There will be no honor for you from Yahweh God.” 19 Then Uzziah, his censer in hand to burn incense, became angry. And when he became angry with the priests, then leprosy appeared on his forehead in front of the priests in the house of Yahweh at the altar of incense. 20 When Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned to him, behold, he was leprous in the forehead. So they rushed him away from there, and he also hastened to go out, for Yahweh had smitten him. 21 So King Uzziah was leprous until the day of his death, and he lived in a separate house as a leper, for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh. And Jotham his son was over the house of the king, judging the people of the land. 22 Now the remainder of the words of Uzziah, from the first to the last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote them. 23 And Uzziah slept with his ancestors, and they buried him with his ancestors in the burial field which belonged to the kings, because, they said, “He was leprous.” And Jotham his son reigned in his place. 1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. 2 And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Uzziah had done—only he did not go into the temple of Yahweh. But the people still acted corruptly. 3 He built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and he did much restoration on the wall of Ophel. 4 And he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and he built forts and towers in the wooded places. 5 Now he fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. And the Ammonites gave to him in that year one hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand measures of barley. This is what the Ammonites rendered to him, as well as in the second and third year. 6 And Jotham strengthened himself, for he established his ways before Yahweh his God. 7 Now the remainder of the words of Jotham and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written upon the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah. 8 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 9 And Jotham slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David. And his son Ahaz became king in his place. 1 Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what is right in the eyes of Yahweh like David his ancestor. 2 But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and also made molten idols for the Baals. 3 And he himself burned incense in the valley of Ben-Hinnom and burned his sons in the fire, according to the detestable practices of the nations whom Yahweh drove out before the Israelites. 4 And he sacrificed and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops, and under every flourishing tree.

2 Chronicles,"5 Then Yahweh his God gave him into the hand of the king of Aram who defeated him and captured many captives from him and brought them to Damascus. Moreover, he was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, and he defeated him by a great attack. 6 And Pekah, the son of Remaliah, killed in one day one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah, all men of strength, because they forsook Yahweh the God of their ancestors. 7 And Zikri, a mighty warrior of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the son of the king, Azrikam the commander of the house, and Elkanah the second to the king. 8 And the Israelites captured two hundred thousand of their brothers, women, sons, and daughters. And they also plundered much booty from them and brought the booty to Samaria. 9 Now a prophet of Yahweh was there; Oded was his name. And he went out before the army that was coming to Samaria and said to them, “Look, it is on account of the anger of Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, against Judah that he gave them into your hands, and you killed them in a rage reaching to the heavens. 10 So now, you yourselves plan to subdue people of Judah and Jerusalem as slaves and female servants for yourselves. Is there not also guilt on your part against Yahweh your God? 11 So now, listen to me and return the captives of your brothers whom you have taken captive, for the fierce anger of Yahweh is against you.” 12 Then men from the heads of Ephraim—Azariah the son of Jehohanan, Berekiah the son of Meshillemoth, Hezekiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai—stood against those returning from the fight. 13 And they said to them, “You shall not bring the captives here, for it is as guilt against Yahweh upon us. You yourselves plan to add to our sins and to our guilt, but our guilt is very great, and there is great anger against Israel.” 14 So the soldiers left the captives and the plunder before the commanders and all the assembly. 15 Then the men designated by name arose and took the captives and from the plunder clothed all their nakedness. So they clothed them, gave them sandals, gave them food to eat, gave them water to drink, anointed them, and guided them with the donkeys provided for all those who stumbled, and brought them to Jericho, the city of the palm trees, next to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria. 16 At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria to help him, 17 since again the Edomites came and struck against Judah and took captives. 18 And the Philistines sent raids into the cities of the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah. And they captured Beth-Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Socoh with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages. And they settled there. 19 For Yahweh subdued Judah for the sake of Ahaz, king of Israel, for he created disorder in Judah and acted unfaithfully against Yahweh. 20 Then Tiglath-Pileser the king of Assyria came against him and brought trouble for him, instead of helping him, 21 for Ahaz took a portion from the house of Yahweh and the house of the king and the princes, and he gave it to the king of Assyria, but it was no help to him. 22 And in the time of his distress, King Ahaz continued to act unfaithfully against Yahweh. 23 He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him and said, “Because the gods of the king of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to them so that they will help me.” But they were a disaster to him and to all Israel. 24 Then Ahaz gathered the objects of the house of God, and he cut the objects of the house of God to pieces. And he shut the doors of the house of Yahweh and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem. 25 And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and he provoked Yahweh, the God of his ancestors, to anger. 26 Now the remainder of his words and all his ways, from the first to the last, behold, they are written upon the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel. 27 And Ahaz slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him to the burial site of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son became king in his place. 1 Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. 2 And he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done. 3 In the first year of his kingship, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of Yahweh and strengthened them. 4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and he gathered them into the eastern square. 5 And he said to them, “Hear me, O Levites! Sanctify yourselves now, and sanctify the house of Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, and bring out the defilement from the sanctuary. 6 For our ancestors acted unfaithfully and did evil in the sight of Yahweh our God, and have forsaken him and turned away their faces from the dwelling place of Yahweh. They have turned their backs on it. 7 They also shut the doors of the portico and extinguished the lamps. And they did not burn incense or offer burnt offerings in the sanctuary to the God of Israel. 8 And the wrath of Yahweh was upon Judah and Jerusalem. And he made them as an abhorrence, as a desolation and an object of scorn, as you see with your own eyes. 9 Now behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity on account of this. 10 Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger might turn away from him. 11 Now, my sons, do not be negligent, for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him to serve him and to be his servants and incense burners.” 12 Then the Levites arose—Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, from the Kohathites; and Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel from the Merarites; and Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah, from the Gershonites. 13 And from the descendants of Elizaphan: Shimri and Jeiel; and from the descendants of Asaph: Zechariah and Mattaniah; 14 and from the descendants of Heman: Jeiel and Shimei; and from the descendants of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel— 15 and they gathered their brothers and sanctified themselves, and they went in according to the command of the king because of the words of Yahweh, to purify the house of Yahweh. 16 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of Yahweh to purify it. And they brought out all the impurity that they found in the temple of Yahweh out to the courtyard of the house of Yahweh. And the Levites took them to bring them outside to the Wadi Kidron. 17 And they began to sanctify themselves on the first day of the first month. And on the eighth day of the month they came to the portico of Yahweh. And they sanctified the house of Yahweh for eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished. 18 And they went into the inner part to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed all the house of Yahweh: the altar of burnt offering, all its objects, the table of the rows of bread and all its objects, 19 and all the objects that King Ahaz discarded in his reign when he sinned, we have prepared and sanctified. Look, they are before the altar of Yahweh.” 20 Then King Hezekiah rose early and gathered the officials of the city, and he went up to the house of Yahweh. 21 And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a purification offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the descendants of Aaron, the priests, to offer them on the altar of Yahweh. 22 And they slaughtered the cattle, and the priests received the blood and threw it toward the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and threw the blood toward the altar, and then they slaughtered the lambs and threw the blood toward the altar. 23 Then they brought the goats of the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid hands upon them. 24 And the priest killed them and offered their blood against the altar to make atonement for all Israel, for the king had commanded the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel. 25 And he stood the Levites in the house of Yahweh with cymbals, harps, and lyres, according to the command of David and Gad, the seer of the king, and Nathan the prophet, for the command was by the hand of Yahweh by the hand of his prophets. 26 When the Levites stood with the objects of David and the priests with the trumpets, 27 Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And at the time the burnt offering began, the song of Yahweh began, and also the trumpets, at the hands of the instruments of David king of Israel. 28 Then all the assembly bowed down, and the song was sung, and the trumpeters trumpeted—all together until the end of the burnt offering. 29 And when the offering was finished, the king and all who were found with him knelt down and bowed themselves. 30 Then King Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to praise Yahweh with the words of David and Asaph the seer. So they offered praise with joy, and they bowed down and worshiped. 31 Then Hezekiah answered and said, “Now you have consecrated yourselves to Yahweh. Come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of Yahweh!” And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all who were willing in heart brought burnt offerings. 32 And the number of burnt offerings that the assembly brought was seventy cattle, one hundred rams, two hundred lambs—all these were to offer to Yahweh. 33 And the consecrated offerings of cattle were six hundred cattle and three thousand sheep. 34 But the priests were too few, and they were not able to offer all the burnt offerings, so their brothers, the Levites, strengthened them to finish the work, and until the rest of the priests consecrated themselves. (For the Levites were more conscientious to sanctify themselves than the priests.) 35 And beside the many burnt offerings was the fat of the peace offerings and the libations for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of Yahweh was established. 36 And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what God had established with the people, for the matter happened suddenly. 1 Then Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, to come to the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem to make a Passover feast to Yahweh the God of Israel. 2 Now the king and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to make the Passover feast in the second month—3 but they were not able to make it at that time, for the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient numbers, and the people had not been assembled in Jerusalem—4 and the plan seemed right in the eyes of the king and in the eyes of all the assembly. 5 So they let the decree stand, to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, to come to make a Passover feast to Yahweh the God of Israel in Jerusalem, for they had not kept it as often as prescribed. 6 And the runners went with the letter from the hand of the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah according to the command of the king, saying, “O sons of Israel, return to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may turn again to the remnant of you who escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria. 7 Do not be like your fathers and like your brothers, who acted unfaithfully before Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, so that he made them as a desolation, as you see. 8 Now, do not stiffen your neck as your fathers, but give a hand to Yahweh and come to his sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever, and serve Yahweh your God that his fierce anger may turn away from you. 9 For when you return to Yahweh, your brothers and your children will find compassion before their captors and return to this land, for Yahweh your God is gracious and compassionate, and he will not turn away his face from you if you return to him.” 10 And it happened that the runners were passing from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and up to Zebulun, but they were laughing at them and mocking them. 11 Only men from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 12 The hand of God was also upon Judah, to give them one heart to obey the command of the king and the princes concerning the word of Yahweh. 13 So many people gathered in Jerusalem to hold the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month; it was a very great assembly. 14 And they rose up and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem. And they removed all the incense altars and threw them away in the Wadi Kidron. 15 And they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were disgraced, so they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of Yahweh. 16 Then they stood at their positions according to custom, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests were sprinkling the blood from the hand of the Levites.

2 Chronicles,"17 For there were many in the assembly who did not consecrate themselves, so the Levites were over the killing of the Passover sacrifices for all who were not clean, to consecrate them to Yahweh. 18 For a majority of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves. But they ate the Passover sacrifice otherwise than prescribed, but Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, “May the good Yahweh make atonement unto 19 everyone whose heart is set to seek God, Yahweh the God of his ancestors, though not according to the cleansing for the sanctuary.” 20 And Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and he healed the people. 21 And the Israelites who were found in Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great joy. And the Levites and the priests were offering praise to Yahweh day by day, with powerful instruments to Yahweh. 22 And Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites who were skilled at service to Yahweh. So they ate the feast seven days, offering peace offerings and giving thanks to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors. 23 Then the whole assembly decided to make seven more days of feasting, so they made seven more days with joy, 24 for Hezekiah the king of Judah had provided one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for the assembly, and the princes provided one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep for the assembly. And many priests consecrated themselves. 25 And the whole assembly of Judah, and the priests and the Levites and all the assembly who had come from Israel, and the sojourners who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah, rejoiced. 26 And there was great joy in Jerusalem, for from the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there was nothing such as this in Jerusalem. 27 Then the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to his holy dwelling place in the heavens. 1 And when all this was finished, all Israel who were found in the cities of Judah went out and shattered the stone pillars, cut down the Asherahs, and destroyed the high places and the altars from all Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh to the very last one. Then all the Israelites returned, each to his own property and to their cities. 2 And Hezekiah appointed working groups of the priests and the Levites, each according to their divisions, according to the service for priests and Levites, for burnt offerings, for peace offerings, to serve, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camps of Yahweh. 3 And the gift of the king was out of his own possessions for the burnt offerings—the burnt offerings for the morning and the evening and for Sabbaths, new moon festivals, and appointed feasts, as is written in the law of Yahweh. 4 Then he said to the people, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to give a gift for the priests and the Levites, so that they might be strong in the law of Yahweh. 5 And the word spread. The Israelites gave abundantly from the firstfruits of grain, new wine, olive oil, honey, and all kinds of grains from the field. And they brought tithes of everything in abundance. 6 Then the people of Israel and Judah who were living in the cities of Judah, they also brought a tithe of cattle and sheep and a tithe of consecrated objects to Yahweh their God. And they gave heaps upon heaps. 7 In the third month the heaps began to pile up, and in the seventh month they ceased. 8 When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh and his people Israel. 9 And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. 10 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, saying, “Since the offerings began to be brought to the house of Yahweh, we have eaten and been satisfied, and have much to spare, for Yahweh has blessed his people. Now see this abundant remainder!” 11 And Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Yahweh, and they were prepared. 12 Then they brought the offerings and tithes and holy objects faithfully. And over them as leader was Conaniah the Levite. And Shimei his brother was second in rank. 13 And Jehiel, Azaziah, Nathan, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were chief officers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei, his brother, by appointment of King Hezekiah. And Azaraiah was leader of the house of God. 14 Now Kore the son of Imlah, the Levite, the gatekeeper of the east gate was over the freewill offerings of God, to give offerings to Yahweh and the most holy things. 15 And at his hand were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests and entrusted to give to their brothers by working groups, according to the eldest to the youngest, 16 besides their enrollment by genealogy, to males from three years old and above, to all who came into the house of Yahweh, as each day required for their service in their posts according to their working groups. 17 And the enrollment of the priests was according to the house of their fathers, and the Levites, from twenty years old and above, according to their posts by their working groups. 18 And they were enrolled with all their little ones, their wives, their sons, and their daughters for the whole assembly because of their faithfulness. And they sanctified themselves in holiness. 19 And for the descendants of Aaron, the priests, who were in the fields of the pasturelands of their cities, in each and every one of their cities were men who were designated by name to give shares to every male among the priests and to everyone enrolled among the Levites. 20 And Hezekiah did according to this throughout all Judah. And he did what is good and what is right and what is faithful before Yahweh his God. 21 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God or with respect to the law and the commandment to seek his God, he did with all his heart, and he prospered. 1 After these things and these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib the king of Assyria came, and he came against Judah. And he encamped against the fortified cities and planned to break them down for himself. 2 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that his face was set for battle against Jerusalem, 3 he took counsel with his commanders and his mighty warriors to block off the waters of the springs that came from outside the city, and they helped him. 4 Then many people were gathered, and they blocked off all the springs and the river that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?” 5 Then he strengthened himself and built up all the walls that were broken down, and raised towers upon them and another wall outside. And he strengthened the Millo of the city of David and made much weaponry and small shields. 6 And he appointed commanders for battle over the people and gathered them to himself into the public square of the gate of the city. And he spoke to their hearts, saying, 7 “Be strong! Be courageous! Do not fear and do not be dismayed before the king of Assyria and before all the crowd that is with him, for there are more with us than with him. 8 With him is the arm of flesh, and with us is Yahweh our God, to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people took confidence with the words of Hezekiah, king of Judah. 9 After this Sennacherib the king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (now he and all his armies with him were against Lachish) to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all of Judah that was in Jerusalem, saying, 10 “Thus says Sennacherib the king of Assyria: ‘On what are you relying that you are dwelling in siege works in Jerusalem? 11 Is not Hezekiah urging you to give you up to die by starvation and thirst, saying, “Yahweh our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria”? 12 Has not Hezekiah himself removed his high places and his altars and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying, “You must bow down before one altar and upon it you must make offerings”? 13 Do you not know what I have done, I and my ancestors, to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of all the lands at all able to save their land from my hand? 14 Who among all the gods of those nations whom my ancestors utterly destroyed was able to save his people from my hand, that your God will be able to save you from my hand? 15 So now, do not let Hezekiah deceive you. Do not let him urge you according to this. Do not put trust in him, for no god of any nation and kingdom has been able to save his people from my hand and from the hand of my ancestors. Surely then your God will not save you from my hand!’ ” 16 And still more his servants said against Yahweh God and against Hezekiah his servant. 17 And he wrote letters to treat Yahweh the God of Israel with contempt and spoke against him, saying, “As the gods of the nations of the earth who did not save their people from my hand, so likewise the God of Hezekiah will not save his people from my hand.” 18 Then they called with a great voice in Judean to the people of Jerusalem who were upon the wall to frighten them and terrify them, so that they could take the city captive. 19 And they spoke about the God of Jerusalem as about the gods of the peoples of the earth, the works of the hands of humankind. 20 Then King Hezekiah and Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, prayed concerning this. And they cried to the heavens. 21 Then Yahweh sent an angel, and he destroyed every mighty warrior of strength, commander, and officer in the camp of the king of Assyria. And he returned with shamed face to his land and went into the house of his god. And some of the offspring of his loins fell upon him there with the sword. 22 So Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria, and from the hand of all their enemies, and gave them rest all around. 23 And many brought tribute to Yahweh, to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations thereafter. 24 In those days Hezekiah fell ill unto death, and he prayed to Yahweh. And he answered him and gave him a sign. 25 But Hezekiah did not reciprocate according to the benefit placed upon him, because his heart became proud. So wrath was upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 26 But Hezekiah humbled himself with respect to the arrogance of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Yahweh did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah. 27 And Hezekiah had very much wealth and honor, and he made storehouses for himself for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, small shields, and all sorts of desirable objects; 28 and storage buildings for the yield of grain, new wine, and olive oil; and animal stalls for all kinds of animals, and animals and herds for animal stalls. 29 And he made cities for himself, and livestock of sheep and abundant cattle, for God had given to him very abundant possessions. 30 And this same Hezekiah blocked off the flow of the waters of the upper Gihon, and directed them down the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. 31 And thus in the matter of the envoys of the commanders of Babylon who had been sent to him to seek the sign that had happened in the land, God forsook him, to test him and to know all that was in his heart. 32 Now the remainder of the words of Hezekiah and his loyal love, behold, they are written in the visions of Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, upon the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel. 33 And Hezekiah slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the upper part of the burial sites of the descendants of David. And all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son became king in his place.

2 Chronicles,"1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. 2 And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh according to the detestable things of the nations whom Yahweh drove out before the Israelites. 3 And he rebuilt the high places that Hezekiah his father broke down, and he set up altars for the Baals, made Asherahs, and bowed down to the host of heaven and served them. 4 And he built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh had said, “In Jerusalem my name shall be forever.” 5 And he built altars to all the host of heaven in the two courtyards of the house of Yahweh. 6 And he himself burned his sons in the fire in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom. And he practiced sorcery and divination, and he engaged in witchcraft and dealt with mediums and spiritists. And he did much evil in the eyes of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger. 7 And he placed the carved image of the idol that he had made in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever. 8 And I will never remove the foot of Israel from upon the land that I appointed to your ancestors, if only you will take care to do all that I have commanded them, all the law, the regulations, and the judgments by the hand of Moses.” 9 And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do evil more than the nations that Yahweh destroyed before the Israelites. 10 And Yahweh spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they would not listen. 11 So Yahweh brought the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria upon them, and they took Manasseh captive with hooks, and they bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon. 12 And when he was in distress he entreated Yahweh his God and greatly humbled himself before the God of his ancestors 13 and prayed to him. And God responded to him and heard his plea and let him return to Jerusalem to his kingdom. And Manasseh knew that Yahweh was God. 14 Then afterward he built an outer wall for the city of David west of the Gihon in the valley, and for the entrance into the Gate of the Fishes. And it encircled the Ophel and raised it very high. Then he placed strong commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah. 15 And he removed the foreign gods and the carved image from the house of Yahweh and all the altars which he built on the mountain of the house of Yahweh and in Jerusalem, and he threw them outside the city. 16 And he restored the altar of Yahweh and offered sacrifices of peace offerings and thank offerings upon it. And he commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel. 17 Nevertheless, the people offered at the high places, but only to Yahweh their God. 18 Now the remainder of the words of Manasseh and his prayer to his God and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are in the words of the kings of Israel. 19 And his prayer, and how he responded to him, all his sin and his unfaithful acts, and the places where he built the high places and set up Asherahs and idols before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the words of the seers. 20 And Manasseh slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in his house. And Amon his son became king in his place. 21 Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 22 And he did what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh as Manasseh his father had done. And Amon sacrificed to all the idols that Manasseh his father had made, and he served them. 23 And he did not humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father humbled himself, but Amon himself multiplied his guilt. 24 And his servants conspired against him and killed him in his house. 25 But the people of the land struck down all who conspired against King Amon. And the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.

2 Chronicles,"1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. 2 And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and he walked in the ways of David his ancestor and did not deviate to the right or to the left. 3 In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a boy, he began to seek the God of David his ancestor. And in the twelfth year he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherahs, the idols, and the images. 4 And he destroyed before him the altars for the Baals, and he cut down the incense stands above them. And the Asherahs, the idols, and the images he smashed. And he ground them to powder and sprinkled the dust over the burial sites of those who sacrificed to them. 5 And he burned the bones of the priests on the altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. 6 And in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, in their ruins all around, 7 he broke down the altars and the Asherahs and crushed the idols, grinding them to dust, and he cut down all the incense stands in all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem. 8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign after he purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the commander of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of Yahweh his God. 9 And they came to Hilkiah the high priest and gave the money that was brought for the house of God, which the Levites, the guardians of the threshold, had gathered from the hand of Manasseh, Ephraim, and from the whole remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 10 And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen who were appointed in the house of Yahweh, and they in turn gave it to those doing the work who were at work in the house of Yahweh, to repair and restore the house. 11 And they dispensed it to the skilled craftsmen and the builders to buy stone for hewing and timber for the seams and for binding the houses that the kings of Judah had destroyed. 12 And the men did the work faithfully. Over them as supervisors were appointed Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites from the Merarites, and Zechariah and Meshullam from the Kohathites. And other Levites, all who were skilled in instruments of song, 13 were over the porters and were directing all who worked on each task. And some of the Levites were scribes, officials, and gatekeepers. 14 And when they brought out the money that had been brought to the house of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priest found a scroll of the law of Yahweh by the hand of Moses. 15 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found a scroll of the law in the house of Yahweh!” Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan. 16 And Shaphan brought the scroll to the king and also informed the king, saying, “All that was put into the hand of your servants they are doing. 17 They have dispensed the money which was found in the house of Yahweh and have put it into the hand of the overseers and those doing the work.” 18 Then Shaphan the scribe reported to the king, “Hilkiah the priest gave to me a scroll.” Then Shaphan read from it before the king. 19 And when the king heard the words of the law, he tore his garments, 20 and the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the king, saying, 21 “Go! Seek Yahweh on my behalf and on behalf of those remaining in Israel and Judah concerning the words of the scroll that was found, for the anger of Yahweh that was poured out on us is great, because our ancestors have not kept the word of Yahweh, to do all that is written in this scroll.” 22 Then Hilkiah and those whom the king had sent went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, son of Tikvath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the garments. (Now she was living in Jerusalem in the second district.) And they spoke to her concerning this. 23 And she said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Say to the man who sent you all to me: 24 “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Behold, I am bringing disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants—all the curses written in the scroll that were read before the king of Judah—25 because they have abandoned me and burned incense to other gods so as to provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands. And my wrath will be poured out on this place and it will not be quenched.’ 26 But to the king of Judah who sent you to seek Yahweh, thus shall you say to him: ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: As for the words which you heard, 27 because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and against its inhabitants and you humbled yourself before me and tore your garments and wept before me, now I also have heard,’ declares Yahweh. 28 ‘Behold, I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see any of the disaster that I am bringing upon this place and upon its inhabitants.’ ” ’ ” And they brought back word to the king. 29 Then the king sent word, and he gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 30 And the king went up to the house of Yahweh with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with the priests and the Levites—all the people from great to small—and they read in their ears all the words of the scroll of the covenant that was found in the house of Yahweh. 31 And the king stood at his position. And he made the covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh and to keep his commands and statutes and regulations with all his heart and with all his soul, to do the words of the covenant that were written on this scroll. 32 Then he obligated all who were found in Jerusalem and in Benjamin, that the inhabitants of Jerusalem would do according to the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors. 33 And Josiah removed all the detestable things from the whole land that belonged to the Israelites and obligated all who were found in Israel to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they did not turn aside from following Yahweh, the God of their ancestors. 1 Josiah kept the Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem. And they slaughtered the Passover sacrifice on the fourteenth day of the first month. 2 And he set the priests at their posts and encouraged them in the service of the house of Yahweh. 3 And he said to the Levites who were teaching all Israel, who were sanctified to Yahweh, “Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. There is no need to carry it on your shoulders. Now serve Yahweh your God and his people Israel. 4 And prepare yourselves according to your families, according to your working groups, according to the decree of David king of Israel and according to the decree of Solomon his son. 5 And stand in the sanctuary according to the clans of your families for your brothers, the lay people, and a part of the family of the Levites. 6 And slaughter the Passover lamb and consecrate yourself and prepare for your brothers to do according to the word of Yahweh by the hand of Moses. 7 Then Josiah provided for the lay people sheep, lambs, and young goats, all for the Passover for all who were found there, to the sum of thirty thousand, along with three thousand bulls. These were the possession of the king. 8 And his officials contributed a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, commanders of the house of God, gave to the priests two thousand six hundred Passover lambs and three hundred bulls. 9 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jehozabad, commanders of the Levites, contributed to the Levites five thousand Passover lambs and five hundred bulls. 10 And when the work had been completed, the priests stood at their positions and the Levites in their working groups according to the command of the king. 11 And they slaughtered the Passover lamb, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hand, and the Levites flayed the sacrifices. 12 And they set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the clans of the families for the lay people, to offer to Yahweh according to what is written in the scroll of Moses. And thus they did with the bulls. 13 Then they roasted the Passover lamb in the fire according to the ordinance. And they boiled the holy offerings in pots, in kettles, and in dishes and brought it quickly to all the lay people. 14 And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, since the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night. So the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron. 15 And the singers, the descendants of Asaph, were at their stations according to the decree of David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, the seer of the king. And the gatekeepers were at each gate. They did not need to depart from their service, for their brothers the Levites had made preparations for them. 16 So all the service of Yahweh was prepared on that day to keep the Passover and to sacrifice burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh, according to the command of King Josiah. 17 And the Israelites who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days. 18 And there was no Passover like it kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. And none of the kings of Israel kept a Passover like that which Josiah and the priests and the Levites, and all of Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, kept. 19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept. 20 After all of this that Josiah had prepared for the temple, Neco the king of Egypt went up to make war at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went up to meet him. 21 And he sent messengers to him, saying, “What is there between us, O king of Judah? I am not against you yourself this day, but against the house making war against me. And God has commanded me to make haste. Stop opposing God, who is with me that he will not destroy you.” 22 But Josiah did not turn his face from him, but he disguised himself to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and he went out to fight in the plain of Megiddo. 23 And the archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am badly wounded.” 24 So his servants took him out of the chariot and transported him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died and was buried in the burial sites of his ancestors. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned over Josiah. 25 And Jeremiah uttered a lament for Josiah, and all the male and female singers have spoken in their laments about Josiah to this day. And they made them a requirement in Israel, and behold, they are written in the laments. 26 Now the remainder of the words of Josiah and his loyal love for what is written in the law of Yahweh 27 and his words, from the first to the last, behold, they are written in the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah. 1 And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and made him king in place of his father in Jerusalem. 2 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 3 Then the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and laid a tribute upon the land of one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. 4 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and he changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Jehoahaz his brother and brought him to Egypt. 5 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh his God. 6 Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon went up against him, and he bound him with bronze fetters to bring him to Babylon. 7 And Nebuchadnezzar brought to Babylon the objects of the house of Yahweh and put them into the temple in Babylon. 8 Now the remainder of the words of Jehoiakim and the detestable things that he did and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place. 9 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. 10 And at the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with objects of the treasure of the house of Yahweh. And he made Zedekiah his brother king in Judah and Jerusalem. 11 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. 12 And he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh his God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet who spoke for Yahweh. 13 And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. He stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel. 14 All the leaders of the priests and the people likewise increased in unfaithfulness according to all the detestable things of the nations. And they polluted the house of Yahweh that he had consecrated in Jerusalem. 15 And Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, had repeatedly and persistently sent to them by the hand of his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place. 16 But they were mocking the messengers of God and despising his words and scoffing at his prophets until the wrath of Yahweh rose against his people until there was no remedy. 17 Therefore he brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, and he killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary. He showed no mercy on a young man, a virgin, the elderly, or decrepit. He delivered all into his hand. 18 And all the vessels of the house of God, the great and the small, the storehouses of the house of Yahweh, and the storehouses of the king and his princes, these all he brought to Babylon. 19 And they burned the house of God. And they shattered the walls of Jerusalem and burned all its citadels with fire and destroyed all the vessels of its treasuries. 20 And he took those who escaped the sword to Babylon. And they became servants to him and to his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia, 21 to fulfill the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land has enjoyed its Sabbaths. All the days of desolation it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years. 22 And in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also in writing, saying: 23 “Thus says Cyrus, king of Persia: ‘Yahweh the God of heaven has given to me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has appointed me to build a house for him at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you from all his people, may Yahweh his God go up with him.’ ” ",2 Chronicles 34-36,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/2-chronicles-34-36-20049/direct-download/tbd20080218.mp3

Romans,"21 For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their reasoning, and their senseless hearts were darkened. 22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools, 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God with the likeness of an image of mortal human beings and birds and quadrupeds and reptiles. 24 Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to immorality, that their bodies would be dishonored among themselves, 25 who exchanged the truth of God with a lie, and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed for eternity. Amen. 26 Because of this, God gave them over to degrading passions, for their females exchanged the natural relations for those contrary to nature, 27 and likewise also the males, abandoning the natural relations with the female, were inflamed in their desire toward one another, males with males committing the shameless deed, and receiving in themselves the penalty that was necessary for their error. 28 And just as they did not see fit to recognize God, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do the things that are not proper, 29 being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greediness, malice, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malevolence. They are gossipers, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, contrivers of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 senseless, faithless, unfeeling, unmerciful, 32 who, although they know the requirements of God, that those who do such things are worthy of death, not only do they do the same things, but also they approve of those who do them.

Romans,"1 Therefore you are without excuse, O man, every one of you who passes judgment. For in that which you pass judgment on someone else, you condemn yourself, for you who are passing judgment are doing the same things. 2 Now we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things. 3 But do you think this, O man who passes judgment on those who do such things, and who does the same things, that you will escape the judgment of God? 4 Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance? 5 But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God, 6 who will reward each one according to his works: 7 to those who, by perseverance in good work, seek glory and honor and immortality, eternal life, 8 but to those who act from selfish ambition and who disobey the truth, but who obey unrighteousness, wrath and anger. 9 There will be affliction and distress for every human being who does evil, of the Jew first and of the Greek, 10 but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and to the Greek. 11 For there is no partiality with God. 12 For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. 13 For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be declared righteous. 14 For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, although they do not have the law, are a law to themselves, 15 who show the work of the law written on their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts one after another accusing or even defending them 16 on the day when God judges the secret things of people, according to my gospel, through Christ Jesus. 17 But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God 18 and know his will and approve the things that are superior, because you are instructed by the law, 19 and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those in darkness, 20 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth in the law. 21 Therefore, the one who teaches someone else, do you not teach yourself?

The one who abhors idols, do you rob temples? 23 Who boast in the law, by the transgression of the law you dishonor God! 24 For just as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.” 25 For circumcision is of value if you do the law, but if you should be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. 26 Therefore, if the uncircumcised person follows the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision? 27 And the uncircumcised person by nature who carries out the law will judge you who, though provided with the precise written code and circumcision are a transgressor of the law. 28 For the Jew is not one outwardly, nor is circumcision outwardly, in the flesh. 29 But the Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter, whose praise is not from people but from God. 1 Therefore, what is the advantage of the Jew, or what is the use of circumcision? 2 Much in every way. For first, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God. 3 What is the result if some refused to believe? Their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, will it? 4 May it never be! But let God be true but every human being a liar, just as it is written, “In order that you may be justified in your words, and may prevail when you are judged.” 5 But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say?

For we have already charged both Jews and Greeks are all under sin, 10 just as it is written, “There is no one righteous, not even one; 11 there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. 12 All have turned aside together; they have become worthless; There is no one who practices kindness; there is not even one. 13 Their throat is an opened grave; they deceive with their tongues; the venom of asps is under their lips, 14 whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. 15 Their feet are swift to shed blood; 16 destruction and distress are in their paths, 17 and they have not known the way of peace. 18 The fear of God is not before their eyes.” 19 Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those under the law, in order that every mouth may be closed and the whole world may become accountable to God. 20 For by the works of the law no person will be declared righteous before him, for through the law comes knowledge of sin. 21 But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified about by the law and the prophets—22 that is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.

Romans,"22 that is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. For there is no distinction, 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 being justified as a gift by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, 25 whom God made publicly available as the mercy seat through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness, because of the passing over of previously committed sins, 26 in the forbearance of God, for the demonstration of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just and the one who justifies the person by faith in Jesus. 27 Therefore, where is boasting? It has been excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith. 28 For we consider a person to be justified by faith apart from the works of the law. 29 Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, also of the Gentiles, 30 since God is one, who will justify those who are circumcised by faith and those who are uncircumcised through faith. 31 Therefore, do we nullify the law through faith? May it never be! But we uphold the law. ",Romans 3:22-31,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/romans-322-31-14257/direct-download/tbd20071123.mp3
Romans,"1 What then shall we say that Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh, has found? 2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 3 For what does the scripture say? “And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness.” 4 Now to the one who works, his pay is not credited according to grace, but according to his due. 5 But to the one who does not work, but who believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited for righteousness, 6 just as David also speaks about the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: 7 “Blessed are they whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, and whose sins are covered over. 8 Blessed is the person against whom the Lord will never count sin.” 9 Therefore, is this blessing for those who are circumcised, or also for those who are uncircumcised? For we say, “Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness.” 10 How then was it credited? While he was circumcised or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised but while uncircumcised! 11 And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness by faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he could be the father of all who believe although they are uncircumcised, so that righteousness could be credited to them, 12 and the father of those who are circumcised to those who are not only from the circumcision, but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised. 13 For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants, that he would be heir of the world, was not through the law, but through the righteousness by faith. 14 For if those of the law are heirs, faith is rendered void and the promise is nullified. 15 For the law produces wrath, but where there is no law, neither is there transgression. 16 Because of this, it is by faith, in order that it may be according to grace, so that the promise may be secure to all the descendants, not only to those of the law, but also to those of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all 17 (just as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”) before God, in whom he believed, the one who makes the dead alive and who calls the things that are not as though they are, 18 who against hope believed in hope, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was said, “so will your descendants be.” 19 And not being weak in faith, he considered his own body as good as dead, because he was approximately a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb. 20 And he did not waver in unbelief at the promise of God, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God 21 and being fully convinced that what he had promised, he was also able to do. 22 Therefore it was credited to him for righteousness. 23 But it was not written for the sake of him alone that it was credited to him, 24 but also for the sake of us to whom it is going to be credited, to those who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, 25 who was handed over on account of our trespasses, and was raised up in the interest of our justification.

Romans,"1 Therefore, because we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in the hope of the glory of God. 3 And not only this, but we also boast in our afflictions, because we know that affliction produces patient endurance, 4 and patient endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope, 5 and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us. 6 For while we were still helpless, yet at the proper time Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For only rarely will someone die on behalf of a righteous person (for on behalf of a good person possibly someone might even dare to die), 8 but God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Therefore, by much more, because we have been declared righteous now by his blood, we will be saved through him from the wrath.

Romans,"9 Therefore, by much more, because we have been declared righteous now by his blood, we will be saved through him from the wrath. 10 For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, by much more, having been reconciled, we will be saved by his life. 11 And not only this, but also we are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. 12 Because of this, just as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death spread to all people because all sinned. 13 For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not charged to one’s account when there is no law. 14 But death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of the one who is to come. 15 But the gift is not like the trespass, for if by the trespass of the one, the many died, by much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, multiply to the many. 16 And the gift is not as through the one who sinned, for on the one hand, judgment from the one sin led to condemnation, but the gift, from many trespasses, led to justification. 17 For if by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through the one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ. 18 Consequently therefore, as through one trespass came condemnation to all people, so also through one righteous deed came justification of life to all people. 19 For just as through the disobedience of the one man, the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one, the many will be made righteous. 20 Now the law came in as a side issue, in order that the trespass could increase, but where sin increased, grace was present in greater abundance, 21 so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Romans,"1 What therefore shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, in order that grace may increase? 2 May it never be! How can we who died to sin still live in it? 3 Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we may live a new way of life. 5 For if we have become identified with him in the likeness of his death, certainly also we will be identified with him in the likeness of his resurrection, 6 knowing this, that our old man was crucified together with him, in order that the body of sin may be done away with, that we may no longer be enslaved to sin. 7 For the one who has died has been freed from sin. 8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him, 9 knowing that Christ, because he has been raised from the dead, is going to die no more, death no longer being master over him. 10 For that death he died, he died to sin once and never again, but that life he lives, he lives to God. 11 So also you, consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. 12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that you obey its desires, 13 and do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness. 14 For sin will not be master over you, because you are not under law, but under grace.

For just as you presented your members as slaves to immorality and lawlessness, leading to lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, leading to sanctification. 20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with respect to righteousness. 21 Therefore what sort of fruit did you have then, about which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. 22 But now, having been set free from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit leading to sanctification, and its end is eternal life. 23 For the compensation due sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Romans,"1 Or do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law is master of a person for as long a time as he lives? 2 For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of the husband. 3 Therefore as a result, if she belongs to another man while her husband is living, she will be called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress if she belongs to another man. 4 So then, my brothers, you also were brought to death with respect to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to the one who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God. 5 For when we were in the flesh, sinful desires were working through the law in our members, to bear fruit for death. 6 But now we have been released from the law, because we have died to that by which we were bound, so that we may serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter of the law.

Romans,"7 What then shall we say? Is the law sin? May it never be! But I would not have known sin except through the law, for I would not have known covetousness if the law had not said, “Do not covet.” 8 But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin is dead. 9 And I was alive once, apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life 10 and I died, and this commandment which was to lead to life was found with respect to me to lead to death. 11 For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. 12 So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. 13 Therefore, did that which is good become death to me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be recognized as sin, producing death through what is good for me, in order that sin might become sinful to an extraordinary degree through the commandment. 14 For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold into slavery to sin. 15 For what I am doing I do not understand, because what I want to do, this I do not practice, but what I hate, this I do. 16 But if what I do not want to do, this I do, I agree with the law that it is good. 17 But now I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that lives in me. 18 For I know that good does not live in me, that is, in my flesh. For the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. 19 For the good that I want to do, I do not do, but the evil that I do not want to do, this I do. 20 But if what I do not want to do, this I am doing, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that lives in me. 21 Consequently, I find the principle with me, the one who wants to do good, that evil is present with me. 22 For I joyfully agree with the law of God in my inner person, 23 but I observe another law in my members, at war with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that exists in my members. 24 Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!

By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, 4 in order that the requirement of the law would be fulfilled in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. 5 For those who are living according to the flesh are intent on the things of the flesh, but those who are living according to the Spirit are intent on the things of the Spirit. 6 For the mindset of the flesh is death, but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace, 7 because the mindset of the flesh is enmity toward God, for it is not subjected to the law of God, for it is not able to do so, 8 and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God.

Romans,"28 And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose, 29 because those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brothers. 30 And those whom he predestined, these he also called, and those whom he called, these he also justified, and those whom he justified, these he also glorified. 31 What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32 Indeed, he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also, together with him, freely give us all things? 33 Who will bring charges against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies. 34 Who is the one who condemns? Christ is the one who died, and more than that, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us. 35 Who will separate us from the love of Christ?

Amen. 6 But it is not as if the word of God had failed. For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel, 7 nor are they all children because they are descendants of Abraham, but “In Isaac will your descendants be named.” 8 That is, it is not the children by human descent who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as descendants. 9 For the statement of the promise is this: “At this time I will return and Sarah will have a son.” 10 And not only this, but also when Rebecca conceived children by one man, Isaac our father—11 for although they had not yet been born, or done anything good or evil, in order that the purpose of God according to election might remain, 12 not by works but by the one who calls—it was said to her, “The older will serve the younger,” 13 just as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” 14 What then shall we say? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be! 15 For to Moses he says, “I will have mercy on whomever I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I have compassion.” 16 Consequently therefore, it does not depend on the one who wills or on the one who runs, but on God who shows mercy. 17 For the scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very reason I have raised you up, so that I may demonstrate my power in you, and so that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” 18 Consequently therefore, he has mercy on whomever he wishes, and he hardens whomever he wishes. 19 Therefore you will say to me, “Why then does he still find fault? For who has resisted his will? 20 On the contrary, O man, who are you who answers back to God? Will what is molded say to the one who molded it, “Why did you make me like this”? 21 Or does the potter not have authority over the clay, to make from the same lump a vessel that is for honorable use and one that is for ordinary use? 22 And what if God, wanting to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction? 23 And he did so in order that he could make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory, 24 us whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?

Romans,"25 As he also says in Hosea, “I will call those who were not my people, ‘My people,’ and those who were not loved, ‘Loved.’ 26 And it will be in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’ ” 27 And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, “Even if the number of the sons of Israel is like the sand of the sea, the remnant will be saved, 28 for the Lord will execute his sentence thoroughly and decisively upon the earth.” 29 And just as Isaiah foretold, “If the Lord of hosts had not left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom and would have resembled Gomorrah.” 30 What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness—even the righteousness that is by faith. 31 But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, did not attain to the law. 32 Why that? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if by works. They stumbled over the stone that causes people to stumble, 33 just as it is written, “Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble, and a rock that causes them to fall, and the one who believes in him will not be put to shame.” 1 Brothers, the desire of my heart and my prayer to God on behalf of them is for their salvation. 2 For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. 3 For ignoring the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. 5 For Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: “The person who does this will live by it.” 6 But the righteousness from faith speaks like this: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ down), ",Romans 9:25-10:6,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/romans-925-106-14271/direct-download/tbd20071213.mp3
Romans,"7 or “Who will descend into the abyss?” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). 8 But what does it say? “The word is near to you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim), 9 that if you confess with your mouth “Jesus is Lord” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses, resulting in salvation. 11 For the scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, who is rich to all who call upon him. 13 For “everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.” 14 How then will they call upon him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in him about whom they have not heard? And how will they hear about him without one who preaches to them? 15 And how will they preach, unless they are sent? Just as it is written, “How timely are the feet of those who bring good news of good things.” 16 But not all have obeyed the good news, for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?” 17 Consequently, faith comes by hearing, and hearing through the word about Christ. 18 But I say, they have not heard, have they? On the contrary, “Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the inhabited world.” 19 But I say, Israel did not know, did they? First, Moses says, “I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation; by a senseless nation I will provoke you to anger.” 20 And Isaiah is very bold and says, “I was found by those who did not seek me; I became known to those who did not ask for me.” 21 But about Israel he says, “The whole day long I held out my hands to a disobedient and resistant people.” 1 Therefore I say, God has not rejected his people, has he? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, from the descendants of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 2 God has not rejected his people, whom he foreknew! Or do you not know, in the passage about Elijah, what the scripture says—how he appeals to God against Israel? 3 “Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life!” 4 But what does the divine response say to him? “I have left for myself seven thousand people who have not bent the knee to Baal.” 5 So in this way also at the present time, there is a remnant selected by grace. 6 But if by grace, it is no longer by works, for otherwise grace would no longer be grace. 7 What then? What Israel was searching for, this it did not obtain. But the elect obtained it, and the rest were hardened, 8 just as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, until this very day.” 9 And David says, “Let their table become a snare and a trap, and a cause for stumbling and a retribution to them; 10 let their eyes be darkened so that they do not see, and cause their backs to bend continually.” ",Romans 10:7-11:10,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/romans-107-1110-14272/direct-download/tbd20071214.mp3
Romans,"11 I say then, they did not stumble so that they fell, did they? May it never be! But by their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles, in order to provoke them to jealousy. 12 And if their trespass means riches for the world and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness mean? 13 Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Therefore, inasmuch as I am apostle to the Gentiles, I promote my ministry, 14 if somehow I may provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them. 15 For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean except life from the dead? 16 Now if the first fruits are holy, so also is the whole batch of dough, and if the root is holy, so also are the branches. 17 Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although you were a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the root of the olive tree’s richness, 18 do not boast against the branches. But if you boast against them, you do not support the root, but the root supports you. 19 Then you will say, “Branches were broken off in order that I could be grafted in.” 20 Well said! They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand firm because of faith. Do not think arrogant thoughts, but be afraid. 21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. 22 See, then, the kindness and severity of God: severity upon those who have fallen, but upon you the kindness of God—if you continue in his kindness, for otherwise you also will be cut off. 23 And those also, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, because God is able to graft them in again. 24 For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree? 25 For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you will not be wise in your own sight, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in, ",Romans 11:11-25,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/romans-1111-25-14273/direct-download/tbd20071217.mp3
Romans,"26 and so all Israel will be saved, just as it is written, “The deliverer will come out of Zion; he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob. 27 And this is the covenant from me with them when I take away their sins.” 28 With respect to the gospel, they are enemies for your sake, but with respect to election, they are dearly loved for the sake of the fathers. 29 For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. 30 For just as you formerly were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of the disobedience of these, 31 so also these have now been disobedient for your mercy, in order that they also may now be shown mercy. 32 For God confined them all in disobedience, in order that he could have mercy on them all. 33 Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how incomprehensible are his ways! 34 “For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? 35 Or who has given in advance to him, and it will be paid back to him?” 36 For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory for eternity!

Romans,"1 Therefore I exhort you, brothers, through the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. 2 And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, so that you may approve what is the good and well-pleasing and perfect will of God. 3 For by the grace given to me I say to everyone who is among you not to think more highly of yourself than what one ought to think, but to think sensibly, as God has apportioned a measure of faith to each one. 4 For just as in one body we have many members, but all the members do not have the same function, 5 in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another, 6 but having different gifts according to the grace given to us: if it is prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith; 7 if it is service, by service; if it is one who teaches, by teaching; 8 if it is one who exhorts, by exhortation; one who gives, with sincerity; one who leads, with diligence; one who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. 9 Love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; be attached to what is good, 10 being devoted to one another in brotherly love, esteeming one another more highly in honor, 11 not lagging in diligence, being enthusiastic in spirit, serving the Lord, ",Romans 12:1-11,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/romans-121-11-14275/direct-download/tbd20071219.mp3
Romans,"12 rejoicing in hope, enduring in affliction, being devoted to prayer, 13 contributing to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality. 14 Bless those who persecute, bless and do not curse them. 15 Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep. 16 Think the same thing toward one another; do not think arrogantly, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own sight. 17 Pay back no one evil for evil. Take thought for what is good in the sight of all people. 18 If it is possible on your part, be at peace with all people. 19 Do not take revenge yourselves, dear friends, but give place to God’s wrath, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay,” says the Lord. 20 But “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by doing this, you will heap up coals of fire upon his head.” 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. 1 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except by God, and those that exist are put in place by God.

Romans,"1 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except by God, and those that exist are put in place by God. 2 So then, the one who resists authority resists the ordinance which is from God, and those who resist will receive condemnation on themselves. 3 For rulers are not a cause of terror for a good deed, but for bad conduct. So do you want not to be afraid of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from it, 4 for it is God’s servant to you for what is good. But if you do what is bad, be afraid, because it does not bear the sword to no purpose. For it is God’s servant, the one who avenges for punishment on the one who does what is bad. 5 Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience. 6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are servants of God, busily engaged in this very thing. 7 Pay to everyone what is owed: pay taxes to whom taxes are due; pay customs duties to whom customs duties are due; pay respect to whom respect is due; pay honor to whom honor is due. 8 Owe nothing to anyone, except to love one another, for the one who loves someone else has fulfilled the law. 9 For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, you shall not commit murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet,” and if there is any other commandment, are summed up in this statement: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” 10 Love does not commit evil against a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. 11 And do this because you know the time, that it is already the hour for you to wake up from sleep. For our salvation is nearer now than when we believed. 12 The night is far gone, and the day has drawn near. Therefore let us throw off the deeds of darkness and put on the weapons of light. 13 Let us live decently, as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and licentiousness, not in strife and jealousy. 14 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not make provision for the desires of the flesh.

Romans,"1 Now receive the one who is weak in faith, but not for quarrels about opinions. 2 One believes he may eat all things, but the one who is weak eats only vegetables. 3 The one who eats must not despise the one who does not eat, and the one who does not eat must not judge the one who eats, because God has accepted him. 4 Who are you, who passes judgment on the domestic slave belonging to someone else? To his own master he stands or falls, and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. 5 One person prefers one day over another day, and another person regards every day alike.

Romans,"5 One person prefers one day over another day, and another person regards every day alike. Each one must be fully convinced in his own mind. 6 The one who is intent on the day is intent on it for the Lord, and the one who eats eats for the Lord, because he is thankful to God, and the one who does not eat does not eat for the Lord, and he is thankful to God. 7 For none of us lives for himself and none dies for himself. 8 For if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord’s. 9 For Christ died and became alive again for this reason, in order that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living. 10 But why do you judge your brother? Or also, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. 11 For it is written, “As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will praise God.” 12 So each one of us will give an account concerning himself. 13 Therefore, let us no longer pass judgment on one another, but rather decide this: not to place a cause for stumbling or a temptation before a brother. 14 I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean of itself, except to the one who considers something to be unclean; to that person it is unclean. 15 For if because of food, your brother is grieved, you are no longer living according to love. Do not destroy by your food that person for whom Christ died. 16 Therefore do not let your good be slandered. 17 For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

Romans,"17 For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 For the one who serves Christ in this way is well-pleasing to God and approved by people. 19 So then, let us pursue what promotes peace and what edifies one another. 20 Do not destroy the work of God on account of food. All things are clean, but it is wrong for the person who eats and stumbles in the process. 21 It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything by which your brother stumbles or is offended or is weakened. 22 The faith that you have, have with respect to yourself before God. Blessed is the one who does not pass judgment on himself by what he approves. 23 But the one who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not do so from faith, and everything that is not from faith is sin. 1 But we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 2 Let each one of us please his neighbor for his good, for the purpose of edification. 3 For even Christ did not please himself, but just as it is written, “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.” ",Romans 14:17-15:3,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/romans-1417-153-20016/direct-download/tbd20080102.mp3
Romans,"4 For whatever was written beforehand was written for our instruction, in order that through patient endurance and through the encouragement of the scriptures we may have hope. 5 Now may the God of patient endurance and of encouragement grant you to be in agreement with one another, in accordance with Christ Jesus, 6 so that with one mind you may glorify with one mouth the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 7 Therefore accept one another, just as Christ also has accepted you, to the glory of God. 8 For I say, Christ has become a servant of the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God, in order to confirm the promises to the fathers, 9 and that the Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy, just as it is written, “Because of this, I will praise you among the Gentiles, and I will sing praise to your name.” 10 And again it says, “Rejoice, Gentiles, with his people.” 11 And again, “Praise the Lord, all the Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him.” 12 And again Isaiah says, “The root of Jesse will come, even the one who rises to rule over the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles will put their hope.” 13 Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. 14 Now I myself also am convinced about you, my brothers, that you yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to instruct one another. 15 But I have written to you more boldly on some points, so as to remind you again because of the grace that has been given to me by God, 16 with the result that I am a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving the gospel of God as a priest, in order that the offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

1 Kings,"1 Now King David had become old, advanced in years, and they covered him with garments, but he was not warm. 2 His servants said to him, “Let them search for a young virgin for my lord the king, and let her stand before the king. Let her be of use for him, and let her lie in your lap that my lord the king may be warm.” 3 So they sought a beautiful young woman in all the territory of Israel, and they found Abishag the Shunnamite and brought her to the king. 4 Now the young woman was very beautiful; she was of use for the king, and she served him, but the king did not have sexual relations with her. 5 Now Adonijah the son of Haggith was exalting himself, saying, “I will be king,” so he prepared for himself a chariot and horsemen and fifty men running before him. 6 His father did not rebuke him at any time by saying, “Why did you do so?” Now he was also very handsome of appearance; she had borne him after Absalom. 7 He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they supported Adonijah. 8 But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty warriors were David’s; they were not with Adonijah. 9 And Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened animals near the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel. He invited all of his brothers, the sons of the king, and all the men of Judah, the servants of the king. 10 But he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty warriors or Solomon his brother. 11 Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, but our lord David does not know? 12 So then, come, let me advise you please, that you may save your life and the life of your son, Solomon. 13 Come, go to King David and say to him, ‘Have you not, my lord the king, sworn to your servant, “Surely Solomon your son shall become king after me. And he will sit on my throne”? But why is Adonijah king?’ 14 While you are still there speaking with the king, I will enter after you, and I will confirm your words.” 15 So Bathsheba went to the king in the private room. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunnamite was attending the king. 16 Bathsheba knelt and bowed down before the king, and the king asked, “What do you want?” 17 She said to him, “My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God to your servant, ‘Solomon your son surely shall become king after me, and he will sit upon my throne!’ 18 But now, look! Adonijah has become king! And now, my lord the king, you do not know! 19 He has sacrificed oxen and sheep and fattened animals in abundance, and he has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, Joab the commander of the army, but Solomon your servant he did not invite. 20 But as for you, my lord the king, the eyes of all of Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 21 It shall be that when my lord the king sleeps with his ancestors, I and my son Solomon will be considered as sinners.” 22 While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. 23 They told the king, “Nathan the prophet is here.” He came into the presence of the king and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. 24 Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall be king after me and he shall sit on my throne’? 25 “For he went down today and sacrificed oxen, sheep, and fattened animals in abundance. He invited all the sons of the king, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest, and look, they are eating and drinking before him. They have also said, “Long live King Adonijah! 26 But me, your servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Solomon your servant he did not invite. 27 If it was from my lord the king that this thing has happened, then all is well, but if not, you must let your servants know who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.” 28 Then King David answered and said, “Summon Bathsheba for me.” Then she came before the king and stood in his presence. 29 Then the king swore and said, “As Yahweh lives, who has saved my life from all trouble, 30 surely as I swore to you by Yahweh the God of Israel, saying, ‘Solomon your son shall surely be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ surely I shall do so this very day.” 31 Then Bathsheba knelt with her face to the ground and did obeisance to the king, and she said, “May my lord, King David, live forever.” 32 Then King David said, “Summon Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,” and they came before the king. 33 The king said to them, “Take with you all the servants of your lord, and let them make Solomon my son ride on my mule, and bring him down to Gihon. 34 Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel. Blow on the trumpet and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ 35 Then you shall go up after him, and let him come and sit on my throne; he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be leader over Israel and Judah.” 36 Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, “Amen! So may Yahweh, the God of my lord the king, confirm it! 37 As Yahweh was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.” 38 Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites went down, and they let Solomon ride on the mule of King David, and they brought him to Gihon. 39 Then Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent, and he anointed Solomon. They blew on the trumpet, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!” 40 All the people went up after him, and the people were playing on the flutes and rejoicing with great joy, and the earth shook with their noise. 41 And Adonijah and all the invited guests who were with him heard it. Now they were finished eating when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet and said, “Why is there such a noise in the city?” 42 While he was still speaking, suddenly Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. Adonijah said, “Come, for you are a man of valor, and you bring good news.” 43 Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, “But our lord King David has made Solomon king! 44 He sent Zadok the priest with the king, and Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites, and the Pelethites; they made him ride on the king’s mule. 45 Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him as king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there rejoicing. The city has gone wild; this is the sound which you heard. 46 And also, Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom! 47 The servants of the king also came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘Your God has made the name of Solomon better than your name and his throne greater than your throne!’ So the king worshiped on the bed. 48 What is more, the king said, ‘May Yahweh the God of Israel be blessed, who has given this day one sitting on my throne, and my eyes are seeing it!’ ” 49 Then all the invited guests who were for Adonijah trembled and got up and went, each on his way. 50 Adonijah was afraid because of Solomon, and he got up and went and grasped the horns of the altar. 51 Solomon was told, “Look, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, and he has grasped the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will surely not kill his servant with the sword!’ ” 52 Solomon said, “If he is a son of noble character, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, but if evil is found in him, then he will die.” 53 Then King Solomon sent and brought him down from upon the altar. He came and did obeisance to King Solomon. Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.” 1 The days of David came near for him to die, and he charged Solomon his son, saying, 2 “I am about to go the way of all the world. Be strong and be courageous. ",1 Kings 1:1-2:2,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-kings-1122-14221/direct-download/tbd20071004.mp3

He put the blood of war on the leather belt that was on his waist and on the sandals which were on his feet. 6 You must act according to your wisdom, but you must not let his gray hair go down to Sheol in peace. 7 Regarding the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, you shall do loyal love and let them be among those who eat at your table, because they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother. 8 And look, Shimei the son of Gera the son of the Benjaminite from Bahurim is with you. Now he cursed me severely when I went to Mahanaim, but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, so I swore to him by Yahweh, ‘I surely will not kill you with the sword.’ 9 So then, do not leave him unpunished, for you are a wise man, and you will know what you must do to him. You must bring his grey hair down to Sheol with blood.” 10 Then David slept with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David. 11 The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 12 Then Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established. 13 Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, and she said, “Are you coming in peace?” He said, “Peace.” 14 Then he said, “May I have a word with you?” Then she said, “Go on.” 15 He said, “You know that the kingship was mine and that all Israel had set their face toward me as king, but the kingship turned around and became my brother’s, for it was from Yahweh for him to have it. 16 Now one request I am asking from you, and you must not refuse me.” Then she said to him, “Go on.” 17 He said, “Please speak to King Solomon, for he will not refuse you, so that he will give to me Abishag the Shunnamite as wife.” 18 Then Bathsheba said, “Very well, I will speak to the king concerning you.” 19 Bathsheba came to King Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonijah, and the king got up to meet her, bowed down to her, and then sat on his throne. Then he set up a throne for the king’s mother, and she sat on his right. 20 She said, “I have one small request I am asking from you. Do not refuse me.” The king said to her, “Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse you.” 21 Then she said, “Let Abishag the Shunnamite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.” 22 King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “Why are you asking Abishag the Shunnamite for Adonijah? Ask for him also the kingdom, for he is my brother, older than I; and ask for him also Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.” 23 Then King Solomon swore by Yahweh, saying, “Thus may God do to me and thus may he add, if Adonijah hasn’t spoken this thing at the expense of his life. 24 So then, as Yahweh lives, who has established me and seated me on the throne of my father David and who has established for me a dynasty as he promised, then surely Adonijah will be put to death today.” 25 King Solomon sent through the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, so he struck him, and he died. 26 To Abiathar the priest, the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your field, for you deserve to die, but on this day I will not kill you, for you carried the ark of the Lord Yahweh before David my father, and because you endured hardship in all the hardship that my father endured.” 27 So Solomon banished Abiathar from being priest to Yahweh, thus fulfilling the word which Yahweh had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. 28 When the message came to Joab (now Joab had supported Adonijah but had not supported Absalom), he fled to the tent of Yahweh and grasped the horns of the altar. 29 It was told to King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of Yahweh and was beside the altar. So Solomon sent word to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go and fall upon him.” 30 So Benaiah went to the tent of Yahweh, and he said to him, “Thus says the king: ‘Come out.’ ” And he said, “No, for I want to die here.” So Benaiah returned a word to the king, saying, “Thus Joab spoke, and thus he answered me.” 31 Then the king said to him, “Do as he spoke; fall upon him and bury him, and so you shall remove the innocent blood that Joab shed from on me and from on the house of my father. 32 Yahweh will return his blood on his head, because he fell upon two men, more righteous and better than he, and he killed them with the sword, even though my father David did not know it; namely Abner son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah. 33 And their blood will return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever, but for David and his descendants and for his house and his throne, there will be peace forever from Yahweh.” 34 So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, and he fell on him and killed him, and he was buried in his house in the wilderness. 35 Then the king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army, and the king appointed Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar. 36 Then the king sent and summoned Shimei, and he said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but you must not go out anywhere whatsoever from there. 37 It shall happen that on the day you go out and cross over the Wadi Kidron, know for certain that you will surely die. Your blood will be on your head.” 38 Shimei said to the king, “The word is good that my lord the king has spoken to me; thus will your servant do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days. 39 It happened that at the end of three years, two of Shimei’s slaves fled to Achish, son of Maacah, the king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, “Your slaves are here in Gath.” 40 So Shimei got up and saddled his donkey, and he went to Gath, to Achish, to search for his slaves. So Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath. 41 When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, 42 the king sent and summoned Shimei, and he said to him, “Did I not make you swear by Yahweh? I warned you, saying, ‘On the day you go out and you go anywhere whatsoever, know for certain that you will surely die.’ And you said to me, ‘The word is good; I accept.’ 43 Why have you not kept the oath of Yahweh and the command which I commanded you?” 44 Then the king said to Shimei, “You know all the evil which your heart knows, what you did to David my father. Now Yahweh will return the evil on your head, 45 but King Solomon will be blessed and the throne of David will be established before Yahweh forever.” 46 Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and fell upon him, and he died. So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. 1 Solomon intermarried with Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and he took the daughter of Pharaoh and brought her to the city of David until he finished building his house, the house of Yahweh, and the walls of Jerusalem all around. 2 But the people were sacrificing on the high places, for the house for the name of Yahweh had not yet been built in those days. 3 Solomon loved Yahweh, by walking in the statutes of David his father; only he was sacrificing and offering incense on the high places. 4 So the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice, for the great high place was there. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. 5 Yahweh appeared to Solomon at Gibeon in a dream at night, and God said, “Ask what I should give to you.” ",1 Kings 2:2-3:5,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-kings-2235-14222/direct-download/tbd20071005.mp3
1 Kings,"6 Then Solomon said, “You have shown great loyal love with your servant David my father, as he walked before you in faithfulness and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with you. You have shown for him this great loyal love, and you have given a son to him who is sitting on his throne as it is this day. 7 So then, O Yahweh, you are my God. You have made your servant king in place of David my father though I am a young boy. I do not know going out or coming in. 8 Your servant is in the middle of your people whom you have chosen; a great people who cannot be counted or numbered because of abundance. 9 Give to your servant a listening heart to judge your people, to discern between good and bad, because who is able to judge this, your difficult people?” 10 The word was good in the eyes of the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing. 11 And God said to him, “Because you have asked this thing and you did not ask for yourself a long life and you did not ask riches for yourself and you did not ask for the life of your enemies, but you have asked for yourself the ability to make wise judgments; 12 behold, I do hereby do according to your word. I hereby give you a wise and discerning heart; there was no one like you before you, nor afterwards will one like you arise. 13 Too, what you have not asked I give to you: both riches and honor, so that no man among the kings will be like you all of your days. 14 If you will walk in my ways by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David your father walked, then I will lengthen your days.” 15 Then Solomon awoke, and look, it was a dream, and he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and he offered burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings, and he held a feast for all of his servants. 16 Then two prostitutes came to the king, and they stood before him. 17 The one woman said, “Please my lord, I and this woman are living in one house, and I gave birth, with her in the house. 18 It happened on the third day after my giving birth, this woman also gave birth, and we were together. There was not anyone with us in the house, only the two of us were in the house. 19 Then the son of this woman died in the night because she laid on him. 20 So she got up in the middle of the night, and she took my son from beside me while your servant was asleep, and she put him in her lap, and she put her dead son in my lap. 21 When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead! When I looked closely at him in the morning, behold, it was not my son whom I had borne.” 22 Then the other woman said, “No, for my son is the living one, and your son is the dead one.” The other kept on saying, “No, for your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one,” and so they argued in front of the king. 23 Then the king said, “This one is saying, ‘This is my son, the living one, but your son is the dead one,’ and the other one keeps saying, ‘But no! Your son is the dead one, and my son is living!’ ” 24 So the king said, “Bring me a sword,” and they brought the sword before the king. 25 Then the king said, “Divide the living child into two, and give half to the one and half to the other.” 26 Then the woman whose son was the living one spoke to the king because her compassion was aroused for her son, and she said, “Please, my lord, give her the living child, but certainly do not kill him!” The other one was saying, “As for me, so for you! Divide him!” 27 Then the king answered and said, “Give the living child to her, and do not kill him; she is his mother.” 28 When all of Israel heard the judgment that the king had rendered, they stood in awe of the king, because they realized that the wisdom of God was in him to execute justice. 1 King Solomon was king over all Israel. 2 Now these are the officials who were his: Azariah the son of Zadok was the priest. 3 Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, were the secretaries; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder. 4 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests. 5 Azariah the son of Nathan was over the governors, and Zabud the son of Nathan was a priest, an advisor to the king. 6 Ahishar was over the palace, and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the forced labor. 7 Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel, and they sustained the king and his palace, each one was to sustain for each month of the year. 8 These are their names: Ben-Hur was in the hill country of Ephraim. 9 Ben-Deker was in Makaz and in Shaalbim and in Beth-Shemesh and Elon of Beth-Hanan. 10 Ben-Hesed was in the Arubbot; Socoh and all the land of Hepher were his. 11 Ben-Abinadab was in all of Naphat of Dor; Taphath the daughter of Solomon was his wife. 12 Baanah the son of Ahilud was in Taanach and Megiddo and all Beth-Shean which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, of Beth-Shean up to Abel-Meholah up to the other side of Jokmeam. 13 Ben-Geber was in Ramoth-Gilead; the villages of Jair, the son of Manasseh which are in the Gilead were his, and the region of Argob which is in the Bashan, sixty great cities, with walls having crossbars of bronze, were his. 14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo was in Mahanaim. 15 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he moreover also had taken Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife. 16 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and Bealoth. 17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah was in Issachar. 18 Shimei the son of Ela was in Benjamin. 19 Geber the son of Uri was in the land of Gilead, the land of Sihon, the king of the Amorites, and of Og, the king of Bashan; one governor which was over the land. 20 Judah and Israel were as many as the sand which is on the seashore in abundance, eating and drinking and rejoicing! 21 Now Solomon was ruling over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and up to the border of Egypt, who were bringing tribute and were serving Solomon all the days of his life. 22 The food of Solomon for one day was thirty dry measures of choice meal and sixty dry measures of flour; 23 ten stall-fed oxen and twenty pasture-fed oxen and a hundred sheep, besides deer and buck gazelles and roebucks and well-fed fowls. 24 For he was ruling over all the west of the River from Tiphsah up to Gaza, over all the kings west of the River; and he had peace from every side all around. 25 Judah and Israel lived in security, each man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan as far as Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. 26 Now Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his war chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. 27 These governors sustained King Solomon and all who came near to the table of King Solomon, each in his month; they did not omit anything. 28 The barley and the straw for the horses and for packhorses they brought to the place where they were, each according to his share. 29 God gave wisdom to Solomon and very great discernment, as well as breadth of understanding, as the sand which is on the edge of the seashore. 30 The wisdom of Solomon was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the east and more than all the wisdom of Egypt. 31 He was wiser than all the men: Ethan the Ezrahite; Heman, Calcol, and Darda the children of Mahol; and he was very well known. 32 He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were one thousand and five. 33 He spoke concerning the trees, from the cedar which is in Lebanon up to the hyssop which grows on the wall; he also spoke concerning the animals, concerning the birds, concerning the creeping things, and concerning the fish. 34 They came from all the nations to hear the wisdom of Solomon; from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.

1 Kings,"1 Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him as king in place of his father, for Hiram had always been a friend for David. 2 Then Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 3 “You knew David my father, that he was not able to build a house for the name of Yahweh his God, in view of the warfare which surrounded him, until Yahweh placed them under the soles of his feet. 4 But now Yahweh my God has given me rest all around me. There is no adversary, and there is no bad occurrence. 5 Here I am, intending to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, as Yahweh promised to my father David, saying, ‘Your son, whom I will set in your place on your throne, shall build the house for my name.’ 6 So then, command that they may cut cedars for me from Lebanon, and let my servants be with your servants. The wage of your servants I will give to you according to all that you say, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.” 7 When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and he said, “Blessed be Yahweh this day, who has given to David a wise son over this great people.” 8 Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard what you have sent to me; I will do all of your desire concerning the timber of cedars and concerning the timber of cypresses. 9 My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them into rafts in the sea to float to the place which you indicated to me. Then I shall break them up there, and you may carry them further, and you shall meet my needs by giving food for my house.” 10 So Hiram was giving to Solomon the cedar timbers and the cypress timbers, everything he needed. 11 Then Solomon gave to Hiram twenty thousand dry measures of wheat as food for his household, and twenty dry measures of specially prepared olive oil; thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year. 12 Yahweh gave wisdom to Solomon as he promised to him, and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a covenant. 13 Then King Solomon conscripted a forced labor from all Israel, and the forced labor numbered thirty thousand men. 14 He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand every month; the work groups were a month in Lebanon and two months at home; now Adoniram was over the forced labor. 15 Solomon had seventy thousand common laborers and eighty thousand stone craftsmen in the hill country. 16 Besides the chiefs of the officers Solomon had, there were three thousand three hundred having charge over the people who were doing the work. 17 When the king commanded, they quarried great stones and precious stones to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stones. 18 So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites hewed stones, and they prepared the timber and the stone to build the house. 1 It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites went out from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s rule over Israel, the month of Ziv (that is the second month), that he began to build the house for Yahweh. 2 Now the house that King Solomon built for Yahweh was sixty cubits in its length and twenty cubits in its width and thirty cubits in its height. 3 The vestibule on the face of the main hall of the temple was twenty cubits in its length, and the width of the temple was ten cubits wide on the face of the temple. 4 And he made for the temple specially designed framed windows, 5 and he built a structure against the wall of the temple running all along the walls of the house, for the outer sanctuary and for the inner sanctuary, and made side rooms all around. 6 The lower structure was five cubits in its width and the middle was six cubits in its width and the third was seven cubits in its width, for he made niches for the temple all around to the outside, so that beams would not attach to the walls of the temple. 7 Now while the temple was being built, it was built with stones finished at the quarry, so that no hammer or stone shaping tool or any instrument of iron was heard in the temple as it was being built. 8 The doorway of the side room in the middle of the side of the temple was on the south; they went up with a stairway to the middle and from the middle to the third floor. 9 So he built the house and finished it. He covered the temple with rafters and wood planks and with the cedars. 10 He also built the structure against all of the temple five cubits in height and fastened it to the temple with beams of cedar. 11 Then the word of Yahweh came to Solomon, saying, 12 “Regarding this temple that you are building: if you walk in my ordinances and if you do my judgments and you keep all my commandments to walk in them, then I will establish my promise with you which I made to David your father. 13 And I will dwell among the Israelites, and I will not forsake my people Israel.” 14 So Solomon built the temple and finished it. 15 He lined the walls of the inside of the house with boards of cedar; from the floor of the temple up to the rafters of the ceiling he covered them with wood on the inside. He also covered the floor of the temple with cypress boards. 16 He built twenty cubits from the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor up to the ceiling, and he built for it an inner sanctuary on the inside, as the most holy place. 17 The main hall of the temple was forty cubits in front of the inner sanctuary, 18 with the cedar within the inner house having carvings of gourds and buds of flowers. It was entirely of cedar; there was not a stone visible. 19 Now in the inner sanctuary in the middle of the temple he prepared the inside to place the ark of the covenant of Yahweh there. 20 In front, the inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide and twenty cubits high, and he overlaid it with pure gold and covered the altar with cedar. 21 Solomon overlaid the temple on the inside with pure gold, and he drew across it with golden chains in front of the inner sanctuary, which he overlaid with gold. 22 All of the temple he overlaid with gold until all of the temple was finished; all of the altar which belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold. 23 He made two cherubim of olive wood for the inner sanctuary, ten cubits high. 24 Five cubits was the first wing of the cherub, and five cubits the second wing of the cherub; ten cubits from the tip of his one wing up to the tip of his other wing. 25 The second cherub was ten cubits according to the same measurement, and there was one shape for the two cherubim. 26 The height of the first cherub was ten cubits and so was the second cherub. 27 He placed the cherubim in the middle of the inner house, and they spread out the wings of the cherubim; the wing of the first cherub touched against the wall and the wing of the second cherub was touching against the second wall; their wings spread to the middle of the house and were touching wing to wing. 28 He also overlaid the cherubim with gold. 29 On all of the walls around the house, he carved engravings of cherubim and palm tree images and budding flowers both inside and out. 30 He overlaid the floor of the house with gold both inside and out. 31 He made doors of olive wood for the doorway of the inner sanctuary, as well as for the doorpost of the fifth doorframe. 32 On the two doors of olive wood he made carvings of cherubim and palm tree images and budding flowers, and he overlaid them with gold by beating out the gold on the cherubim and the palm tree images. 33 Thus he made doorframes of olive wood on four sides for the doorway of the main hall 34 and two doors of cypress wood; one door with two folding panels and the second door with two folding panels. 35 He carved cherubim and palm tree images and budding flowers and overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work. 36 Then he built the inner courtyard with three rows of dressed stone and a row of cedar beams. 37 In the fourth year, the house of Yahweh was founded in the month of Ziv. 38 In the eleventh year in the month of Bul, that is, the eighth month, the house was finished according to all his specifications and according to all his plans. He had built it in seven years. ",1 Kings 5-6,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-kings-56-14224/direct-download/tbd20071009.mp3
1 Kings,"1 Solomon built his house over thirteen years, and he finished all of his house. 2 He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon; one hundred cubits its length, fifty cubits its width, and thirty cubits its height, on four rows of cedar pillars and cedar beams atop the pillars. 3 It was covered with cedar above, and the supporting beams which were on the forty-five pillars, fifteen to the row. 4 There were three rows of specially designed windows; with window to window three times. 5 All of the doorways and the doorframes had four-sided casings, with opening to opposite opening three times. 6 The hall of pillars he made fifty cubits in its length and thirty cubits in its width, and a porch was in front of them, with pillars and an overhang in front of them. 7 He made the hall of the throne where he would pronounce judgment, the hall of justice, and it was covered with cedar from the floor to the rafters. 8 His house where he would live in the next courtyard on the inside of the porch was like this work, and he would make a house like this porch for the daughter of Pharaoh whom Solomon had taken as wife. 9 All of these were of precious stones, according to the measurement of dressed stone, sawn with a saw on all sides; from the foundation up to the eaves and from the outside up to the great courtyard. 10 The foundation was of precious stones, and large stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits 11 with precious stones above, just the right size, and cedar. 12 The great courtyard all around had three rows of dressed stones and a row of cedar beams; for both the courtyard of the inner house of Yahweh and for the porch of the house. 13 King Solomon invited and received Hiram from Tyre. 14 He was the son of a widow woman from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, an artisan of bronze. He was filled with wisdom and with ability and with the knowledge to do all the work with the bronze. And he came to King Solomon, and he did all of his work. 15 He cast the two pillars out of bronze; eighteen cubits was the height of the first, and a cord of twelve cubits would encircle the second pillar. 16 He made two capitals to place on the tops of the pillars out of molten bronze; the first capital was five cubits in height, and the second capital was five cubits in height. 17 A network of latticework and wreaths of chainwork with small chains were for the capitals which were on top of the pillars; seven for the first capital and seven for the second capital. 18 He also made the pillars with two rows around on the lattice, each to cover the capitals which were on top, out of the pomegranate-shaped ornaments, and thus he did for the second capital as well. 19 And on the capitals which were on top of the pillars in the porch were works of lilies four cubits high. 20 And capitals were on the two pillars above near the bulging section which was beside the lattice, and two hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments were in rows all around on the second capital. 21 He set up the pillars for the porch of the main hall; he erected the pillar on the right and called its name Jakin, and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name Boaz. 22 On the top of the pillars was a work of lilies; and so the work of the pillars was finished. 23 He also made the molten sea, ten cubits in diameter, and five cubits was its height. A measuring line of thirty cubits would encircle it all around. 24 Gourds were under its rim surrounding it all around; ten to the cubit, surrounding the sea all around with two rows of gourds, which were cast when he cast the metal. 25 The sea was standing on twelve oxen, with three facing to the north, three facing to the west, three facing to the south, and three facing to the east. The sea was on top of them, with all of their hindquarters turned to the inside. 26 Its thickness was a handbreadth, but its rim was as the work on the brim of a cup, like the bud of a lily; it held two thousand baths. 27 He made the ten stands of bronze; each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits in height. 28 Now this was the construction of the stands: there were frames for them and frames between the crossbars, 29 and on the frames which were between the crossbars were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the crossbars both above and beneath the lions and oxen were works of cascading wreaths. 30 There were four bronze wheels for each of the stands, with bronze axles; the four support pedestals for these were under the basin, and the supports were decorated on each side with wreaths. 31 Its opening from the inside of the capital and above was a cubit; its pedestal was a round work of a cubit and a half; moreover, on its opening were the carvings with four-sided frames, not circular. 32 Four of the wheels were underneath the frames, and the axles of the wheels were on the stands. The height of each wheel was a cubit and a half. 33 The construction of the wheel was like the construction of the wheel of the chariot; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their naves were all cast. 34 The four supports were the four corners of each stand, with the stand supporting it. 35 On top of the stand was half a cubit deep, circular all around, and on the top of the stand were its supports and its frames. 36 He engraved on the plates, on its supports, and on its frame cherubim, lions and images of a palm tree, according to the space for each, with wreaths all around. 37 He made the ten stands like this in one cast, with the same measurement and shape for each of them. 38 He also made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths; each basin was four cubits, one basin on each of the ten stands. 39 He placed five of the stands on the south side of the house and five on the north side of the house, and the sea he set on the southeast side of the house. 40 Hiram also made the basins and the shovels and the bowls for drinking wine; and so Hiram finished doing all of the work that he was to do for King Solomon in the house of Yahweh: 41 the two pillars and the bowls of the capitals which were atop the two pillars, and the two lattice works to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were atop the pillars; 42 and the four hundred pomegranate-shaped ornaments for the two lattice works, the two rows of pomegranate-shaped ornaments for each latticework to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the surface of the pillars; 43 and the ten stands and the ten basins on the stands; 44 and the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea; 45 and the pots, the shovels, and the bowls for drinking wine. All the vessels of the tent which Hiram had made for King Solomon for the house of Yahweh were polished bronze. 46 The king had cast them in the plain of the Jordan with the casting mold set in the ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 47 Solomon left all of the vessels unweighed because of their very great abundance, so the weight of the bronze could not be determined. 48 Solomon also made all of the vessels which were in the house of Yahweh: the golden altar and the golden table on which was the bread of the presence; 49 as well as the five lampstands of beaten gold at the south and five lampstands at the north before the presence of the inner sanctuary, with the flower-shaped ornaments, the lamps, and the pair of tongs all of gold. 50 The cups, the snuffers, the bowls for drinking wine, the bowls for the incense, and the firepans were made from beaten gold; the facades for the doors of the inner house, for the most holy place, for the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold. 51 When all of the work which king Solomon did on the house of Yahweh was completed, Solomon brought out the holy objects of his father David, the silver and the gold and the vessels, which he put in the treasury rooms of the house of Yahweh. 1 At that time, Solomon assembled the elders of Israel—all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the families of the Israelites—before King Solomon in Jerusalem, in order to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh from the city of David, that is, Zion. 2 All the men of Israel assembled before King Solomon at the festival in the month of Ethnaim, that is, the seventh month. 3 All the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the ark. 4 So they brought up the ark of Yahweh and the tent of assembly and all of the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up. 5 King Solomon and all the assembly of Israel who were assembling with him in the presence of the ark were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted nor numbered because of abundance. 6 The priests brought the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place in the inner sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim, 7 for the cherubim were spreading their wings over the place of the ark. The cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles from above. 8 The poles were long, and the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from the outside, and they are there until this day. 9 There was not anything in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses had placed there at Horeb, where Yahweh made a covenant with the Israelites after they went out from the land of Egypt. 10 When the priests went out from the holy place, the cloud filled the house of Yahweh. 11 The priests were not able to stand to minister because of the presence of the cloud, for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh. 12 Then Solomon said, “Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the very thick cloud. 13 I have certainly built a lofty house for you, a place for you to live forever.” 14 Then the king turned his face around, and he blessed all of the assembly of Israel. (Now all the assembly of Israel was standing). 15 Then he said, “Blessed be Yahweh the God of Israel who has promised with his mouth to David my father and fulfilled by his oath, saying, 16 ‘From the day that I brought out my people Israel from Egypt I have not chosen a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a house where my name might be, but I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’ 17 David my father desired to build a house for the name of Yahweh the God of Israel, 18 but Yahweh said to David my father, ‘Because you desired to build a house for my name, you did well in that it was within your heart. 19 However, you will not build the house, but your son who has come from your loins, he shall build the house for my name.’ 20 Yahweh has carried out his promise which he had made; I have risen in place of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel as Yahweh promised, and I have built the house for the name of Yahweh the God of Israel. 21 I have provided a place there for the ark, in which is the covenant which Yahweh made with our ancestors when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.” 22 Then Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all of the assembly of Israel, and he spread out his hands to the heavens, 23 and he said, “O Yahweh, God of Israel, there is no god like you in the heavens above or on the earth beneath, keeping the covenant and the loyal love for your servants who are walking before you with all their heart. 24 You have kept for your servant David my father what you promised to him, and you have spoken with your mouth, and with your hand you have fulfilled it this very day. 25 So then, O Yahweh, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you promised to him, saying, ‘For you, no man will be cut off from before me who will be sitting on the throne of Israel, if only your sons keep their ways to walk before me just as you have walked before me.’ 26 So then, O God of Israel, please let your word be confirmed which you have promised to your servant David my father. 27 For will God really dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the heaven of heavens could not contain you! How could this house that I have built? 28 You must regard the prayer of your servant and his plea! O Yahweh my God, listen to the pleading and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you this day, 29 so that your eyes will be open to this house night and day, to the place which you said, ‘My name will be there,’ to hear the prayer that your servant prays toward this place. 30 You must listen to the plea of your servant and your people Israel which they pray toward this place; and you must hear from the place where you live, from heaven you must hear and you must forgive. 31 If a man sins against his neighbor and he pronounces an oath against him to curse him, and the curse comes before your altar in this house, 32 then you shall hear in heaven and you shall act and you shall judge your servant, to declare the wicked guilty by bringing his way upon his head and to declare the righteous innocent by rewarding him according to his righteousness. 33 When your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they sinned against you, and when they turn to you and confess your name and pray and beg for mercy from you in this house, 34 then you shall hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and you shall bring them back to the ground which you gave to their ancestors. 35 When you shut up the heavens so there is no rain because they have sinned against you, then they pray to this place and they confess your name and they return from their sin because you punished them, 36 then you shall hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants and your people Israel, for you will teach them the good way in which they should go, and you will give rain upon your land which you have given to your people as an inheritance. 37 If there should be in the land famine or disease, if there should be blight or mildew or locust or caterpillars, if it happens that his enemy lays siege against him in the land of his gates, if any plague or any disease, 38 any prayer or any plea which is offered by any person for all of your people Israel, who each knows the infestation of his own heart and spreads out his palms to this house, 39 then you shall hear in heaven the place of your dwelling, and you shall forgive and act and give to the man whose heart you know, according to all his ways, for you alone know the heart of all the sons of man. 40 Do these things so that they may fear you all the days that they live on the face of the land that you gave to our ancestors. 41 Also for the foreigner who is not from your people Israel, and he comes from a distant land because of your name, 42 (for they shall hear of your great name and your powerful hand and your outstretched arm), and he shall come and pray toward this house, 43 you shall hear in heaven, the place of your dwelling, and act according to all that the foreigner calls to you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you as your people Israel, and to know that your name has been invoked over this house that I have built. 44 If your people go out to battle against his enemy in the way that you shall send them and they pray to Yahweh, toward the city which you have chosen and the house which I have built for your name, 45 then you shall hear in heaven their prayer and their plea, and you shall vindicate them.

1 Kings,"46 “If they sin against you (for there is not a person who does not sin) and you are angry with them and you give them to an enemy and they take them captive to the land of the enemy far or near, 47 and then they return their heart in the land where they have been taken captive and they return and plead to you in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned and we did wrong. We acted wickedly,’ 48 if they return to you with all of their heart and with all of their soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive and they pray to you toward their land which you gave to their ancestors, the city that you have chosen and the house that you built for your name, 49 then you shall hear in heaven, the place of your dwelling, their prayer and their plea, and you shall vindicate them. 50 You shall forgive your people who sinned against you, even for all their transgressions which they committed against you. You shall give them compassion before their captors so that they may have compassion on them, 51 for they are your people and your inheritance whom you brought from Egypt from the middle of the smelter of iron. 52 O, that your eyes may be open to the plea of your servant and to the plea of your people Israel, to listen to them in all things when they call to you. 53 For you have separated them for yourself as an inheritance from all the peoples of the earth, as you promised through the hand of Moses your servant when you brought out our ancestors from Egypt, my Lord Yahweh!” 54 It happened that when Solomon finished praying to Yahweh all of the prayer and this plea, he got up from before the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling down on his knees with his palms outstretched to heaven. 55 He stood and blessed all of the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 56 “Blessed be Yahweh who gave a resting place to his people Israel. According to all that he promised, not one word has fallen from all of his promises concerning the good which he spoke through the hand of Moses his servant. 57 May Yahweh our God be with us as he was with our ancestors, and may he not leave us or abandon us, 58 to incline our hearts toward him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his judgments which he commanded our ancestors. 59 Let these my words which I pleaded before Yahweh be near to Yahweh our God, by day and by night, to maintain the justice of his servant and the justice of his people Israel as each day requires 60 so that all of the people of the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God; there is none other. 61 Let your heart be completely with Yahweh our God by walking in his statutes, by keeping his commands as this day.” 62 Then the king and all of Israel with him offered a sacrifice in the presence of Yahweh. 63 Solomon sacrificed the fellowship offerings which he offered to Yahweh: twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep; and the king and all of the Israelites dedicated the house of Yahweh. 64 On that day the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard before the house of Yahweh because he offered there the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings because the bronze altar that was in the presence of Yahweh was too small to hold the burnt offerings and the grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings. 65 Solomon held the festival at that time and all of Israel with him, a great assembly from Lebo Hamath up to the wadi of Egypt before Yahweh our God, for seven days and seven days, a total of fourteen days. 66 On the eighth day, he sent the people away, and they blessed the king, and they went to their tents rejoicing and in good spirits because of all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his servant and to Israel his people. 1 It happened that as Solomon finished the building of the house of Yahweh, the king’s house, and all the things Solomon desired to do, 2 Yahweh appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him in Gibeon. 3 Yahweh said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your plea which you have made before me. I have consecrated this house which you have built, by putting my name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there. 4 As for you, if you walk before me as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and with uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and if you keep my ordinances and my judgments, 5 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, ‘A man will not be cut off for you from upon the throne of Israel.’ 6 “If ever you or any of your descendants turn from following me and do not keep my commandments and my ordinances that I have set before you and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, 7 then I will cut Israel off from the face of the land that I have given to them, even the house which I have consecrated for my name I will cast away from my face; and Israel shall become a proverb and an object of taunting among all the peoples. 8 This house shall become a heap of ruins; all those passing by will be appalled by it and hiss, and they will say, ‘On what account did Yahweh do this to this land and to this house?’ 9 And they will say, ‘Because they have forsaken Yahweh their God who brought their ancestors out from the land of Egypt and they embraced other gods and bowed down to them and served them. Therefore, Yahweh brought on them all of this disaster.’ ” 10 It happened at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Yahweh and the house of the king, 11 since Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with wood of cedar and with wood of cypresses and with the gold according to all his desire, then King Solomon gave twenty cities in the land of the Galilee to Hiram. 12 So Hiram went out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, but they were not right in his eyes. 13 So he said, “What are these cities that you have given to me, my brother?” So they are called the land of Cabul until this day. 14 Then Hiram sent to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold. 15 This is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon conscripted to build the house of Yahweh and his house, the Millo, the walls of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 16 Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had gone up and captured Gezer and burnt it with fire. He had also killed the Canaanites who were living in the city and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, the wife of Solomon. 17 Solomon rebuilt Gezer and Lower Beth-Horon, 18 as well as Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness in the land; 19 and he also built all of the storage cities which were Solomon’s, the cities for the chariots, the cities for the cavalry, and all of Solomon’s desire that he wanted to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion. 20 All of the people who were remaining from the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites who were not of the Israelites, 21 their children who remained after them in the land, whom the Israelites were not able to completely destroy, Solomon conscripted them for forced labor, until this very day. 22 But from the Israelites Solomon did not make a slave, but they were the men of war, his officers, his commanders, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and his cavalry. 23 These were the commanders of the overseers who were over the work for Solomon, five hundred and fifty, ruling over the people doing the work. 24 As soon as the daughter of Pharaoh went up from the city of David to her house which he built for her, then he built the Millo. 25 Solomon sacrificed three times a year: burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar that he had built to Yahweh, and he offered incense with it before Yahweh; and so he completed the house. 26 King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion-Geber which is near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom. 27 Hiram sent his servants with the fleet of ships, sailors who knew the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 28 They went to Ophir and imported from there four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and they brought it to King Solomon. 1 Now the queen of Sheba had heard of the fame of Solomon regarding the name of Yahweh, and she came to test him with hard questions. 2 So she came to Jerusalem with very great wealth; with camels carrying spices, very much gold, and precious stones. She came to Solomon, and she spoke to him all that was on her heart. 3 Solomon answered all of her questions; there was not a thing hidden from the king which he could not explain to her. 4 When the queen of Sheba observed all the wisdom of Solomon and the house which he had built, 5 the food of his table, the seat of his servants, the manner of his servants and their clothing, his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings which he offered in the house of Yahweh, she was breathless. 6 Then she said to the king, “The report which I heard in my land was true concerning your accomplishments and your wisdom. 7 I had not believed the report to be true until I came and my eyes had seen, and behold! The half had not been told to me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I had heard. 8 Happy are your men and happy are these your servants who stand before you continually hearing your wisdom. 9 May Yahweh your God be blessed, who has delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel, because of the love of Yahweh for Israel forever, and he has made you king to execute justice and righteousness.” 10 Then she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, abundant spices, and precious stones. Spices as these did not come again in such abundance as that which the queen of Sheba brought to King Solomon. 11 Moreover, the fleet of ships of Hiram which carried the gold from Ophir also brought from Ophir abundant amounts of almug wood and precious stones. 12 The king made a raised structure for the house of Yahweh and for the house of the king out of the almug wood, as well as lyres and harps for the singers. This much almug wood has not come nor been seen again up to this day. 13 King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all of her desire that she asked, besides that which King Solomon freely offered her. Then she turned and went to her land with her servants. 14 The weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, 15 apart from that of the men of the traders and the profits of the traders, and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the land. 16 King Solomon made two hundred shields of hammered gold; six hundred measures of gold went up over each shield. 17 Also he made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold went up over each of the small shields; and the king put them into the House of the Forest of Lebanon. 18 The king also made a large ivory throne, and he overlaid it with fine gold. 19 Six steps led up to the throne, and there was a circular top to the throne behind it, and armrests were on each side of the seat, with two lions standing beside the armrests. 20 Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps, on either side; nothing like this was made for any of the kingdoms. 21 All of the drinking vessels of King Solomon were gold, and all the vessels for the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver; it was not considered as something valuable in the days of Solomon. 22 For the fleet of Tarshish belonged to the king and was on the sea with the fleet of Hiram; once every three years the fleet of Tarshish used to come carrying gold and silver, ivory, apes, and baboons.

1 Kings,"23 King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth with respect to wealth and wisdom. 24 All of the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart. 25 They were each bringing his gift; objects of silver and objects of gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This used to happen year after year. 26 Solomon gathered chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses. He stationed them in the cities of the chariots and with the king in Jerusalem. 27 The king made the silver in Jerusalem as the stones, and the cedars he made as the sycamore fig trees which are in the Shephelah in abundance. 28 The import of the horses which were Solomon’s was from Egypt and from Kue; the traders of the king received horses from Kue at a price. 29 A chariot went up and went out from Egypt at six hundred silver shekels and a horse at a hundred and fifty. So it was for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Aram; by their hand they were exported. 1 King Solomon loved many foreign women: the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, Hittite; 2 from the nations which Yahweh had said to the Israelites, “You shall not marry them, and they shall not marry you. They will certainly turn your heart after their gods.” But Solomon clung to them to love. 3 He had seven hundred princesses and three hundred concubines, and his wives turned his heart. 4 It happened at the time of Solomon’s old age that his wives guided his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully with Yahweh his God as the heart of David his father had been. 5 Solomon went after Ashtoreth the god of the Sidonians and after Molech the abhorrence of the Ammonites. 6 So Solomon did evil in the eyes of Yahweh and did not fully follow after Yahweh as David his father. 7 At that time, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, on the mountain which faces Jerusalem and for Molech, the abomination of the Ammonites. 8 Thus he did for all of his foreign wives, offering incense and sacrificing to their gods. 9 Yahweh was angry with Solomon, for he had turned his heart from Yahweh, the God of Israel who had appeared to him twice. 10 And he had commanded him concerning this matter not to go after other gods, but he did not keep that which Yahweh commanded. 11 So Yahweh said to Solomon, “Because this was with you, and you did not keep my covenant and my ordinances which I have commanded you, I will certainly tear the kingdom from you, and I will give it to your servant. 12 However, I will not do it in your days, for the sake of David your father; from the hand of your son I will tear it away. 13 Yet all of the kingdom I will not tear away. I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.” 14 Then Yahweh raised an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite, from the descendants of that king in Edom. 15 It had happened that when David was at Edom, Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, and he killed every male in Edom. 16 For Joab and all Israel had stayed there six months until he exterminated every male in Edom. 17 But Hadad himself had fled, and some Edomite men from the servants of his father with him, to go to Egypt, when Hadad was a young boy. 18 They had set out from Midian until they came to Paran where they took men from Paran with them and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt. He gave to him a house and assigned food for him and gave him land. 19 Hadad found great favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, and he gave him the sister of his wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen, as wife. 20 The sister of Tahpenes bore Genubath his son for him, and Tahpenes weaned him in the middle of the house of Pharaoh. Genubath was in the house of Pharaoh in the midst of the children of Pharaoh. 21 Now Hadad heard in Egypt that David had slept with his ancestors and that Joab the commander of the army was dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Send me away that I may go to my land.” 22 Pharaoh said to him, “What do you lack with me that you now are seeking to go to your land?” He said, “No, but you must surely send me away.” 23 God had also raised Rezon the son of Eliada as an adversary against him, who had fled from Hadadezer the king of Zobah, his master. 24 He gathered men around him and he became the commander of bandits. When David killed some of them, they went to Damascus and settled there, and they reigned in Damascus. 25 He was an adversary for Israel all the days of Solomon, and along with the evil that Hadad did, he detested Israel while he reigned over Aram. 26 Now Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah (now the name of his mother was Zeruah, a widow woman), a servant of Solomon rebelled against the king. 27 This is the reason that he rebelled against the king: when Solomon built the Millo, he closed the gap of the city of David his father. 28 Now the man Jeroboam was a man of ability, and Solomon saw that the young man was a diligent worker, so he appointed him over all of the forced labor for the house of Joseph. 29 It happened at that time that Jeroboam went out from Jerusalem, and he accidentally met Ahijah the Shilonite the prophet on the way. Now he had clothed himself with new clothing. While the two of them were alone in the field, 30 Ahijah took hold of the new cloak which was on him and tore it into twelve pieces. 31 Then he said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and I will give to you ten tribes, 32 but one tribe shall be for him, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel; 33 because he has forsaken me, and they bowed down to Ashtoreth, the god of the Sidonians, to Chemosh, the god of Moab, and to Molech, the god of the Ammonites. They did not walk in my ways to do right in my eyes, my ordinances, or my judgments, as did David his father. 34 But I will not take all of the kingdom from his hand, but I will make him a leader all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my ordinances. 35 But I will take the kingship from the hand of his son, and I will give ten tribes to you. 36 To his son I will give one tribe in order to be a lamp for my servant David, always before my face, in Jerusalem the city in which I have chosen to place my name. 37 You I will take, and you shall reign over all your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel. 38 It shall be that if you listen to all that I command you and you walk in my ways and you do right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, then I will be with you, and I will build an enduring house for you as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. 39 I will punish the offspring of David on account of this; however, not always.’ ”40 Then Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam got up and fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king of Egypt, and he remained in Egypt until the death of Solomon. 41 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon and all that he did and his wisdom; are they not written on the scroll of the acts of Solomon? 42 All the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all of Israel were forty years. 43 Then Solomon slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David his father, and Rehoboam his son became king in his place. 1 Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all of Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 2 It happened that Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it while he was still in Egypt where he had fled from the face of King Solomon, and Jeroboam had lived in Egypt. 3 So they sent and summoned him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came. Then they spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 4 “Your father made our yoke heavy; now lighten the hard labor of your father and the heavy yoke which he placed on us, and we will serve you.” 5 He said, “Go up for three days and then return to me”; so the people went away. 6 Then King Rehoboam consulted with the old men who had been serving before Solomon his father when he was alive, saying, “How are you advising me to answer this people?” 7 They said to him, “If you will be a servant today to this people, then you will serve them; and if you answer them and speak good words to them, they will always be your servants.” 8 But he rejected the advice of the old men, which they gave him, and he consulted with the youngsters who had grown up with him, who were serving before him. 9 He said to them, “What are you advising that we should reply to this people who spoke to me by saying, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us.’ ” 10 Then the youngsters who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall say to this people who spoke to you: ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us,’ you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins. 11 So then, my father loaded a heavy yoke on all of you, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions!’ ” 12 Jeroboam and all of the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had spoken: “Return to me on the third day.” 13 Then the king answered all the people harshly, as he had rejected the advice of the old men that they had offered. 14 He spoke to them according to the advice of the youngsters, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add onto your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.” 15 So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turning of events from Yahweh in order to fulfill his word which Yahweh had spoken through the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 16 When all of Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What share do we have in David? There is no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now look to your house, David!” Then Israel went to their tents. 17 The Israelites were living in the cities of Judah, and Rehoboam was reigning over them. 18 King Rehoboam sent Adoram who was over the forced labor, and all of Israel cast stones at him and he died, but King Rehoboam managed to get up on the chariot to flee to Jerusalem. 19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David until this day. 20 It happened that just when all of Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all of Israel. Not one followed after the house of David except the tribe of Judah alone. 21 When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all of the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand choice troops to fight with the house of Israel, to restore the kingship to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 22 Then the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 23 “Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon the king of Judah and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and the remainder of the people, saying, 24 ‘Thus says Yahweh: “You shall not go up and you shall not fight with your brothers the Israelites. Return each of you to his house, for this thing was from me.” ’ ” So they heeded the word of Yahweh, and they returned to go home according to the word of Yahweh. 25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and he resided in it. Then he went out from there and built Penuel. 26 Then Jeroboam said to himself, “Now the kingdom will return to the house of David 27 if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem. The heart of this people will return to their master Rehoboam the king of Judah, and they shall kill me and return to him.” 28 And the king had decided, so he made two golden calves and he said to them, “You have been going up to Jerusalem long enough; here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.” 29 He put one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. 30 This thing became a sin, and the people walked before the one as far as Dan. 31 Then he built the houses on the high places, and he appointed priests from all walks of life who were not from the sons of Levi. 32 Jeroboam also inaugurated a religious feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the religious feast which was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar. Thus he did in Bethel, by sacrificing to the calves that he had made; and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made. 33 He offered sacrifices on the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month which his heart had devised. He inaugurated a religious feast for the Israelites, and he went up to the altar to offer incense.

1 Kings,"1 Suddenly a man of God from Judah came to Bethel, by the word of Yahweh, while Jeroboam was standing at the altar to offer incense. 2 Then he proclaimed against the altar by the word of Yahweh and said, “O altar, altar, thus says Yahweh: ‘Look, a son will be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones shall burn on you.’ ” 3 He gave a sign on that day, saying, “This is the sign that Yahweh has predetermined: Look, this altar will be torn apart, and the ashes that are on it will be poured out.” 4 It happened at the moment the king heard the word of the man of God that he cried out against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” But his hand which he stretched out to him was paralyzed, and he was not able to draw it back to himself. 5 Then the altar was torn apart and the ashes from the altar poured out according to the sign which the man of God had announced by the word of Yahweh. 6 Then the king responded and said to the man of God, “Please entreat the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me that my hand may return to me.” So the man of God entreated the face of Yahweh, and the hand of the king returned to him, as it was in the beginning. 7 Then the king spoke to the man of God, “Come with me to the house and refresh yourself, that I may give you a gift.” 8 Then the man of God said to the king, “Even if you give to me half of your house I will not come with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water in this place, 9 for the word of Yahweh has commanded me, saying, ‘You shall not eat bread nor drink water, and you shall not return on the way that you came.’ ” 10 So he went another way, and he did not return by the way on which he had come to Bethel. 11 Now a certain older prophet was living in Bethel, and his son came and recounted to him all of the things that the man of God had done that day in Bethel and the words he had spoken to the king, and they told them to their father. 12 Then their father asked them, “Which way did he go?” His sons had seen the way which the man of God who had come from Judah had taken. 13 Then he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it 14 and went after the man of God. He found him sitting under the oak and said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” He said, “I am.” 15 Then he said to him, “Come with me to the house and eat some food.” 16 Then he said, “I am not able to return with you or to go with you. I will not eat food nor will I drink water with you in this place. 17 For a word came to me by the word of Yahweh, ‘You shall not eat food, nor shall you drink water there. You shall not return to go by the way that you came.’ ” 18 Then he said, “I am also a prophet like you. An angel spoke to me by the word of Yahweh, saying, ‘Let him return with you to your house that he may eat food and drink water.’ ” He lied to him. 19 So he returned with him and ate food in his house and drank water. 20 Now it happened that they were sitting at the table, and the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back. 21 He proclaimed to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Because you have disobeyed the word of Yahweh and have not kept the command which Yahweh your God commanded you, 22 but you have returned and have eaten food and drank water in the place which he ordered you not to eat food nor to drink water, then your dead body shall not return to the tomb of your ancestors.’ ” 23 It happened after he ate food and drank water that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back. 24 When he left, a lion found him on the road and killed him, and his dead body was thrown on the road with the donkey standing beside it, and the lion was standing by the dead body. 25 As men were passing by and they saw the dead body thrown in the road and the lion standing beside the dead body, they came and told it in the city where the old prophet was living. 26 When the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard, he said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the mouth of Yahweh, and Yahweh has given him to the lion. He tore him in pieces and killed him according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken to him.” 27 Then he spoke to his sons, saying, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled it. 28 He went and found his dead body thrown in the road and a donkey with the lion standing beside it, but the lion had not eaten the corpse nor attacked the donkey. 29 So the prophet lifted up the corpse of the man of God and put it on the donkey and brought it back. He came to the city of the old prophet to mourn him and to bury him. 30 He put his corpse in his tomb, and they mourned over him, “Alas, my brother!” 31 It happened after he buried him that he said to his sons, “When I die, you shall bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried; you shall lay my bones beside his bones. 32 For surely, the thing which he proclaimed by the word of Yahweh against the altar which is in Bethel will happen, as it will against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria.” 33 After this event, Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but he returned and again made priests for the high places of people from all walks of life. He filled his hand with all his desire and became one of the priests of the high places himself. 34 This matter became sin in the house of Jeroboam, to make it disappear and to destroy it from the surface of the earth. 1 At that time, Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill. 2 Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please get up and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Look, Ahijah the prophet is there, and he spoke concerning me before I became king over this people. 3 You must take ten loaves of bread in your hand and cakes and a jar of honey, and you must go to him. He shall tell you what will happen to the boy.” 4 The wife of Jeroboam did so. She got up, went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah was not able to see, for his eyes were fixed because of his old age. 5 Then Yahweh said to Ahijah, “Look, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to seek a word from you about her son, for he is ill. Thus and so you shall say to her. When she comes, she will be disguising herself.” 6 It happened at the moment Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps coming through the doorway, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why are you making yourself unrecognizable? I have been sent a hard message for you: 7 Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: “Because I raised you from the midst of the people and I made you leader over my people Israel, 8 I tore the kingdom from the house of David and I gave it to you. But you were not like my servant David who kept my commandments, and who went after me with all his heart, to do only what is right in my eyes. 9 But you did more evil than all who were before you. You have gone and made for yourself other gods and molten idols to provoke me, but me you have completely disregarded. 10 Therefore, look, I am about to bring disaster upon the house of Jeroboam, and I will cut off males from Jeroboam, bond or free, in Israel. I will burn after the house of Jeroboam as one burns after the manure, until it is finished. 11 The one belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city, the dogs will eat. The one who dies in the open field, the birds of the heavens will eat, for Yahweh has spoken it.” ’ 12 As for you, get up. Go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child will die. 13 All of Israel will mourn for him, and they will bury him. This one alone will come to a tomb for Jeroboam, because a good thing has been found in him by Yahweh the God of Israel in the house of Israel. 14 Yahweh will raise up a king for himself over Israel who will even now cut off the house of Jeroboam this day. 15 Yahweh will strike Israel as one shakes the reed plant in the water, and he will root Israel up from this good land that he gave to their ancestors. He will scatter them beyond the River because they have made their sacred poles which are provoking Yahweh. 16 He will give up Israel because of the sin of Jeroboam which he sinned and which he caused Israel to sin.” 17 Then the wife of Jeroboam got up, went, and came to Tirzah. As she was coming to the threshold of the house, the boy died. 18 They buried him and all of Israel mourned for him, according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet. 19 The remainder of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel. 20 The days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years, and he slept with his ancestors. Then Nadab his son became king in place of him. 21 Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which, from all of the tribes of Israel, Yahweh chose to place his name. And the name of his mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. 22 But Judah did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and they annoyed him more than their fathers did with their sins that they had committed. 23 They also built for themselves high places and stone pillars and sacred poles on every high hill and under every green tree. 24 There were also male shrine prostitutes in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh had driven out from before the Israelites. 25 It happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, 26 and he took the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and he took all the treasures of the king’s house. He took the small gold shields that Solomon had made, 27 so King Rehoboam made small copper shields in place of them and entrusted them to the commanders of the royal guard who keep the doorway of the king’s house. 28 Whenever the king came to the house of Yahweh, the royal guard carried them and brought them back to the alcove room of the royal guard. 29 The remainder of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 30 There was always war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. 31 Then Rehoboam slept with his ancestors, and he was buried with his ancestors in the city of David. The name of his mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam his son became king in his place.

1 Kings,"30 But Ahab son of Omri did evil in the eyes of Yahweh more than all who were before him. 31 If it wasn’t enough that he went after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he also took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal the king of the Sidonians. He went and served Baal and bowed down to him. 32 And he built an altar to Baal in the house of Baal which he had built in Samaria. 33 Ahab also made the sacred pole, and he continued to provoke Yahweh the God of Israel more than all the kings of Israel who were before him. 34 In his days, Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho; at the cost of Abiram his firstborn he laid its foundation, and at the cost of Segub his younger sibling, he set up its gates, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of Joshua the son of Nun. 1 Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead said to Ahab, “As Yahweh lives, the God of Israel before whom I stand, there shall surely not be dew nor rain these years except by my command.” 2 Then the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 3 “Go from this place and turn to the east; you must hide yourself in the Wadi Kerith which faces the Jordan. 4 It shall be that you shall drink from the wadi, and I have commanded the crows to sustain you there.” 5 So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh. He went and stayed in the Wadi Kerith which faces the Jordan. 6 The crows were bringing bread and meat in the morning for him and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the wadi. 7 It happened after a while that the wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land. 8 Then the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 9 “Get up and go to Zarephath which belongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman there, a widow, to sustain you.” 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath and came to the gate of the city. There was a widow woman gathering wood, so he called to her, and he said, “Please bring a little water for me in a vessel so that I can drink.” 11 She went to fetch it, and he called to her and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” 12 She said, “As Yahweh your God lives, surely I do not have a cake, but only a handful of flour in the jar and a little olive oil in the jug. Here I am gathering a few pieces of wood, and I will go and prepare it for me and my son, that we might eat it and die.” 13 Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do according to your word; only make for me a small bread cake from it first, and bring it out to me. Make it for yourself and for your son afterward. 14 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘The jar of flour will not be emptied and the jug of olive oil will not run out until the day Yahweh gives rain on the surface of the earth.’ ” 15 So she went and did according to the word of Elijah; then both she and he ate with her household for many days. 16 The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive oil did not run out, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of Elijah. 17 It happened after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill; and his illness was very severe until there was no breath left in him. 18 She said to Elijah, “What do you have against me, O man of God, that you have come to me to make known my guilt and to cause my son to die?” 19 Then he said to her, “Give me your son.” He took him from her lap and carried him up to the upper room where he was staying, and he laid him on his bed. 20 Then he called to Yahweh and said, “O Yahweh my God, are you also causing evil to come upon the widow with whom I am dwelling as an alien by causing her son to die?” 21 He stretched himself out on the child three times and called to Yahweh and said, “O Yahweh my God, please let the life of this child return within him.” 22 Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah, and the life of the child returned within him, and he lived. 23 Elijah then took the child and brought him down from the upper room to the house and gave him to his mother. Elijah said, “Look, your son is alive.” 24 Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now this I know, that you are a man of God and the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth.” 1 It happened many days later that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah in the third year, saying, “Go, present yourself to Ahab so that I may give rain on the surface of the earth.” 2 So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. 3 Ahab summoned Obadiah who was over the house. (Now Obadiah was fearing Yahweh greatly. 4 It had happened that when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in the cave and sustained them with food and water.) 5 Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the wadis. Perhaps we may find green grass that we may keep horses and mules alive and that we might not lose any of the animals.” 6 So they divided the land for themselves in order to pass through it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. 7 It happened that Obadiah was on the way, and suddenly Elijah was there to meet him. When he recognized him, he fell on his face and said, “Is this you, my lord Elijah?” 8 He said to him, “I am. Go, say to your lord, ‘Elijah is here.’ ” 9 He said, “How have I sinned that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ahab to kill me? 10 As Yahweh your God lives, surely there is not a nation or a kingdom to which my lord has not sent me to seek you. If they would say, ‘He is not here,’ then he would make the kingdom or the nation swear that it could not find you. 11 Now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your lord: “Elijah is here.” ’ 12 And it will happen that I will go from you and the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you up to where I do not know. Then I will come to tell Ahab, but he will not find you, and then he will kill me, even though your servant has feared Yahweh from my youth. 13 Has it not been told to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh? I hid a hundred men of the prophets of Yahweh by fifties in the cave, and I sustained them with food and water. 14 Now you are saying, ‘Go, say to your lord: “Elijah is here,” ’ and he will kill me.” 15 Elijah said, “As Yahweh of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will certainly show myself to him today.” 16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and he told him, so Ahab went to meet Elijah. 17 When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is this you who throws Israel into confusion?” ",1 Kings 16:30-18:17,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-kings-16301817-14230/direct-download/tbd20071017.mp3
1 Kings,"1 Then Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. 2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “Thus may the gods do to me, and may they add to it, surely at this time tomorrow I will make your life as the life of one of them!” 3 Then he became afraid, got up, and fled for his life. He came to Beersheba which belongs to Judah, and he left his servant there. 4 Then he went into the wilderness one day’s journey, and he went and sat under a certain broom tree. Then he asked Yahweh that he might die, and he said, “It is enough now, Yahweh; take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors.” 5 He lay down and fell asleep under a certain broom tree, and suddenly this angel was touching him and said to him, “Get up, eat!” 6 He looked, and behold, a bread cake on hot coals was near his head and a jar of water, so he ate and drank. Then he did it again and lay down. 7 The angel of Yahweh appeared a second time and touched him and said, “Get up, eat, for the journey is greater than you.” 8 So he got up, ate, drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights up to Horeb, the mountain of God. 9 He came to the cave there and spent the night there. Suddenly the word of Yahweh came to him and asked him, “Elijah, what are you doing here?” 10 Then he said, “I have been very zealous for Yahweh the God of hosts, for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant. They have demolished your altars, and they have killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left over, and they seek to take my life. 11 He said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before Yahweh.” Suddenly Yahweh was passing by, with a great and strong wind ripping the mountains and crushing rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh was not in the wind. After the wind, there was an earthquake; but Yahweh was not in the earthquake. 12 After the earthquake was a fire, but Yahweh was not in the fire. After the fire there was the sound of a gentle whisper. 13 It happened at the moment Elijah heard, he covered his face with his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Suddenly a voice came to him and said, “Elijah, why are you here?” 14 He said, “I have been very zealous for Yahweh the God of Hosts, for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, demolished your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword; I alone am left, and they seek to take my life!” 15 Then Yahweh said to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. Go and anoint Hazael as king over Aram; 16 and Jehu son of Nimshi you shall anoint as king over Israel. You shall also anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-Meholah as prophet in your place. 17 It shall be that the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall kill. 18 I will leave in Israel seven thousand, all of the knees that have not bowed down to Baal and all of the mouths that have not kissed him.” 19 So he went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat while he was plowing with twelve pairs of oxen before him. When he and the twelve passed Elijah, he threw his cloak on him. 20 Then he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, “Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will go after you.” Then he said, “Go, return, for what I have done to you?” 21 So he returned from after him, and he took a pair of oxen and slaughtered them, and with the yoke of the oxen he boiled the flesh and gave it to the people and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and served him. 1 Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathered all of his army, and thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots. He went up and laid siege against Samaria and fought with it. 2 He sent messengers to the city to Ahab king of Israel. 3 He said to him, “Thus says Ben-Hadad: ‘Your silver and your gold are mine, and your women and your best sons are mine.’ ” 4 Then the king of Israel answered and said, “As your word, my master the king; I am yours, and all that is mine is yours.” 5 The messengers returned and said, “Thus says Ben-Hadad, saying, ‘I sent to you saying, “Your silver and gold are mine, and your women and your best sons you must give to me.” 6 So at this time tomorrow, I will send my servants to you that they might search your house and the houses of your servants. All the desire of your eyes they will lay hands on and take it away.’ ” 7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, “Please know and realize that this man is seeking trouble, for he sent to me for my women, my sons, my silver, and my gold, and I did not withhold anything from him.” 8 All of the elders and all of the people said to him, “Do not listen and do not consent.” 9 So he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, “Say to my lord the king, ‘All that you demanded from your servant at the first, I will do, but this thing I am not able to do.’ ” Then the messengers went and made a report to him. 10 Then Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, “Thus may the gods do to me and thus may they add if the dust of Samaria is sufficient for the hollow of a hand for all of the people who are at my feet.” 11 The king of Israel answered and said, “Tell him, ‘Let not him who girds on his armor boast as one who takes off his armor.’ ” 12 It happened at the moment he heard this word, he and the kings were drinking in the tents. He said to his servants, “Get ready to attack.” So they got ready to attack the city. 13 Suddenly a certain prophet approached Ahab king of Israel and said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Have you seen all this great crowd? Behold, I am giving it into your hand today, that you may know that I am Yahweh.’ ” 14 Ahab said, “By whom?” And he said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘By the servants of the commanders of the provinces.’ ” He asked, “Who will begin the battle?” And he said, “You.” 15 So he mustered the servants of the commanders of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two. After them he mustered all of the army, all the sons of Israel, seven thousand. 16 They went out at noon while Ben-Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the tents, he and the thirty-two kings helping him. 17 Then the servants of the commanders of the provinces went out first, and Ben-Hadad sent, and they reported to him, saying, “Men have come out from Samaria.” 18 Then he said, “If they have come out for peace, seize them alive; and if they have come out for war, seize them alive.” 19 But these had come out from the city, the servants of the commanders of the provinces, and the army that was after them. 20 Each man killed his man, and the Arameans fled, so Israel pursued them, but Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with cavalry. 21 The king of Israel went out and attacked the horses and the chariots and defeated Aram with a great blow. 22 Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and he said to him, “Go, strengthen yourself; consider well what you should do, for the king of Aram is coming against you at the turn of the year.” 23 The servants of the king of Aram said to him, “Their gods are gods of the mountains, therefore they were stronger than we. Let us fight with them in the plain; surely we will be stronger than they. 24 Do this thing: remove the kings each from his post, and put a governor in their place. 25 You must muster an army for yourself as the army you have lost, and horses and chariots as the horses and chariots you lost, then we will fight them in the plain. Surely we will be stronger than they.” So he listened to their voice and did so. 26 It happened at the turning of the year that Ben-Hadad mustered Aram and went up to Aphek for the war with Israel. 27 The Israelites had been mustered and provisioned, and they went to engage them. The Israelites encamped opposite them as two flocks of goats, but the Arameans filled the land. 28 Then the man of God approached, and he spoke to the king of Israel, and he said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Because Aram has said, “Yahweh is a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys,” ’ I will give all this great crowd into your hand that you may know that I am Yahweh.” 29 These encamped opposite for seven days, and it happened on the seventh day that the battle began, and the Israelites killed the Arameans, one hundred thousand infantry in one day. 30 Then those who remained fled to Aphek, to the city, and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who had remained, so Ben-Hadad fled and went to the innermost rooms of the city. 31 Then his servants said to him, “Please now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are kings of mercy. Let us now put sackcloth on around our waists and ropes on our heads. Then let us go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will let you live.” 32 So they tied sackcloth around their waists and ropes on their heads. Then they went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’ ” And he said, “Is my brother still alive?” 33 The men took this as a good omen and they quickly accepted it as true from him, and they said, “Your brother Ben-Hadad lives.” So he said, “Go, get him.” Ben-Hadad came out to him, and Ahab pulled him up on the chariot. 34 Ben-Hadad said to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I shall return. You may set up streets with stalls for yourself in Damascus just as my father set up in Samaria.” Then Ahab said, “On these terms I will let you go,” So he made a covenant with him and let him go. 35 A certain man from the sons of the prophets said to his fellow countryman, “By the word of Yahweh, please strike me.” But the man refused to strike him. 36 He said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, look, as you now are going from me, a lion will kill you.” When he went from beside him, the lion found him and killed him. 37 Then he found another man and said, “Strike me, please,” so the man struck him sharply and wounded him. 38 Then the prophet went and waited for the king along the road and disguised himself with a headband over his eyes. 39 As the king was passing by, he called to the king and said, “Your servant went out in the thick of the battle, and suddenly a man turned and brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man. If by any means he should be missed, it will be your life in his place, or you shall pay a talent of silver.’ 40 It happened that your servant was busy here and there, and he disappeared.” Then the king of Israel said to him, “Your own judgment has been determined.” 41 He quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was from the prophets. 42 He said to him, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Because you have let the man I devoted for destruction go from your hand, your life shall be in place of his life and your people in place of his people.’ ” 43 Then the king of Israel went to his house, sullen and angry, and he came to Samaria.

1 Kings,"1 It happened after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 2 Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard that it may be mine for a garden of vegetable plants, because it is near, beside my house, and I will give to you a better vineyard in place of it. If it is better in your eyes, I will give you the money of its price.” 3 Naboth said to Ahab, “Far be it from me from Yahweh that I should give the inheritance of my ancestors to you.” 4 Then Ahab went to his house, sullen and angry because of the word that Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him when he had said, “I will not give to you the inheritance of my ancestors.” So he lay on his bed, turned away his face, and would not eat any food. 5 Then Jezebel his wife came to him, and she said to him, “What is this, that your spirit is sullen and you are not eating food?” 6 Then he said to her, “When I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and asked him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money, or if you prefer, I will give you a vineyard in place of it,’ he said, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’ ” 7 Jezebel his wife said to him, “Now, you rule over Israel. Get up, eat food, and let your heart be cheerful. I myself will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.” 8 So she wrote letters in the name of Ahab and sealed them with his seal. She sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who were dwelling with Naboth in his city. 9 She had written in the letters, saying, “Call a fast and seat Naboth at the head of the people. 10 Seat two men, scoundrels, opposite him. Let them witness against him saying, ‘You cursed God and the king.’ Then you shall bring him out and stone him so that he dies.” 11 The men of his city and the elders and nobles who were living in his city did according to what Jezebel had sent to them, as was written in the letters which she had sent to them. 12 They called a fast, and they seated Naboth at the head of the people. 13 Then the two men, scoundrels, came, sat opposite him, and the scoundrels witnessed against Naboth before the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king,” so they brought him outside of the city and stoned him with stones, and he died. 14 They sent to Jezebel saying, “Naboth has been stoned, and he is dead.” 15 It happened at the moment Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and died, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Get up, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite which he had refused to give to you for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” 16 When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it. 17 The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 18 “Arise, go down to meet Ahab the king of Israel who is in Samaria. Look in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession of it. 19 You shall say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Have you committed murder and also taken possession?” ’ You shall also say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth, the dogs will also lick your blood.” ’ ” 20 Then Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, my enemy?” He said, “I have found you because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of Yahweh. 21 ‘Look, I am bringing disaster on you, and I will sweep away after you. I will cut off for Ahab every male in Israel, bond or free. 22 I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because you made me angry and have caused Israel to sin.’ 23 Moreover, concerning Jezebel, Yahweh has said, ‘The dogs will eat Jezebel in the outer rampart of Jezreel.’ 24 The one belonging to Ahab who dies in the city, the dogs will eat; and the one who dies in the open country, the birds of the heavens will eat.” 25 Truly, there was no one like Ahab who had sold himself by doing evil in the eyes of Yahweh, whose wife Jezebel urged him on. 26 Also, he acted very abominably by going after idols like all the Amorites had done whom Yahweh had driven out from before the Israelites.” 27 When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes and put sackcloth over his flesh, fasted, lay in the sackcloth, and went about dejectedly. 28 Then the word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 29 “Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring disaster in his days. I will bring the disaster on his house in the days of his son.” 1 They lived three years, and there was no war between Aram and Israel. 2 It happened in the third year, Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to the king of Israel, 3 and the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know Ramoth-Gilead belongs to us, and we are doing nothing about taking it from the hand of the king of Aram?” 4 Then he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to the battle for Ramoth-Gilead?” Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am like you; my people are like your people; my horses are like your horses.” 5 Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire for the word of Yahweh today.” 6 Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and he said to them, “Shall I go against Ramoth-Gilead for the battle, or should I refrain?” Then they said, “Go up, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.” 7 So Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no prophet of Yahweh here that we might still inquire from him?” 8 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man to inquire of Yahweh through him, but I despise him, for he never prophesies anything good concerning me, but only bad: Micaiah the son of Imlah.” Then Jehoshaphat said, “The king should not say so.” 9 The king of Israel summoned a certain court official, and he said, “Quickly fetch Micaiah son of Imlah.” 10 The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were each sitting on his throne, dressed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them. 11 Zedekiah son of Kenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until finishing them.’ ” 12 All of the prophets were likewise prophesying, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-Gilead and triumph, and Yahweh will give it into the hand of the king.” 13 Then the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Please now, the words of the prophets are unanimously favorable to the king. Please let your words be as one word with them, and speak favorably.” 14 Then Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives, surely only as Yahweh speaks to me, that will I speak.” 15 When he came to the king, the king asked him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to the battle, or shall we refrain?” He said to him, “Go up and triumph, and Yahweh will give it into the hand of the king.” 16 Then the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear that you shall not tell me anything but truth in the name of Yahweh?” 17 So he said, “I saw all of Israel scattering to the mountains, like the sheep without a shepherd. Yahweh also said, ‘There are no masters for these, let them return in peace, each to his house.’ ” 18 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not say to you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but disaster?” 19 And he said, “Therefore, hear the word of Yahweh. I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne with all the hosts of heaven standing beside him from his right hand and from his left hand. 20 And Yahweh said, ‘Who will entice Ahab so that he will go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead?’ Then this one was saying one thing and the other one was saying another. 21 Then a spirit came out and stood before Yahweh and said, ‘I will entice him,’ and Yahweh said to him, ‘How?’ 22 He said, ‘I will go out and I will be a false spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he said, ‘You shall entice and succeed, go out and do so.’ 23 So then, see that Yahweh has placed a false spirit in the mouth of all of these your prophets, and Yahweh has spoken disaster concerning you.” 24 Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah came near and slapped Micaiah on the cheek and said, “When did the Spirit of Yahweh pass from me to speak with you?” 25 Then Micaiah said, “Behold, you are about to see on that day when you go from room to room to hide.” 26 The king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the commander of the city and to Jehoash the son of the king; 27 and say, ‘Thus says the king: “Put this fellow in the house of imprisonment and feed him reduced rations of food and water until I come in peace.” ’ ” 28 Then Micaiah said, “If you indeed return in peace, then Yahweh has not spoken with me.” Then he said, “Let all the peoples hear!” 29 Then the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-Gilead. 30 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you wear your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and he went into the battle. 31 The king of Aram commanded his thirty-two chariot commanders, saying, “You shall not fight with small or great, but only against the king of Israel, him alone!” 32 When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely he is the king of Israel,” and they turned to fight against him, so Jehoshaphat called out. 33 When the chariot commanders saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him. 34 But another man drew his bow fully and struck the king of Israel between the armor scales and the breastplate; so he said to his chariot driver, “Turn the chariot and bring me out from the camp, for I am wounded.” 35 The battle intensified on that day, and the king was being propped up in the chariot opposite Aram, but he died in the evening, and the blood of the wound ran out to the floor of the chariot. 36 Then the shout passed through the camp about sunset, saying, “Each man to his city and each to his land!” 37 So the king died, and they brought him to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria. 38 They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked his blood (now, the prostitutes washed themselves there) according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken.

1 Kings,"30 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you wear your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and he went into the battle. 31 The king of Aram commanded his thirty-two chariot commanders, saying, “You shall not fight with small or great, but only against the king of Israel, him alone!” 32 When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely he is the king of Israel,” and they turned to fight against him, so Jehoshaphat called out. 33 When the chariot commanders saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him. 34 But another man drew his bow fully and struck the king of Israel between the armor scales and the breastplate; so he said to his chariot driver, “Turn the chariot and bring me out from the camp, for I am wounded.” 35 The battle intensified on that day, and the king was being propped up in the chariot opposite Aram, but he died in the evening, and the blood of the wound ran out to the floor of the chariot. 36 Then the shout passed through the camp about sunset, saying, “Each man to his city and each to his land!” 37 So the king died, and they brought him to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria. 38 They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked his blood (now, the prostitutes washed themselves there) according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken. 39 The remainder of the acts of Ahab and all that he did, and the ivory palace and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 40 So Ahab slept with his ancestors, and Ahaziah his son became king in his place. 41 Jehoshaphat the son of Asa became king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 42 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 43 He walked in all of the way of Asa his father, and he did not turn aside from it, doing right in the eyes of Yahweh. Only he did not remove the high places; the people were still sacrificing and burning incense on the high places. 44 But, Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 45 The remainder of the acts of Jehoshaphat, his powerful deeds he did, and how he fought, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 46 The remainder of the male shrine prostitutes who were left over in the days of Asa his father he exterminated from the land. 47 There was not a king in Edom; a governor served as king. 48 Jehoshaphat built ships of the Tarshish type to go to Ophir for the gold; but he did not go because the ships were destroyed at Ezion-Geber. 49 Then Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships,” but Jehoshaphat was not willing. 50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David his ancestor, and Joram his son became king in his place. 51 Ahaziah son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. 52 He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and he went in the way of his father and his mother and in the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat who caused Israel to sin. 53 He served Baal and bowed down to him; and he provoked Yahweh the God of Israel according to all that his father did. 1 Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. 2 Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice in his upper room, which was in Samaria, and he was injured. So he sent messengers, and he said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, if I will survive this injury.” 3 Then the angel of Yahweh spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, “Get up, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and speak to them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?’ 4 Therefore, thus says Yahweh, ‘The bed upon which you have gone, you will not come down from it, but you shall surely die.’ ” So Elijah went. 5 When the messengers returned to him, he asked them, “Why have you returned?” 6 Then they said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and he said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you and speak to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub the god of Ekron? Therefore the bed upon which you have gone, you will not come down from it, for you will surely die.’ ” ’ ” 7 Then he spoke to them, “What was the manner of the man who came up to meet you and spoke to you all these things?” 8 They answered him, “A hairy man with a leather belt girded around his waist.” And he said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.” 9 So Ahaziah sent to him the commander of fifty with his fifty men, and he went up to him while he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, “O man of God, the king says, ‘Come down.’ ” 10 Then Elijah answered and said to the commander of the fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. 11 So he again sent another commander of fifty and his fifty men. He answered and said to him, “O man of God, thus says the king, ‘Come down quickly!’ ” 12 Then Elijah answered and said to them, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty!” Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. 13 So he again sent a third time a commander of fifty and his fifty, and the commander of the third fifty went up and came and knelt down on his knees before Elijah and entreated him. He said to him, “O man of God, please let my life and the lives of your servants, these fifty, be precious in your eyes. 14 Behold, fire from heaven came down and consumed the first two commanders of fifty and their fifties, so then let my life be precious in your eyes.” 15 Then the angel of Yahweh spoke to Elijah, “Go down with him. Do not be afraid because of him.” So he got up and went down with him to the king, 16 and he said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron—is it because there is no God in Israel from whom to inquire his word?—therefore the bed upon which you went, you shall not come down from it, for you shall surely die.’ ” 17 So he died, according to the word of Yahweh that Elijah had spoken, and Joram became king in his place in the second year of Joram the son of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, because he had no son. 18 The remainder of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 1 When Yahweh was about to take Elijah up in the storm to heaven, Elijah and Elisha went from Gilgal. 2 Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for Yahweh has sent me up to Bethel.” Elisha said, “As Yahweh lives and as your soul lives, I will certainly not leave you!” So they went down to Bethel. 3 Then the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha, and they said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh is going to take your master from you today?” He said, “I also know; be quiet!” 4 Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please stay here because Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.” And he said, “As Yahweh lives and as your soul lives, I will certainly not leave you!” So they came to Jericho. 5 Then the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho came near to Elisha, and they said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh is going to take your master from you today?” He said, “I also know; be quiet!” 6 Then Elijah said to him, “Please stay here, because Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan.” He said, “As Yahweh lives and as your soul lives, I will certainly not leave you!” So the two of them went on. 7 Then fifty men from the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite them at a distance while the two of them stood by the Jordan. 8 Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water. It divided in two, and the two of them crossed over on dry land. 9 After they crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I may do for you before I am taken away from you.” Then Elisha said, “Please let there come to me a double portion of your spirit.” 10 He said, “What you ask is difficult. If you see me being taken from you, it will be so for you, but if not, it will not happen.” 11 Then they were walking, talking as they went. Suddenly a fiery chariot with horses of fire appeared and separated between the two of them. Elijah went up in the storm to the heavens 12 while Elisha was watching and crying out, “My father, my father; the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!” But he could not see him any longer, and he grasped his clothes and tore them in two pieces. 13 Then he picked up Elijah’s cloak that had fallen off of him, and he returned and stood on the bank of the Jordan. 14 He took Elijah’s cloak that had fallen from upon him and struck the water. Then he said, “Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?” So he also struck the water, and it divided in two, and Elisha crossed over. 15 When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him from the other side, they declared, “The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha,” and they came to meet him and bowed down to him to the ground. 16 Then they said to him, “Look, there are with your servants fifty able men. Please let them go and look for your master, lest the Spirit of Yahweh has lifted him up and thrown him on one of the mountains or into one of the valleys,” but he said, “You must not send them.” 17 But they urged him until embarrassing him, so he said, “Send them.” So they sent fifty men, and they looked for three days, but they could not find him. 18 Then they returned to him while he was staying in Jericho. He said to them, “Did I not tell you not to go?” 19 The men of the city said to Elisha, “Please now, the location of the city is good, as my master can see, but the water is bad and the land unproductive.” 20 So he said, “Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him. 21 Then he went out to the spring of waters and threw the salt into it there and said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘I hereby purify these waters; let there be no longer any death or unproductiveness from it.’ ” 22 Then the waters were purified until this very day according to the word of Elisha that he spoke.

2 Kings,"23 Then he went up from there to Bethel; as he was going up along the way, young boys came out from the city and mocked at him and said to him, “Go up, baldhead; go up, baldhead!” 24 When he turned around and saw them, he cursed them in the name of Yahweh. Then two bears came out of the forest and mauled forty-two boys among them. 25 Then he went from there to Mount Carmel and from there he returned to Samaria. 1 Now Joram the son of Ahab had become king over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah. He reigned twelve years 2 and did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, yet not as his father or his mother, as he removed the stone pillars of Baal that his father had made. 3 But he did cling to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who caused Israel to sin, and he did not depart from it. 4 Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and he used to deliver to the king of Israel a hundred thousand male lambs and a hundred thousand wool rams. 5 It happened that when Ahab died, Mesha king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 6 So King Joram went out on that day from Samaria, and he mustered all of Israel. 7 He went and sent a message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab for the battle?” And he said, “I will go up. I am like you; my people are like your people; my horses are like your horses.” 8 Then he said, “Which way shall we go up?” And he answered, “By way of the wilderness of Edom.” 9 So the king of Israel and the king of Judah and the king of Edom went around, a way of seven days, but there was no water for the army or for the animals that were with them. 10 Then the king of Israel said, “Aha, Yahweh has called for these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.” 11 Then Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of Yahweh here that we might inquire of Yahweh from him?” One of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, “Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.” 12 Jehoshaphat said, “The word of Yahweh is with him.” So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him. 13 Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What do we have in common? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother.” Then the king of Israel said to him, “No, for Yahweh has called for these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.” 14 Then Elisha said, “As Yahweh of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely if I was not regarding the face of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would have not looked at you nor even glanced at you. 15 But now, bring me a musician.” It happened that at the moment the musician played, the hand of Yahweh came upon him. 16 He said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Make this wadi full of cisterns,’ 17 for thus says Yahweh, ‘You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this wadi will be full of water; and you and all of your livestock and your animals shall drink.’ 18 And since this is too trivial in the eyes of Yahweh, he will also give Moab into your hand, 19 and you shall defeat every fortified city, every choice city, and you shall fell every good tree. All of the springs of water you shall stop up, and every tract of good land you shall ruin with the stones.” 20 It happened in the morning about the time of the morning offering, that water was suddenly coming from the direction of Edom and the land was filled with water. 21 Now all of Moab had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, and all who were fighting age and up were called up, and they stood at the border. 22 When they arose early in the morning, the sun shone on the waters, and Moab saw the waters from the opposite side as red as blood. 23 Then they said, “This is blood! Certainly the kings have fought one another, and each has killed his neighbor. Now, to the war booty, O Moab!” 24 But when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel stood up and killed Moab, so that they fled from before them. They came at her and defeated Moab. 25 The cities they tore down, on every good tract of land they threw stones until it was filled up, every spring of water they stopped up, and every good tree they felled. They let the stone walls at Kir Hareseth remain, but the slingers surrounded and attacked it. 26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too heavy for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew the sword to break through to the king of Edom, but they were not able. 27 He took his firstborn son who was to become king in his place and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. Great wrath came upon Israel, and they withdrew from him and returned to the land. 1 A certain woman from the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead. Now you know that your servant was a fearer of Yahweh, but the creditor came to take two of my children for himself as slaves. 2 Elisha asked her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” Then she said, “Your servant has nothing in the house except a jar of olive oil.” 3 Then he said to her, “Go, ask for yourself some containers from the streets, from all your neighbors. You must collect as many empty containers as you can! 4 You must also go and shut the door behind you and your children, and you must pour out oil into all of these containers and set the filled ones aside.” 5 So she went from him, and she shut the door behind her and her children. They were bringing containers to her, and she kept pouring. 6 It happened that when the containers were full, she said to her son, “Bring near me another container,” but he said to her, “There is not another container.” Then the olive oil stopped flowing. 7 So she came and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the olive oil and repay your debt. You and your sons can live on what is left over.” 8 It happened one day that Elisha passed through to Shunem where there was a wealthy woman, and she urged him to eat bread; so it happened each time he passed through, he would stop there to eat. 9 She said to her husband, “Please now, I know that he is a holy man of God who is passing our way regularly; 10 let us make a small enclosed room upstairs and put a bed, table, chair, and lampstand there for him, so that when he comes to us, he can turn and stay there. 11 One day it happened that he came there and went to the upper room and lay down there. 12 He said to Gehazi his servant, “Call to this Shunammite,” so he called to her, and she stood before him. 13 He said to him, “Please say to her, ‘Look, you took all this trouble, showing care for us; what is there for me to do for you? To speak for you to the king or to the commander of the army?’ ” She said, “I am living among my people.” 14 Then he said, “What may be done for her?” Gehazi said, “Well, she has no son, and her husband is old.” 15 And he said, “Call for her,” so he called for her and she stood in the doorway. 16 And he said, “At this time next spring, you will be embracing a son.” She said, “No, my lord, O man of God! You must not tell a lie to your servant!” 17 But the woman conceived, and she bore a son in the spring, which Elisha had promised to her. 18 The child grew older, and it happened one day that he went out to his father and to the reapers. 19 Then he said to his father, “My head, my head!” So he said to the servant, “Carry him to his mother.” 20 So they carried him and brought him to his mother; he sat on her lap until noon and then died. 21 She went up, laid him on the bed of the man of God, closed the door, and went out behind it. 22 She called to her husband and said, “Please send one of the servants and one of the female donkeys for me, so that I can go quickly up to the man of God and return.” 23 And he said, “Why are you going to him today? It is neither the new moon nor the Sabbath!” And she said, “Peace.” 24 She saddled the female donkey, and she said to her servant, “Drive along and go; you must not hold me back from riding, unless I tell you.” 25 So she went and came to the man of God by Mount Carmel. It happened when the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to Gehazi his servant, “There is this Shunammite. 26 Now, please run to meet her and ask her, ‘Is it peace for you? Is it peace for your husband? Is it peace for the boy?’ ” She said, “Peace.” 27 So she came to the man of God at the mountain, and she caught hold of his feet. Then Gehazi came near to push her away, but the man of God said, “Let her alone, for her soul is bitter, and Yahweh has hidden it from me and has not told me.” 28 Then she said, “Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say that you must not mislead me?” 29 Then he said to Gehazi, “Gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand and go. If you meet anyone, you must not greet them; if anyone greets you, you must not answer them. You must put my staff on the face of the boy.” 30 Then the mother of the boy said, “As Yahweh lives and as your soul lives, I will surely not leave you.” So he got up and went after her. 31 Gehazi crossed over before them, and he put the staff on the face of the boy; but there was no sound, and there was no sign of life, so he returned to meet him. He told him, saying, “The boy did not wake up.” 32 When Elisha came to the house, here was the boy dead, lying on his bed. 33 He went and closed the door behind the two of them and prayed to Yahweh. 34 Then he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his palms on his palms. As he bent down over him, the flesh of the boy became warm. 35 He returned and went to and fro in the house one time, then he went up and bent over him. Then the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes. 36 Elisha called to Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite.” So he called her and she came to him; then he said, “Pick up your son.” 37 She came and fell at his feet and bowed down to the ground; then she picked up her son and went out. 38 So Elisha returned to Gilgal. Now the famine was in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. He said to his servant, put on the large pot and cook a stew for the sons of the prophets. 39 One went out to the field to gather herbs, and he found a wild vine and gathered wild gourds from it and filled his cloak. Then he came and cut them into the pot of stew, but they did not know what they were. 40 They served the men to eat, but when they ate from the stew, they cried out and said, “There is death in the pot, O man of God!” They were not able to eat it. 41 Then he said, “Bring some flour,” and he threw it into the pot. He then said, “Serve the people and let them eat.” There was nothing harmful in the pot. 42 A man came from Baal-Shalishah and brought food to the man of God: firstfruits and twenty loaves of barley bread, with ripe grain in his sack. He said, “Give it to the people and let them eat.” 43 Then his servant said, “How can I set this before a hundred men?” He said, “Give it to the people and let them eat, for thus Yahweh says, ‘They shall eat and have some left over.’ ” 44 So he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of Yahweh.

2 Kings,"1 Now Naaman was the commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man before his master and highly regarded, for by him Yahweh had given victory to Aram. Now the man was a mighty warrior, but he was afflicted with a skin disease. 2 When the Arameans went on a raid, they brought back a young girl from the land of Israel, and she came into the service of the wife of Naaman. 3 She said to her mistress, “If only my lord would come before the prophet who is in Samaria; then he would cure his skin disease.” 4 He came and told his master, saying, “Thus and so the girl who is from the land of Israel said.” 5 So the king of Aram said, “Go, I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” He went and took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of clothing. 6 So he brought the letter to the king to Israel, saying, “Now, when this letter comes to you, I have just sent Naaman my servant to you that you may cure him from his skin disease.” 7 It happened that when the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, “Am I God to cause death or to give life? This man is sending a man to me to cure his disease. Indeed! But know and see that he seeks an opportunity against me.” 8 It happened that as soon as Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, “Why did you tear your clothes? Please may he come to me, that he might know that there is a prophet in Israel.” 9 Then Naaman came with his horses and his chariots, and he stopped at the doorway of the house of Elisha. 10 Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go, you must wash seven times in the Jordan, then your flesh shall return to you, and you shall be clean.” 11 But Naaman became angry and he went and said, “Look, I said to myself, ‘Surely he will come out, stand, call upon the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hands over the spot; then he would take away the skin disease.’ 12 Are not the Abana and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all of the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them that I may be clean?” Then he turned and left in anger. 13 But his servants came near and spoke to him and said, “My father, if the prophet had spoken a difficult thing to you to do, would you not have done it? Why not even when he says to you, ‘Wash and you shall be clean’?” 14 So he went down and plunged into the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh returned as the flesh of a small boy, and he was clean. 15 When he returned to the man of God, he and all of his army, he came and stood before him and said, “Please now, I know that there is no God in all of the world except in Israel. So then, please take a gift from your servant.” 16 And he said, “As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I surely will not take it.” Still he urged him to take it, but he refused. 17 Then Naaman said, “If not, then please let a load of soil on a pair of mules be given to your servants, for your servant will never again bring a burnt offering and sacrifice to other gods, but only to Yahweh. 18 As far as this matter, may Yahweh pardon your servant when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he is leaning himself on my arm, that I also bow down in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh please pardon your servant in this matter.” 19 He said to him, “Go in peace,” so he went from him a short distance. 20 But Gehazi the servant of Elisha, the man of God, thought, “Look, my master has refrained from taking what this Aramean Naaman brought from his hand. As Yahweh lives, I will certainly run after him, and I will accept something from him.” 21 So Gehazi pursued after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he jumped off his chariot to meet him and asked him, “Is it peace?” 22 He said, “Peace. My master has sent me saying, ‘Look, just now two servants from the hill country of Ephraim came to me, from the sons of the prophets. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.’ ” 23 Then Naaman said, “Be prepared to accept two talents.” So he urged him and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing and gave it to two of his servants and they carried it before him. 24 When he came to the citadel, he took them from their hand and put them in the house, then sent away the men so that they went. 25 When he went and stood by his master, Elisha asked him, “From where have you come, Gehazi?” And he said, “Your servant has not gone anywhere.” 26 Then he said to him, “Did not my heart go with you as the man turned from on his chariot to meet you? Is it time to take silver, clothes, olive orchards, vineyards, sheep, oxen, male slaves, and female slaves? 27 The skin disease of Naaman shall cling to you and to your offspring forever.” Then he went out from before him having a skin disease like the snow.

2 Kings,"1 Then the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Please look; the place where we are living before you is too cramped for us. 2 Let us please go to the Jordan and each bring from there one log that we might make a place there for us to live.” Then he said, “Do so.” 3 Then a certain one said, “Please be prepared and go with your servants,” and he said, “I will go.” 4 He went with them, and they went to the Jordan, and they cut down the trees. 5 It happened as the one was felling the log, that the iron ax fell into the water. He called out and said, “Oh, no! My master, it was borrowed!” 6 Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” So he showed him the place, and then he cut off a stick and threw it there and made the iron ax float. 7 Then he said, “Pick it up for yourself,” so he stretched out his hand and took it. 8 The king of Aram was fighting with Israel, so he consulted with his officers, saying, “My camp is at such and such a place.” 9 Then the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, “Take care while crossing over to this place, because the Arameans are descending there.” 10 So the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God said to him and warned him, so he was on guard there continually. 11 Then the heart of the king of Aram was stormy because of this matter, so he called his servants and said to them, “Can you not tell me who among us sides with the king of Israel?” 12 Then one of his servants said, “No, my lord the king, but Elisha the prophet who is in Israel tells the king of Israel things that you speak in your own bedchamber.” 13 Then he said, “Go and see where he is so that I can send and capture him.” Then he was told to him, “Look, he is in Dothan.” 14 So he sent horses, chariots, and an oppressing army there. They arrived at night and surrounded the town. 15 The attendant of the man of God arose early and went out, and look, the army was surrounding the city with horses and chariots. His servant said to him, “Oh no, my master! What shall we do?” 16 And he said, “Don’t be afraid, for more are with us than are with them.” 17 Then Elisha prayed and said, “O Yahweh, please open his eyes that he may see,” and Yahweh opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw, and look, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. 18 They came down to him, and Elisha prayed to Yahweh and said, “Please strike this people with blindness,” so he struck them with blindness as Elisha had spoken. 19 Then Elisha said to them, “This is not the way and this is not the city. Come after me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” Then he brought them to Samaria. 20 It happened at the moment they came to Samaria, Elisha said, “O Yahweh, open the eyes of these that they may see,” so Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw, and look, the middle of Samaria! 21 Then the king of Israel said to Elisha when he saw them, “Shall I kill them? Shall I kill, my father?” 22 And he said, “You shall not kill. Would you kill those whom you took captive with the sword or with the bow? Put food and water before them that they may eat and drink and then go to their master.” 23 So he made a great feast for them, and they ate and drank; then he sent them, and they went to their master. And the bands of the Arameans did not come again into the land of Israel. 24 It happened after this that Ben-Hadad king of Aram assembled all of his army and marched up and laid siege against Samaria. 25 There was a great famine in Samaria, and behold, a siege was against it, until the head of a donkey went for eighty shekels of silver, and one fourth of the measure of the dung of doves went for five shekels of silver. 26 It happened that the king of Israel was crossing over on the wall, and a woman called out to him, saying, “Help, my lord the king!” 27 He said, “No, let Yahweh help you. How can I save you? From the threshing floor or from the wine press?” 28 The king said to her, “What is the problem?” Then the woman said, “This woman said to me, ‘Give me your son, and let us eat him today, then tomorrow we will eat my son.’ 29 So we cooked my son and ate him, and I said to her the next day, ‘Give your son that we may eat him.’ But she had hidden her son.” 30 It happened that when the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. Now he had been walking on the wall, and the people saw, and behold, sackcloth was over his flesh underneath. 31 Then he said, “May God do to me and thus may he add, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today!” 32 Now Elisha was sitting in his house and the elders were sitting with him, and the king dispatched a man from before him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Did you see that this son of a murderer has sent to remove my head? Look, when the messenger comes, close the door; and you must hold the door closed against him. Is not the sound of the feet of his master behind him?” 33 While he was still speaking with them, suddenly the messenger was coming down to him, and he said, “Look this trouble is from Yahweh. Why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?” ",2 Kings 6,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/2-kings-6-14237/direct-download/tbd20071026.mp3
2 Kings,"1 Elisha said, “Hear the word of Yahweh: ‘Thus says Yahweh, “At this time tomorrow a seah of wheat bread flour will sell for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria.’ ” 2 Then the officer on whom the king relied answered the man of God and said, “Look, even if Yahweh is making windows in heaven, could this thing happen?” And he said, “Look, you will be seeing it with your eyes, but you shall not eat from it there.” 3 Now four men who had a skin disease were at the entrance of the gate, and they said to each other, “Why are we sitting here until we die? 4 If we say, ‘Let us go into the city,’ the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; but if we sit here, we shall die. So then, come, let us fall into the camp of the Arameans. If they let us live, we shall live; but if they kill us, then we shall die.” 5 So they got up at dusk to go to the camp of the Arameans. They went up to the edge of the camp of the Arameans, and look, there was no man there! 6 Now the Lord had caused the camp of the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots, the sound of horses, and the sound of a great army. So they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against us!” 7 So they got up and fled at dusk and left their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and the camp as it was, and they fled for their lives. 8 When these who had the skin disease came to the edge of the camp, they went into a certain tent and they ate, drank, and took from there silver and gold and clothes. Then they went and hid them, then returned and came to another tent, and they took from there and went and hid them. 9 Then they said to one another, “We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news! If we are silent and wait until the light of morning, we will be punished. So then, come, let us go and tell the house of the king.” 10 When they came, they called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, saying, “We came to the camp of the Arameans, and behold, there was no man or the voice of a man there! Only the horses and the donkeys were tied up, and the tents were left as they were.” 11 Then the gatekeepers called and told it inside the house of the king. 12 The king got up in the night and said to his servants, “Please let me tell you what the Arameans have done to us. The Arameans know that we are hungry, so they went out from the camp to hide in the field, saying, ‘When they go out from the city, we shall seize them alive and go into the city.’ ” 13 Then one of his servants replied and said, “Please let them take five of the remaining horses that remain in the city; behold, they are like all of the multitude of Israel that remain in it; they are like all the multitude of Israel who have perished. Let us send and see.” 14 So he took two charioteer horsemen, and the king sent after the camp of the Arameans, saying, “Go, find out,” 15 and they went after them to the Jordan. Look, all of the way was littered with clothes and equipment which the Arameans had thrown away in their haste. Then the messengers returned and told the king. 16 So the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. A seah of wheat flour went for a shekel and two seahs of barley went for a shekel according to the word of Yahweh. 17 Then the king appointed the officer he was depending on over the gate, but the people trampled him and he died, according to that which the man of God had said, which he spoke when the king came down to him. 18 It happened as the man of God spoke to the king, saying, “Two seahs of barley shall be sold for a shekel and a seah of wheat flour for a shekel at this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria.” 19 Then the officer had replied to the man of God and said, “Look, even if Yahweh is opening the windows in heaven, could this thing happen?” And he had said, “Look you are about to see it with your eyes, but you will not eat from it.” 20 So it had happened to him; the people trampled him in the gate and he died. 1 Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Get up and go, you and your household, and dwell as an alien wherever you can, for Yahweh has called for a famine, and it will come to the land for seven years.” 2 So the woman got up and did according to the word of the man of God. She and her household went and dwelt as an alien in the land of the Philistines for seven years. 3 It happened at the end of seven years that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and went out to appeal to the king for her household and for her properties. 4 Now the king was speaking to Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please tell me all of the great things that Elisha has done.” 5 It happened that as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life, suddenly the woman whose son he had restored to life was crying out to the king about her household and about her field. Then Gehazi said, “My lord the king, this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life!” 6 So the king asked the woman, and she told him. So the king appointed for her a certain court official, saying, “Restore all that is hers and all the yield of the field from the day she left the land up to now.” 7 Elisha came to Damascus. Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill, and he was told, “The man of God has come up here.” 8 Then the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift in your hand and go meet the man of God. Inquire of Yahweh from him, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this illness?’ ” 9 So Hazael went to meet him and took a gift in his hand of all of the good things of Damascus, a load on each of forty camels, and he came and stood before him. Then he said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to you, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this illness?’ ” 10 Elisha said to him, “Go; say to him, ‘You shall certainly recover,’ but Yahweh has shown me that he certainly will die.” 11 Then the man fixed his gaze and stared at him until he was ashamed and the man of God cried. 12 Then Hazael asked, “Why is my lord crying?” He said, “Because I know what evil you will do to the Israelites. You will set their fortifications on fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword. Their little ones you will dash to pieces, and their pregnant women you will rip open!” 13 Then Hazael said, “But how could your servant, who is like a dog, do this great thing?” Elisha said, “Yahweh has shown me that you are to be king over Aram.” 14 So he departed from Elisha and came to his master. He asked him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he said, “He said to me that you will certainly recover.” 15 On the next day, he took the bed cover, dipped it in the water, and spread it over his face so that he died. Then Hazael became king in his place. 16 Now in the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab, king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Joram son of Jehoshaphat became the king of Judah. 17 He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 18 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab became his wife, and he did evil in the eyes of Yahweh. 19 Yet Yahweh was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, as he had promised to give him a lamp for his sons always. 20 In his days, Edom rebelled against the rule of Judah, and they set up a king over them. 21 So Joram crossed over to Zair and all the chariots with him. It happened that he arose by night and attacked Edom who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots; but the army fled to their tents. 22 So Edom has rebelled against the rule of Judah until this day; then Libnah also rebelled at that time. 23 The remainder of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 24 So Joram slept with his ancestors, and he was buried with his ancestors in the city of David, and Ahaziah his son became king in place of him. 25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Joram became king of Judah. 26 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Athaliah daughter of Omri, king of Israel. 27 He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, as the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab. 28 He went with Joram the son of Ahab for the battle against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-Gilead, and the Arameans wounded Joram. 29 Joram the king returned to Jezreel to heal from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought with Hazael king of Aram. Ahaziah the son of Joram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, for he was ill.

2 Kings,"1 Now Elisha the prophet called for one of the sons of the prophets, and he said to him, “Gird your loins, and take this flask of olive oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead. 2 Go there and look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi. Go, for you must cause him to arise from among his brothers, and you must bring him into an inner room. 3 You must take the flask of olive oil and pour it out on his head. You must say, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “I hereby anoint you as king over Israel.” ’ Then you must open the door and flee; do not linger!” 4 So the young man, servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-Gilead. 5 He came, and look, the commanders of the army were sitting there. He said, “I have a word for you, O commander!” Jehu said, “For whom? For all of us?” And he said, “For you, O commander!” 6 He got up and went to the house, and poured the olive oil on his head and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘I hereby anoint you as king over the people of Yahweh, over Israel. 7 You will destroy the house of Ahab your master, and you will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all of the servants of Yahweh, from the hand of Jezebel. 8 All of the house of Ahab will perish, and I shall cut off all males from Ahab, both bond and free. 9 I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. 10 The dogs will eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and there shall not be anyone to bury her.’ ” Then he opened the door and fled. 11 Then Jehu came out to the officers of his master, and they said to him, “Peace? Why did this madman come to you?” And he said to them, “You know the man and his foolish talk.” 12 Then they said, “Liar. Please tell us.” He said, “Thus and so he said to me, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “I hereby anoint you as king over Israel.” ’ ” 13 So they hastened each one to take his cloak, and they spread them under him on the bare steps, blew on the trumpet, and said, “Jehu is king!” 14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram was keeping guard in Ramoth-Gilead, he and all of Israel, because of the threat of Hazael king of Aram. 15 But Joram the king had returned to heal in Jezreel from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Aram. Jehu said, “If this is what you want, do not let him go out as a fugitive from the city to go to make it known in Jezreel.” 16 Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there, and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to visit Joram. 17 Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu when he came, and he said, “I see a company.” Joram said, “Take a horseman and send him to meet them.” And he said, “Is it peace?” 18 So the rider of the horse went out to meet him, and he said, “Thus the king asks, ‘Is it peace?’ ” Then Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Turn after me.” Then the watchman reported, saying, “The messenger went up to them, but he did not return.” 19 Then he sent out a second horseman, and he came to them and said, “Thus the king asks, ‘Is it peace?’ ” Then Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Turn after me.” 20 So the sentinel reported, saying, “He went up to them, but he did not return, and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives with madness.” 21 Then Joram said, “Get ready,” so he got his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel went out, and Ahaziah king of Judah, each with his chariot. They went out to meet Jehu, and they found him at the tract of land of Naboth the Jezreelite. 22 When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, “Is it peace, Jehu?” And he said, “What peace is there while the prostitutions of your mother Jezebel and her sorceries are numerous?” 23 Joram turned his chariot and fled and said to Ahaziah, “It’s treason, Ahaziah!” 24 Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between his shoulders so that the arrow went out from his heart, and he slumped down in his chariot. 25 He said to Bidkar his third servant, “Lift him out and throw him on the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite, for remember, you and I were with the pair of chariots behind Ahab his father when Yahweh pronounced this oracle against him: 26 ‘ “Since I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his children yesterday,” declares Yahweh, “I will requite it for you in this tract of land,” declares Yahweh.’ So then lift him out and throw him on the tract of land according to the word of Yahweh.” 27 When Ahaziah king of Judah saw, he fled the way of Beth-Haggen. Jehu pursued after him and said, “Shoot him also, in the chariot.” They shot him at the ascent of Gur which is in Ibleam, and he fled to Megiddo, but he died there. 28 Then his officers carried him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the city of David. 29 In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah. 30 When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it, so she painted her eyes with black eye paint and adorned her head and looked through the window. 31 Now Jehu had come in the gate, so she said, “Is it peace, O Zimri, murderer of his master?” 32 When he lifted up his face to the window, he asked, “Who is with me?” Two or three eunuchs looked down to him. 33 So he said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down, and her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled her. 34 Then he came and ate and drank, and said, “Please take care of this cursed one and bury her, for she is the daughter of a king.” 35 When they went to bury her, they could not find her, except the skull, the feet, and the palms of the hands. 36 They returned and told him, and he said, “This is the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘On the plot of ground of Jezreel, the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel.’ ” 37 So the dead body of Jezebel became dung on the surface spread on the field in the plot of ground of Jezreel, so one cannot say, “This is Jezebel.” 1 Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria, and Jehu wrote letters, and he sent them to Samaria to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab, saying, 2 “Now, when this letter comes to you and your master’s sons are with you, the chariots are with you, the horses, a fortified city, and weapons, 3 then you must select the best and the most suitable from the sons of your master, and you must place him on the throne of his father, and they must fight for the house of your masters.” 4 But they were very afraid, and they said, “Look, two kings could not stand before him; how can we stand?” 5 So whoever was over the house, and whoever was over the city, and the elders and the guardians sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants; all that you say to us, we shall do. We shall not make anyone a king. Do what is good in your eyes.” 6 Then he wrote to them a second letter, saying, “If you are for me, and you are listening to my voice, take the heads of the men of the sons of your master and come to me at this time tomorrow at Jezreel.” Now the sons of the king, seventy men, were with the leaders of the city who were raising them. 7 When the letter came to them, they took the sons of the king, and they killed seventy men. Then they put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel. 8 Then the messenger came and told him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons,” and he said, “Put them in two piles at the entrance of the gate until morning.” 9 It happened in the morning that he went out, stood, and said to all of the people, “You are righteous. Look, I conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all of these? 10 Know then that the word of Yahweh will not fail which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab; Yahweh has done what he spoke by the hand of his servant Elijah. 11 Then Jehu killed all of the remainder of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all of his leaders, his close friends, and his priests, until there was no survivor left for him. 12 Then he arose and went and came to Samaria. On the way, he was at Beth-Eked of the shepherds, 13 and Jehu met the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah. He asked, “Who are you?” They said, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah; we came down for the peace of the king’s children and the children of the queen.” 14 Then he said, “Seize them alive!” So they seized them alive but then slaughtered them at the cistern of Beth-Eked, forty-two men. He did not allow any of them to survive. 15 Next he went from there and found Jehonadab the son of Recab to meet him. He greeted him and asked him, “Is your heart right with me as my heart is with you?” Then Jehonadab said, “Yes, it is. Give your hand!” And he gave his hand and took him up to him on the chariot. 16 Then he said, “Come with me! Look at my zeal for Yahweh!” So he let him ride in his chariot. 17 Then he came to Samaria and killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria until he wiped them out, according to the word of Yahweh that he had spoken to Elijah. 18 Then Jehu assembled all of the people and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will worship him greatly. 19 So then, summon to me all of the prophets of Baal and all of his servants and his priests; no man should fail to come, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come shall not live!” Now Jehu was acting with cunning in order to destroy the servants of Baal. 20 Then Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!” So they proclaimed it. 21 Jehu sent word through all of Israel, and all of the servants of Baal came; there did not remain a man who did not come. They came to the house of Baal so that the house of Baal was filled from wall to wall. 22 He said to the one who was over the wardrobe, “Bring out clothing for all of the servants of Baal.” So he brought the clothing out for them. 23 Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Recab came to the temple of Baal, and he said to the servants of Baal, “Search and see that there is none of the servants of Yahweh here with you; only those who serve Baal.” 24 They came to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed for himself eighty men outside, and he said, “The man who lets anyone escape from the men who I am entrusting to you, he will pay with his life!” 25 It happened that when he finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the royal guard and to the officers, “Come and kill them; let no man go free!” So they put them to the sword, and the royal guard and the officers threw them out, then they went up to the citadel of the temple of Baal. 26 They brought out the stone pillars of the temple of Baal and burned them. 27 So they broke down the stone pillars of Baal and destroyed the temple of Baal and made it into a latrine until this day. 28 So Jehu wiped out Baal from Israel. 29 Only Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat by which he caused Israel to sin; namely, the calf-shaped idols of gold that were in Bethel and Dan. 30 Yahweh said to Jehu, “Because you have done well by doing right in my eyes and you have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart; therefore, sons of the fourth generation will sit for you on the throne of Israel.” 31 But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of Yahweh God of Israel with all his heart; he did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam by which he caused Israel to sin. 32 In those days, Yahweh began to reduce Israel, so Hazael defeated them in every territory of Israel, 33 from the Jordan eastward: all of the land of Gilead, the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer which is on the Wadi Arnon and Gilead and Bashan. 34 Now the remainder of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all of his powerful deeds, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel? 35 So Jehu slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria, and Jehoahaz his son became king in his place. 36 Now the days which Jehu had reigned over Israel were twenty-eight years in Samaria.

2 Kings,"1 Now Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, so she prepared to destroy all of the offspring of the royal family. 2 But Jehosheba the daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah took Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, and she stole him from among the sons of the king who were being put to death, putting him and his nurse in the inner bedroom. So they hid him from the presence of Athaliah, and he was not killed. 3 He remained with her in the temple of Yahweh, hidden for six years while Athaliah was reigning over the land. 4 But in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and took the commanders of the hundreds of the Carites and the runners, and he brought them to himself to the temple of Yahweh. Then he made a covenant with them and made them swear in the house of Yahweh and showed them the son of the king. 5 He commanded them, saying, “This is the thing that you must do: one third of you who go off duty on the Sabbath, the keepers of the guard in the house of the king, 6 and another third at the gate of Sur, and a third at the gate behind the runners, shall guard the post of the palace alternately. 7 Two of the units among you, all who go on duty on the Sabbath, guard the post of the temple of Yahweh for the king. 8 You must surround the king all about, each with his weapon in his hand; whoever comes to the ranks must be killed. Be with the king wherever he goes.” 9 So the commanders of hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and each took his men who went off duty on the Sabbath and those who came on duty on the Sabbath, and they came to Jehoiada the priest. 10 Then the priest gave to the commanders of the hundreds spears and small round shields which were King David’s, which were in the temple of Yahweh. 11 So the royal runners stood, each with his weapons in his hand, from the side of the temple to the south up to the side of the temple on the north, around the altar and around the temple, about the king all around. 12 Then he brought out the son of the king, put the crown on him with the testimony, and they made him king, anointed him, clapped their hands, and said, “Long live the king!” 13 When Athaliah heard the sound of the runners of the people, she came to the people at the temple of Yahweh. 14 She looked, and there was the king standing by the pillar according to the custom. The commanders and the trumpeters were by the king, and all of the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing on the trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes and she called, “Treason, treason!” 15 Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the commanders of the hundreds, the appointed of the army, and he said to them, “Bring her out to the house of the ranks! The one coming after her should kill her with the sword,” for the priest had said, “Let her not be killed in the temple of Yahweh.” 16 So they grabbed her as she went by the entranceway of the horses to the palace of the king, and she was killed there. 17 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh and the king and the people, that the people should be as a people for Yahweh, and also a covenant between the king and the people. 18 Then all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down, and its altars and its images they broke completely into pieces. Mattan the priest of Baal they killed in front of the altars. Then the priest put guards over the house of Yahweh. 19 He took the commanders of the hundreds and the Carites and the runners and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the temple of Yahweh. And they marched by the way of the runner’s gate to the palace of the king, and he sat on the throne of the kings. 20 All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city rested; for Athaliah had been killed with the sword in the palace of the king. 21 Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign. 1 In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king. He reigned in Jerusalem forty years, and the name of his mother was Zibiah from Beersheba. 2 Jehoash did right in the eyes of Yahweh all of his days, because Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 3 Only the high places were not removed; the people were still making sacrifices and offering incense on the high places. 4 Jehoash said to the priests, “All of the money for the sacred things that is brought to the temple of Yahweh, the money taxed at its proper value for each person and all of the money that comes upon the heart of a man to bring to the temple of Yahweh, 5 let the priests take for themselves, each from his treasurers, and let them repair the breach of the temple for every place where damage is found.” 6 It happened in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash that the priests had not repaired the damage in the temple. 7 So King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the priests, and he said to them, “Why are you not repairing the damage in the temple? Now, you shall not take money from your treasurers for the damage in the temple. You must provide it.” 8 So the priests agreed not to take money from the people and not to repair the damage to the temple. 9 Then Jehoiada the priest took a certain chest and bored a hole in its lid, and he put it beside the altar to the right as a man enters into the temple of Yahweh; then the priests who were keepers of the threshold would put there all of the money brought into the temple. 10 It happened that when they saw a great deal of money in the chest, the secretary of the king and the high priest would come up, put the money in bags, then count the money found in the temple of Yahweh. 11 They placed the money, which was weighed out, into the hands of the workers who were appointed over the temple of Yahweh, and they paid it to the skilled craftsmen of wood and to the builders working on the temple of Yahweh 12 and to the masons and the stonecutters, to buy timber and stones for hewing, in order to repair the damage of the temple of Yahweh, and for all who went to the temple to repair it. 13 Only, for the temple of Yahweh, there were not any silver basins, snuffers, bowls for drinking wine, trumpets, or any vessel of gold or silver from the money being brought to the temple of Yahweh. 14 For they gave that to all the workers, and they repaired the temple of Yahweh with it. 15 They did not have to settle accounts with the men into whose hands they placed the money to give to the workers, for they were dealing honestly. 16 The money of the guilt offering and the money of the sin offering was not brought into the temple of Yahweh, but were each for the priests. 17 At that time, Hazael king of Aram went up and fought against Gath and captured it; then Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem. 18 Jehoash king of Judah took all of the holy objects that Jehoshaphat, Joram, and Ahaziah his ancestors, the kings of Judah, had devoted, and all his holy objects and all of the gold found in the treasuries of the temple of Yahweh, and in the palace of the king, and he sent them to Hazael king of Aram, so that he went up from Jerusalem. 19 Now the remainder of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 20 Then his servants arose and conspired and killed Joash in the house of the Millo as he was going down toward Silla. 21 Jozabad the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him and killed him, so they buried him with his ancestors in the city of David. Then Amaziah his son became king in his place. ",2 Kings 11-12,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/2-kings-1112-14240/direct-download/tbd20071031.mp3
2 Kings,"1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign. 2 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do right in the eyes of Yahweh his God as David his ancestor. 3 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel; he even let his son pass through the fire according to the detestable things of the nations which Yahweh drove out from before the Israelites. 4 He sacrificed and offered incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree. 5 Then Rezin the king of Aram went up with Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel against Jerusalem for battle, and they besieged Ahaz but were not able to defeat him. 6 At that time, Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram and drove out the Judeans from Elath. The Arameans came to Elath and have lived there until this day. 7 Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the king of Aram and from the hand of the king of Israel who are rising up against me.” 8 Ahaz took the silver and gold found in the house of Yahweh and in the treasury rooms of the palace of the king, and he sent a gift to the king of Assyria. 9 So the king of Assyria listened to him and he went up to Damascus and captured it and deported them to Kir. He also killed Rezin. 10 So King Ahaz went to meet Tiglath-Pileser the king of Assyria in Damascus, and he saw the altar that was in Damascus, so King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest the builder’s plan of the altar and the exact model of how it had been made. 11 So Uriah the priest built the altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus; thus Uriah the priest did before King Ahaz came from Damascus. 12 When the king came from Damascus, the king saw the altar, so he went near to the altar and went up on it. 13 Then he offered his burnt offerings and his grain offerings, he poured his libations and dashed the blood of his fellowship offerings against the altar. 14 Now the bronze altar that was before Yahweh, he brought over from the front of the temple, from between his altar and the temple of Yahweh, and he placed it at the side of his altar to the north. 15 Then King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, “On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the grain offering of the evening, the burnt offering of the king and his grain offering, the burnt offering of all of the people of the land, their offerings, their libations, and all of the blood of the burnt offerings, the blood of the sacrifices you must dash on it. But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.” 16 So Uriah the priest did according to all that King Ahaz commanded. 17 Then King Ahaz cut off the side panels of the water carts and removed from upon them the basin, and the sea he took down from the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a stone base. 18 The covering for the Sabbath, which they had built in the palace and in the entrance of the king to the outside, he removed from the temple of Yahweh because of the presence of the king of Assyria. 19 Now the remainder of the acts of Ahaz that he did, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 20 So Ahaz slept with his ancestors and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David, and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place. 1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz the king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, reigning nine years. 2 He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, only not as the kings of Israel who were before him. 3 Shalmaneser the king of Assyria came up against him, and Hoshea became his vassal and paid tribute to him. 4 But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea, for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and he did not offer tribute to the king of Assyria as he had year after year; so the king of Assyria arrested him, and confined him in a house of imprisonment. 5 So the king of Assyria went up in all the land, then he went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years. 6 In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported Israel to Assyria. He placed them in Halah, in Habor, in the river regions of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. 7 Now this happened because the Israelites had sinned against Yahweh their God when he brought them up from the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh the king of Egypt and they feared other gods. 8 They walked in the statutes of the nations whom Yahweh had driven out from before the Israelites, which the kings of Israel had introduced. 9 The Israelites secretly did things that were not right against Yahweh their God; they built high places for themselves in all their towns, from the watchtower up to the fortified city. 10 They set up for themselves stone pillars and poles of Asherah worship on every high hill and under every green tree. 11 They burned incense there on all the high places, like the nations which Yahweh deported before them, and they did evil things to provoke Yahweh. 12 They served idols of which Yahweh had said to them, “You shall not do this thing!” 13 Yahweh warned Israel and Judah by the hand of his every prophet, with every seer saying, “Turn from all of your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my ordinances, according to all the law which I commanded your ancestors, which I sent to you by the hand of my servants the prophets.” 14 But they did not listen and they stiffened their necks, like the necks of their ancestors who did not believe in Yahweh their God. 15 They rejected his statutes, his covenant which he made with their ancestors, and his warnings which he gave to them; and they went after the idols, became vain, and went after all the nations which were all around them, which Yahweh had commanded them not to do as they did. 16 They abandoned all the commands of Yahweh their God and made for themselves two molten calf-shaped idols; they made a pole of Asherah worship and bowed down to the army of the heavens and served Baal. 17 They made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire, they practiced divination and read omens, and they sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of Yahweh to provoke him. 18 So Yahweh was very angry with Israel and he removed them from his presence; none remained except the tribe of Judah alone. 19 Even Judah did not keep the commands of Yahweh their God, and they walked in the customs of Israel which they introduced, 20 so Yahweh rejected all the offspring of Israel and punished them, and he gave them into the hand of the plunderers until he banished them from his presence. 21 For he had torn Israel from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king, but Jeroboam detached Israel from following Yahweh, and he made them sin a great sin. 22 The Israelites walked in all the sins of Jeroboam that he committed, and they did not depart from it, 23 until Yahweh removed Israel from his presence as he had foretold by the hand of all his servants, the prophets. And so he deported Israel from upon his land to Assyria until this day. 24 The king of Assyria brought from Babylonia, from Cush, from Arva, from Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and he settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the Israelites, so they took possession of Samaria and lived in her cities. 25 It happened that when they began living there, they did not fear Yahweh, so Yahweh sent lions among them, and they were killing them. 26 So they said to the king of Assyria, “The nations whom you deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the customs of the God of the land, so he sent lions among them, and now they are killing them because they do not know the customs of the God of the land.” 27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Release one of the priests whom you deported from there, and let him go and settle there. Let him teach them the customs of the God of the land.” 28 So one of the priests went, whom they had deported from Samaria, and he settled in Bethel and was teaching them how they should fear Yahweh. 29 Yet every nation was making their gods, and they put them in the shrine of the high places that the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they were living. 30 The men of Babylonia made Succoth Benoth; the men of Cush made Nergal; the men of Hamath made Ashima. 31 The Arvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; the Sepharvites were burning their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim. 32 Those who were fearing Yahweh made priests of the high places from among themselves, and they were sacrificing for them in the shrines of the high places. 33 Yahweh they were fearing, but their gods they were serving, according to the customs of the nations from which they were deported. 34 Until this day they are doing according to their former customs; none of them are fearing Yahweh, and none of them are doing according to their statutes, to their decisions, to the law, or to the commands that Yahweh commanded the descendants of Jacob to whom he had given the name Israel. 35 Yahweh had made a covenant with them and commanded them, “You shall not fear other gods, nor shall you bow down to them, nor shall you serve them, nor shall you sacrifice to them. 36 Rather, Yahweh, who brought you out from the land of Egypt with great strength and with an outstretched arm—him you shall fear, and to him you shall bow down, and to him you shall sacrifice. 37 The statutes, the decisions, the law, and the commands that he wrote to you, you shall observe to do always, and you shall not fear other gods. 38 The covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget, and you shall not fear other gods. 39 But Yahweh your God you shall fear, and he will deliver you from the hand of all of your enemies.” 40 They did not listen but kept on doing according to their former customs. 41 So these nations were fearing Yahweh, but they were serving their idols, as were their children and their children’s children; as their ancestors did, they are doing until this day.

2 Kings,"1 It happened in the third year of Hoshea the son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah became king. 2 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah. 3 He did right in the eyes of Yahweh according to all that David his ancestor had done. 4 He removed the high places, and he smashed the stone pillars; he cut down the poles of Asherah worship and demolished the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for up to those days the Israelites were offering incense to it and called it Nehushtan. 5 He trusted in Yahweh the God of Israel; there was no one like him, before or after, among all the kings of Judah. 6 He held on to Yahweh; he did not depart from following him, and he kept his commands that Yahweh had commanded Moses. 7 Yahweh was with him; everywhere he went, he succeeded. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him. 8 He attacked the Philistines up to Gaza and its territory from the watchtower up to the fortified city. 9 It happened in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, that is, the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria came against Samaria and laid siege against her. 10 At the end of three years, he captured it in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is, the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel; Samaria was captured. 11 Then the king of Assyria deported Israel to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Habor, in the river regions of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, 12 because they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh their God, and they transgressed his covenant; all that he had commanded Moses, the servant of Yahweh, they did not listen to nor did they obey. 13 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all of the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 14 So Hezekiah king of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong. Withdraw from me. What you impose on me I will bear.” So the king of Assyria imposed on Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 15 Then Hezekiah gave all of the silver found in the temple of Yahweh and in the storerooms of the house of the king. 16 At that time, Hezekiah cut off the doors of the temple of Yahweh and the doorposts which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and he gave them to the king of Assyria. 17 So the king of Assyria sent the commander in chief, the chief eunuch, and the chief advisor from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem with a heavy army. They went up and came to Jerusalem, then they went up and came and stood at the aqueduct of the upper pool which is on the main road of the washer’s field. 18 Then they called to the king, so Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came out to them. 19 Then the chief advisor said to them, “Please say to Hezekiah: ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: “What is this confidence that you trust? 20 You think only a word of lips, ‘I have advice and power for the war.’ Now, on whom do you trust that you have rebelled against me? 21 Now, look! You rely on the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, which when a man leans on it, it goes into his hand and pierces it! So is Pharaoh the king of Egypt for all who are trusting on him! 22 But if you say to me, ‘On Yahweh our God we trust,’ is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, and he had said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘In the presence of this altar you shall bow down only in Jerusalem?’ 23 So then, please make a wager with my lord, with the king of Assyria, and I will give to you a thousand horses if you are able on your part to put riders on them. 24 How can you repulse a single captain among the least of the servants of my master? Yet you rely for yourself on Egypt for chariots and horsemen! 25 Have I now come up against this place without Yahweh to destroy it? Yahweh has said to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it!’ ” ’ ” 26 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah and Shebna and Joah said to the chief commander, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we are understanding, but you must not speak Judean with us in the ears of the people who are on the wall.” 27 The chief commander said to them, “Is it solely to your master and to you my master has sent me to speak these words? Is it not for the men who sit on the wall to eat their feces and to drink their urine with you?” 28 Then the chief commander stood and called with a great voice in Judean, and he spoke and said, “Hear the word of the king, the great king of Assyria! 29 Thus says the king, ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to rescue you from my hand. 30 Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Certainly Yahweh will rescue us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!” ’ 31 Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make with me a treaty of peace and come out to me that each may eat from his vine and each from his fig tree, and each may drink water from his cistern! 32 Until I come and take you to a land like your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees, olive oil, and honey, that you may live and not die! You must not listen to Hezekiah, for he has misled you by saying, “Yahweh will deliver us!” 33 Did the gods of each of the nations ever rescue the land from the hand of the king of Assyria? 34 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? For did they rescue Samaria from my hand? 35 Who among all of the gods of the countries have rescued their countries from my hand that Yahweh should rescue Jerusalem from my hand?’ ” 36 The people were silent, and they did not answer him a word, for the command of that king was saying, “You shall not answer him.” 37 Eliakim the son of Hilkiah who was over the palace, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with torn clothes, and they told him the words of the chief commander.

2 Kings,"1 It happened that when King Hezekiah heard, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went to the temple of Yahweh. 2 He sent Eliakim who was over the palace, Shebna the secretary, the elders, and the priests, all clothed in sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 3 They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘A day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace is this day, for the children are about to be born, but there is no strength to bear them. 4 Perhaps Yahweh your God will hear all of the words of the chief commander whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to insult the living God, and he will rebuke the words that Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remainder who are left.’ ” 5 So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, 6 and Isaiah said to them, “Thus you must say to your master, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “You must not be afraid because the face of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled me. 7 Look, I am putting in him a spirit. He will hear a rumor and return to his land. Then I will cause him to fall by the sword in his land.” ’ ” 8 When the chief commander returned, he found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish. 9 He heard about Tirhakah, the king of Cush, saying, “Look, he has set out to fight with you,” so he again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 10 “Thus you shall say to Hezekiah the king of Judah, ‘Let not your God whom you are trusting deceive you, by his saying, “Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!” 11 Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, by utterly destroying them, and shall you be delivered? 12 Did the gods of the nations that my predecessors destroyed deliver them? Not Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, nor the children of Eden who were in Tel Assar. 13 Where are the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’ ” 14 Hezekiah took the letters from the hand of the messengers and read them. Then he went up to the temple of Yahweh, and Hezekiah spread them out before the presence of Yahweh. 15 Then Hezekiah prayed before the face of Yahweh and said, “O Yahweh, God of Israel who lives above the cherubim. You are God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the world; you have made the heavens and the earth. 16 Incline your ears and hear; open, O Yahweh, your eyes and see and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to insult the living God. 17 Truly, O Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have utterly destroyed the nations and their land. 18 He has hurled their gods in the fire because they are not gods, but the work of the hands of a human made of wood and stone, so they destroyed them. 19 So then, O Yahweh our God, rescue us, please, from his hand, that all of the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Yahweh, you alone are God!” 20 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘What you have prayed to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard. 21 This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: She despises you, she scorns you, the virgin daughter of Zion. Behind you the daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head. 22 Whom have you mocked and reviled? And against whom have you have raised your voice and have haughtily lifted your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel! 23 By the hand of your messengers you have mocked the Lord, and you have said, ‘With my many chariots I have gone up to the height of the mountains. To the remote areas of Lebanon, I have felled the tallest of its cedars, the choicest of its cypresses. I have entered the place of overnight lodging. Even to the edge of forest of its fertile land. 24 I dug wells and I drank foreign water, and I dried up with the sole of my steps all the canals of Egypt.’ 25 Have you not heard? From long ago I have determined it, from the days of old I have planned it, and now I am bringing it to pass. It shall be turned into a pile of rocks; fortified cities are ruined. 26 Their inhabitants, short of hand, shall be dismayed; and they shall be ashamed. They have become green plants of the open field, and tender grass, green grass of the roof and blight before the standing grain. 27 Your sitting, your going out, and your coming in I know, and your raging against me. 28 Because you are raging against me, and your arrogance has come up in my ears, I will put my nose ring in your nose and my bridle in your mouth. And I will turn you back on the way that you have come. 29 “ ‘This will be the sign for you: Eat the volunteer plants for the year, and in the second year, the volunteer plants that spring up from that. But in the third year, sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 30 The remainder of the house of Judah that survives will again take root below and bear fruit above. 31 For from Jerusalem a remnant shall go out and survivors from Mount Zion; the zeal of Yahweh will do this. 32 “ ‘Therefore thus says Yahweh to the king of Assyria, “He shall not come to this city, nor shall he shoot an arrow there, nor shall he bring a small shield near her, nor shall he cast a siege ramp against her. 33 By the way that he came to her he shall return; but to this city, he shall not come,” declares Yahweh. 34 And I will defend this city to save her for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.’ ” 35 It happened in that night that an angel of Yahweh went out, and he struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of Assyria. When they got up early in the morning, look! All of them were dead corpses. 36 Then Sennacherib king of Assyria set out and went and returned and lived in Nineveh. 37 It happened that he was worshiping in the temple of Nisroch his god, and Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword. Then they escaped into the land of Ararat, and Esarhaddon his son became king in his place. 1 In those days Hezekiah became deathly ill, and Isaiah the son of Amoz the prophet came to him and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Command your house, for you are about to die; you will not recover.’ ” 2 Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh, saying, 3 “O Yahweh, please remember how I went about before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and remember the good that I have done in your eyes.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly.

2 Kings,"1 In those days Hezekiah became deathly ill, and Isaiah the son of Amoz the prophet came to him and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Command your house, for you are about to die; you will not recover.’ ” 2 Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh, saying, 3 “O Yahweh, please remember how I went about before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and remember the good that I have done in your eyes.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly. 4 Isaiah had not gone out from the middle of the city when the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 5 “Return; you must say to Hezekiah, the leader of my people, ‘Thus says Yahweh the God of David your ancestor, “I have heard your prayer and I have seen your tears. Look, I am about to heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the temple of Yahweh. 6 I will add to your days fifteen years, and from the hand of the king of Assyria I will deliver you and this city. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.” ’ ” 7 Then Isaiah said, “Bring a lump of figs,” so they took and put it on the skin sores, and he lived. 8 Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What is the sign that Yahweh will heal me that I shall go up on the third day to the temple of Yahweh?” 9 Isaiah said, “This is the sign for you from Yahweh that Yahweh will do the thing that he has promised: Shall the shadow advance ten steps or shall it return ten steps?” 10 Hezekiah answered, “It is easy for the shadow to lengthen ten steps. No, but let the shadow return backwards ten steps.” 11 Isaiah the prophet called to Yahweh, and he brought back the shadow on the steps where it had gone down on the steps of Ahaz, backwards ten steps. 12 At that time, Berodak-Baladan the son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been ill. 13 Hezekiah heard about them and showed them all of the house of his treasure, both the silver and the gold, the spices, the good olive oil, the room of his weapons, and all that could be found in his treasuries. There was nothing that he did not show them in his palace and in all of his kingdom. 14 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?” Hezekiah said, “From a far land; they have come from Babylon.” 15 Then he asked, “What did they see in your palace?” And Hezekiah said, “All that is in my palace they have seen; there is nothing that I did not show them in my treasuries.” 16 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of Yahweh! 17 ‘Look, days are coming when all that is in your palace will be carried off; even all that your ancestors have stored up until this day, to Babylon; nothing shall be left,’ says Yahweh. 18 ‘Your sons who went out from you, whom you brought forth, will be taken, and they shall be eunuchs in the temple of the king of Babylon.’ ” 19 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of Yahweh that you have spoken is good,” and he thought, “Is it not that peace and security shall be in my days?” 20 Now the remainder of the acts of Hezekiah, all of his powerful deeds, and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought the water into the city, are they not written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 21 Then Hezekiah slept with his ancestors, and Manasseh his son became king in his place.

2 Kings,"1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hephzibah. 2 He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, according to the detestable things of the nations that Yahweh had driven out from the presence of the Israelites. 3 He returned and rebuilt the high places that Hezekiah his father had destroyed. He erected altars for Baal and made a pole of Asherah worship just as Ahab king of Israel had made, and he bowed down to all of the host of heaven and served them. 4 He built altars in the temple of Yahweh about which Yahweh had said, “I will put my name in Jerusalem.” 5 He built an altar to all of the host of heaven in the two courtyards of the temple of Yahweh. 6 He made his son pass through the fire, practiced soothsaying and divination, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He increased the doing of evil in the eyes of Yahweh to provoke him. 7 He put the image of the Asherah that he had made in the temple of which Yahweh had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this temple and in Jerusalem which I have chosen from all of the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever. 8 I will not again make the feet of Israel wander from the land which I have given to their ancestors, if they only observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, as far as the law that Moses my servant commanded them.” 9 But Manasseh did not listen and tempted them to do evil more than the nations that Yahweh destroyed before the presence of the Israelites. 10 So Yahweh spoke by the hand of his servants the prophets, saying, 11 “Because Manasseh the king of Judah committed these detestable things and did evil more than the Amorites did who were before him and caused even Judah to sin with his idols, 12 therefore, thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘Look, I am bringing disaster upon Jerusalem and Judah about which the two ears of all who hear it will tingle. 13 I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plumb line of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes the dish; he wipes it and turns it on its face. 14 I will give up the remainder of my inheritance, and I will give them into the hand of their enemies. They shall become as prey and as spoil for all their enemies, 15 because they have done evil in my eyes and were provoking me from the day that their ancestors came out from Egypt up to this day.’ ” 16 Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood until he filled Jerusalem from one end to another, apart from his sin which he caused Judah to sin by doing evil in the eyes of Yahweh. 17 The remainder of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did and his sin that he committed, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 18 Then Manasseh slept with his ancestors and was buried in the garden of his palace, in the garden of Uzza. Amon his son became king in his place. 19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz from Jotbah. 20 He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh as Manasseh his father had done. 21 He walked in all of the way that his father had walked, and he served the idols that his father had served and bowed down to them. 22 He abandoned Yahweh the God of his ancestors and did not walk in the way of Yahweh. 23 The servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his palace. 24 But the people of the land killed all who conspired against the king and made Josiah his son king in his place. 25 The remainder of the acts of Amon that he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 26 They buried him in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son became king in place of him. 1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah from Bozkath. 2 He did right in the eyes of Yahweh, and he walked in all of the way of David his ancestor and did not turn aside to the right or to the left. 3 It happened in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent word to Shaphan the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the secretary of the temple of Yahweh, saying, 4 “Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, and let them count the money being brought to the temple of Yahweh that the keepers of the threshold have collected from the people, 5 and let them give it into the hand of those appointed doers of the work at the temple of Yahweh. Let them give it to the doers of the work who are at the temple of Yahweh to repair the breach of the temple: 6 to the skilled craftsmen, to the builders, to the masons, and to buy timber and hewing stones to repair the temple. 7 Only the money being given to them is not to be accounted for by them, for they are dealing with honesty.” 8 Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the scroll of the Torah in the temple of Yahweh,” and Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan and he read it. 9 Shaphan the secretary came to the king and returned the king a word, and he said, “Your servant poured out the money found in the temple, and they have given it into the hand of the doers of the work appointed over the temple of Yahweh.” 10 Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king saying, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll.” Then Shaphan read before the king. 11 When the king heard the words of the scroll of the Torah, he tore his clothes.

2 Kings,"2 He did right in the eyes of Yahweh, and he walked in all of the way of David his ancestor and did not turn aside to the right or to the left. 3 It happened in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent word to Shaphan the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the secretary of the temple of Yahweh, saying, 4 “Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, and let them count the money being brought to the temple of Yahweh that the keepers of the threshold have collected from the people, 5 and let them give it into the hand of those appointed doers of the work at the temple of Yahweh.

For the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against us is great because our ancestors did not listen to the words of this scroll to do according to all that is written concerning us!” 14 So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah the son of Harhas, the keeper of the robes. Now she was living in Jerusalem in the second district. Then they spoke to her, 15 and she said to them, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘Say to the man who sent you to me, 16 “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Look I am bringing evil to this place and upon its inhabitants, according to all of the words of that scroll that the king of Judah has read 17 because they have abandoned me and they have burned incense to other gods, provoking me to anger with all of the works of their hands. My wrath shall be kindled against this place and not be quenched.’ ” 18 And to the king of Judah who sent all of you to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall say to him, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘Concerning the words that you have heard, 19 because you have a responsive heart, and you humbled yourself before Yahweh when you heard how I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants to become a desolation and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before my face, I have also heard, declares Yahweh. 20 Therefore look, I am gathering you to your ancestors, and you shall be gathered to your tombs in peace. Your eyes will not see all of the disaster that I am bringing onto this place.’ ” ’ ” Then they reported the word to the king. 1 So the king sent word, and all of the elders of Judah and Jerusalem gathered to him. 2 Then the king went up to the temple of Yahweh, and all of the men of Judah and all of the inhabitants of Jerusalem were with him, including the priests, the prophets, and all of the people from smallest to greatest; and in their hearing he read all of the words of the scroll of the covenant that had been found in the temple of Yahweh. 3 Then the king stood by the pillar, and he made a covenant before Yahweh, to go after Yahweh and to keep his commands and his warnings and his statutes with all of his heart and with all of his soul, to keep the words of this covenant written on this scroll. Then all of the people joined in the covenant. 4 Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the second priests, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of the temple of Yahweh all of the objects made for Baal and for the Asherah and for all the host of heaven, and he burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and then he carried their ashes to Bethel. 5 He removed the priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense on the high places at the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem and who offered incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven. 6 He brought out the Asherah image from the temple of Yahweh outside of Jerusalem to the Wadi Kidron and burnt it at the Wadi Kidron; then he pulverized it to dust and threw its dust upon the tombs of the common people. 7 He tore down the shrines of the male shrine prostitutes that were in the temple of Yahweh, where the women were weaving shrines for the Asherah. 8 Then he brought all of the priests from the cities of Judah and defiled the high places where the priests from Geba up to Beersheba burned incense. He tore down the high places of the gates which were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which were on the left of each gate of the city. 9 However, the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread in the midst of their relatives. 10 He defiled the Topheth which is in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, to prevent anyone causing his sons or his daughters to pass through the fire for Molech. 11 He kept the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun from coming to the temple of Yawheh at the side room of Nathan-Melech the eunuch, which was in the court; and the chariots of the sun he burned with fire. 12 The altars that were on the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the temple of Yahweh, the king tore down and ran from there and threw their ashes into the Wadi Kidron. 13 The high places that were east of Jerusalem, which were on the south of the Mountain of Destruction which Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab and for Molech the detestable thing of the Ammonites, the king defiled. 14 He also broke into pieces the stone pillars and cut down the Asherah poles and covered their sites with human bones. 15 Moreover, the altar that was in Bethel, the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin, had built, even that altar and the high place, Josiah tore down. Then he burned down the high place and crushed the pole of Asherah worship to dust and burned it with fire. 16 When Josiah turned and saw the tombs which were there on the hill, he sent and took the bones from the tombs and burned them on the altar. Thus he defiled them according to the word of Yahweh that the man of God had proclaimed who had proclaimed these things. 17 Then he said, “What is this gravestone that I am seeing?” The men of the city said to him, “This is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.” 18 So Josiah said, “Let him rest and let no man move his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria. 19 Moreover, all of the shrines of the high places which were in the towns of Samaria which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Yahweh, Josiah removed, and he did to them like all of the deeds he had done in Bethel. 20 Then he slaughtered all of the priests of the high places who were there, on the altars, and he burned the bones of the humans on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem. 21 Then the king commanded all of the people, saying, “Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, as has been written on the scroll of this covenant.” 22 For they had not kept this Passover from the days of the judges who had judged over Israel or during the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah. 23 But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was kept for Yahweh in Jerusalem. 24 Moreover, the mediums and the spiritists, the household gods and the idols, and all of the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, Josiah removed in order to establish the words of the law written on the scroll that Hilkiah the priest had found in the temple of Yahweh. 25 There was not a king like him before him, who turned to Yahweh with all of his heart and with all of his soul and with all of his might according to all of the law of Moses, nor did one arise like him afterwards. 26 However, Yahweh did not turn from the fierceness of his great anger which was kindled against Judah because of all of the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him. 27 Yahweh had said, “Even Judah I will remove from my face, as I have removed Israel; I will reject this city that I have chosen, even Jerusalem and the house of which I said, ‘My name shall be there’!” ",2 Kings 22:2-23:27,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/2-kings-2222327-14247/direct-download/tbd20071109.mp3
2 Kings,"28 The remainder of the acts of Josiah and all that he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 29 In his days, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went up against the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River. King Josiah went to meet him, and he killed him at Megiddo as soon as he saw him. 30 So his servants drove him dead in a chariot from Megiddo, and they brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father. 31 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 32 He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh according to all his ancestors had done. 33 Then Pharaoh Neco confined him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, from reigning in Jerusalem, and imposed a levy on the land of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 34 Then Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in place of Josiah his father, and he changed his name to Jehoiakim. Then he took Jehoahaz and brought him to Egypt, and he died there. 35 The silver and the gold Jehoiakim gave to Pharaoh; however, he taxed the land to give the silver to meet the demands of Pharaoh. Each according to assessment, he exacted payment of the silver and the gold from the people of the land to give to Pharaoh Neco. 36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah from Rumah. 37 He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh according to all that his ancestors had done. 1 In his days, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up because Jehoiakim had become his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him. 2 So Yahweh sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans, raiding bands of Aram, raiding bands of Moab, and raiding bands of the Ammonites. He had sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Yahweh that he had spoken by the hand of his servants the prophets. 3 Surely, it was on the command of Yahweh against Judah to remove them from his sight because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done. 4 Also, for the blood of the innocent that he had shed—and he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood—Yahweh was not willing to forgive. 5 The remainder of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? 6 So Jehoiakim slept with his ancestors, and Jehoiachin his son became king in his place. 7 The king of Egypt did not again come out from his land, for the king of Babylon had taken, from the Wadi of Egypt to the Euphrates River, all that belonged to the king of Egypt. 8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan from Jerusalem. 9 He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh according to all that his father had done. 10 At that time, the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and the city came under the siege. 11 Then Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city while his servants were besieging it. 12 Jehoiachin king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, his mother, his servants, his commanders, and his court officials. The king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. 13 Then he took from there all of the treasures of the temple of Yahweh and the treasures of the palace of the king. He cut up all of the vessels of gold which Solomon the king of Israel had made in the temple of Yahweh, as Yahweh had foretold. 14 He deported all of Jerusalem: all of the commanders, and all of the skilled warriors, ten thousand captives, and all of the skilled craftsmen and the artisans; no one was left over except the poorest of the people of the land. 15 He deported Jehoiachin to Babylon; the mother of the king, the wives of the king, his court officials, and the citizenry of the land he caused to go into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: 16 of all of the skilled men, seven thousand, and of the skilled craftsmen and the artisans, one thousand. All of the mighty warriors fit for war the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. 17 Then the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his uncle king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah. 18 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 19 He did evil in the eyes of Yahweh just like all that Jehoiakim had done. 20 For it happened because of the anger of Yahweh, in Jerusalem and in Judah, until they were cast out from his presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 1 It happened that in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem. He encamped against it and built siege works against it all around. 2 So the city came under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. 3 In the ninth month, the famine became severe in the city, and there was no food for the people of the land. 4 Then the city was breached, and all of the men of war entered by night by way of the gate between the wall which was by the garden of the king, and the Chaldeans were against the city all around, so he left by the way of the Arabah. 5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the Arabah of Jericho, and all of his army scattered from him. 6 So they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they passed sentence on him. 7 They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; then they blinded the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in bronze fetters and brought him to Babylon. 8 In the fifth month, on the seventh of the month, that is, the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, a commander of the imperial guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. 9 He burned the temple of Yahweh, the palace of the king, and all of the houses of Jerusalem; every large house he burned with fire. 10 And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the commander of the imperial guard tore down the walls of Jerusalem all around. 11 The remainder of the people left in the city, the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the remainder of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the commander of the imperial guard deported. 12 But the poor of the land the commander of the imperial guard left for the vineyards and for tilling. 13 The bronze pillars that were in the temple of Yahweh, and the water carts, and the bronze sea that was in the temple of Yahweh, the Chaldeans broke into pieces and carried their bronze to Babylon. 14 The pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the dishes, and the vessels of bronze with which they served there, they took. 15 The firepans and the basins, whatever was gold, the commander of the imperial guard took for the gold and whatever was silver, for the silver. 16 The two pillars, the one sea, and the water cart that Solomon had made for the temple of Yahweh, there was no weighing to the bronze of all of these vessels. 17 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; a bronze capital was on it, with the height of the capital being three cubits. The latticework and pomegranates on the capital all around were bronze, and likewise on the latticework for the second pillar. 18 Then the commander of the imperial guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and three of the threshold keepers. 19 From the city he took one court official who was chief officer over the men of war, five men from the king’s council who were found in the city, the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men from the people of the land being found in the city. 20 Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 21 Then the king of Babylon struck them down and killed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath; thus Judah was removed from its land. 22 Now as far as the people left in Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon left behind, he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan over them. 23 When all of the commanders of the troops heard, they and the men, that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seriah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. 24 Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and he said to them, “You must not be afraid because of the Chaldeans. Settle in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and may it go well with you.” 25 But it happened in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama from the offspring of the kingship came, and ten men with him, and they struck down Gedaliah so that he died with the Judeans and with the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. 26 Then all the people, from youngest to oldest, and the commanders of the troops, went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the presence of the Chaldeans. 27 It happened in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month on the twenty-seventh of the month, lifted Evil-Merodach king of Babylon in the year that he became king, the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah from the house of imprisonment. 28 He spoke kindly to him, and he gave him a better seat than the seat of the kings who were with him in Babylon. 29 So he changed the clothes of his imprisonment, and he ate food continually in his presence all the days of his life. 30 His allowance was continually given to him from the king, a portion every day all the days of his life.

1 Samuel,"1 There was a certain man from Ramathaim Zophim, from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 2 He had two wives; the name of the first was Hannah, and the name of the second was Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 3 Now this man used to go up from his town year by year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of hosts in Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to Yahweh. 4 On the day Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. 5 But to Hannah he would give a double portion, because he loved Hannah, though Yahweh had closed her womb. 6 (Now her rival wife would provoke her severely in order to upset her because Yahweh had closed her womb.) 7 And so he used to do year after year; whenever she went up to the house of Yahweh, she would provoke her so that she would weep and would not eat. 8 So Elkanah her husband would say to her: “Hannah, why do you weep and why do you not eat? And why are you heartsick? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” 9 Then Hannah got up after eating and drinking at Shiloh. (Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the temple of Yahweh.) 10 She was deeply troubled, so she prayed to Yahweh and wept bitterly. 11 She made a vow and said: “O Yahweh of hosts, if you will look with compassion on the misery of your female servant, and will remember me, and not forget your female servant, and will give to your female servant a male child then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and a razor will never pass over his head.” 12 While she continued to pray before Yahweh, Eli was observing her mouth. 13 Now Hannah had been speaking in her heart; her lips were moving, but her voice could not be heard, so Eli considered her to be drunk. 14 Then Eli said to her, “How long will you behave like someone who is drunk? Put away your wine!” 15 But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord. I am a woman deeply distressed, but I have not drunk wine or strong drink. Rather, I have poured out my soul before Yahweh. 16 Do not regard your female servant as worthless, but because of the extent of my worries and my provocation I have spoken all of this.” 17 Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have asked of him.” 18 And she said, “May your female slave find favor in your sight.” Then the woman went on her way and ate something, and her face did not look sad any longer. 19 Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before Yahweh and returned to their house at Ramah. Then Elkanah had sexual relations with Hannah his wife, and Yahweh remembered her. 20 In due time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She called his name Samuel, for she said, “I requested him from Yahweh.” 21 So the man Elkanah went up with all his household to make the annual sacrifice to Yahweh and to pay his vow. 22 But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “Once the boy is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear before Yahweh; and he will remain there forever.” 23 So her husband Elkanah said to her, “Do what seems right to you; stay until you wean him. Only may Yahweh fulfill his word.” So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him. 24 Then she brought him up with her when she had weaned him, along with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She brought him to the house of Yahweh at Shiloh while the boy was still young. 25 They slaughtered the bull, and they brought the boy to Eli. 26 She said, “Excuse me, my lord. As you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood with you in this place to pray to Yahweh. 27 I prayed for this boy, and Yahweh has given me my request that I asked from him. 28 I in turn have lent him to Yahweh. As long as he lives he is lent to Yahweh.” Then they worshiped Yahweh there.

1 Samuel,"1 Then Hannah prayed and said, “My heart exults in Yahweh, my strength is exalted in Yahweh; I grin over my enemies, for I rejoice over your salvation. 2 There is no one holy like Yahweh, for there is no one besides you, and there is no rock like our God. 3 Do not increase speaking very proud words! Let no arrogance go forth from your mouth, for Yahweh is a God of knowledge whose deeds are not weighed. 4 The bows of mighty warriors are shattered, but those who stumble gird themselves with strength. 5 Those who were full must hire themselves out for bread, but those who are hungry will become fat. As for the infertile, she will bear seven, but she who has many sons withers away. 6 Yahweh kills and restores alive, he brings down to Sheol and raises up. 7 Yahweh makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and also exalts. 8 He raises up the poor from the dust. From the ash heap he lifts up the needy, to cause them to sit with noble people and to cause them to inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth belong to Yahweh and he has set the inhabited world on them. 9 He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked will be destroyed in the darkness, because a man will not prevail by his might. 10 Yahweh will shatter his adversaries; he will thunder against them in the heavens. Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to his king and will exalt the might of his anointed one. 11 Then Elkanah went to Ramah, to his house. Now the boy was serving Yahweh in the presence of Eli the priest. 12 Now the sons of Eli were worthless scoundrels; they did not know Yahweh. 13 And the custom of the priests with the people was this: When any man brought a sacrifice, as the meat was boiling, the servant of the priest would take a three-pronged meat fork in his hand 14 and would thrust it into the pan or into the kettle or into the cauldron or into the cooking pot. All that the meat fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they used to do to all of the Israelites who came there at Shiloh. 15 Also, before they offered up the fat as a burnt offering, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest meat for roasting, for he will not take boiled meat from you, but only raw.” 16 And if the man said to him, “Let them burn the fat completely first, then take for yourself as you desire,” then he would say to him, “No! Give it now! If not, I will take it by force!” 17 So the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of Yahweh, because the men treated the offering of Yahweh with contempt. 18 Now Samuel was serving before Yahweh, as a boy wearing a linen ephod. 19 His mother used to make for him a small robe and take it to him year by year whenever she came up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. 20 And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and he said, “May Yahweh give you an offspring from this woman in place of the petitioned one that she requested from Yahweh.” Then they went to their home. 21 Yahweh took note of Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters, while the young man Samuel grew up with Yahweh. 22 Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel and that they were having sexual relations with the women who were serving at the entrance of the tent of assembly. 23 And he asked them, “Why are you doing all these things that I am hearing, namely, your evil dealings with all these people? 24 No, my sons, the report is not good that I am hearing the people of Yahweh spreading. 25 If a man sins against a man, then God can intercede for him. But if a man sins against Yahweh, who can intercede for him?” But they did not obey their father, because Yahweh wanted to kill them. 26 But the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with Yahweh and with the people. 27 Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him: “Thus says Yahweh: ‘Did I not clearly reveal myself to the house of your ancestor when they were in Egypt under the house of Pharaoh? 28 And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be a priest to me, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to bear an ephod before me. I gave to the house of your ancestor all the offerings made by fire by the Israelites. 29 Why do you despise my sacrifice and my offering which I commanded for my dwelling place, while you honored your sons more than me by making yourselves fat from the best of all the offerings of my people Israel? 30 Therefore,’ declares Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘though I solemnly said that your house and the house of your ancestor would walk before me forever, but now,’ declares Yahweh, ‘far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me, I will treat with contempt! 31 Look, days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of the house of your ancestor so that no one in your house will live to old age. 32 You will look at the distress of my dwelling place, despite all the good caused for Israel, but there will never be an old man in your household forever! 33 The only one I will not cut off from my altar is you. Rather, to cause your eyes to fail and to cause your soul to grieve, all the members of your household will die as men. 34 This is the sign for you that will come regarding your two sons Hophni and Phinehas: they will both die on the same day! 35 But I will raise up for myself a reliable priest; he will do just according to what is in my heart and in my soul. I will build for him a lasting house and he will walk continually before my anointed one forever. 36 All the remainder of your household will come to bow down before him for a bit of silver or a loaf of bread and will say, “Please assign me to one of the priestly offices so that I can eat a morsel of bread.” ’ ” 1 Now the boy Samuel was serving Yahweh in the presence of Eli. The word of Yahweh was rare in those days; visions were not widespread.

1 Samuel,"1 Now the boy Samuel was serving Yahweh in the presence of Eli. The word of Yahweh was rare in those days; visions were not widespread. 2 And then one day when Eli was lying in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow weak so that he was not able to see) 3 and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, Samuel was lying in the temple of Yahweh where the ark of God was. 4 Then Yahweh called out to Samuel and he said, “Here I am!” 5 And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.” But he said, “I did not call you. Go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down. 6 And Yahweh called Samuel again, so Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.” And he said, “I did not call you, my son. Go back and lie down.” 7 Now Samuel did not yet know Yahweh, and the word of Yahweh had not yet been revealed to him. 8 Again Yahweh called Samuel a third time, so he got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.” Then Eli realized that Yahweh was calling the boy. 9 So Eli said to Samuel “Go lie down. If he calls to you, then you must say, ‘Speak Yahweh, because your servant is listening.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 10 Then Yahweh came and stood there and called out as before, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, because your servant is listening.” 11 So Yahweh said to Samuel, “Look, I am doing something in Israel which will cause the two ears of everyone who hears it to tingle. 12 On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken against his household, from beginning to end. 13 I will make him know that I am about to judge his household forever because of the iniquity that he knew, for his sons were bringing curses on themselves, but he did not rebuke them. 14 Therefore I swore to the house of Eli that the iniquity of the house of Eli would not be atoned for by sacrifice or by offering forever.” 15 So Samuel lay down until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of Yahweh, but Samuel was afraid of telling the vision to Eli. 16 Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!” And he said, “Here I am.” 17 And he said, “What is the message that he spoke to you? Please do not conceal it from me. May God punish you severely if you conceal anything from me of all the words that he told you.” 18 So Samuel told him all the words and did not conceal anything from him. And he said, “He is Yahweh, he will do what is good in his sight.” 19 And Samuel grew up, and Yahweh was with him. He did not allow any of his prophecies to go unfulfilled. 20 All Israel from Dan to Beersheba realized that Samuel was faithful as a prophet to Yahweh. 21 And Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh, for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of Yahweh. 1 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet the Philistines for battle, and they encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek. 2 The Philistines lined up for the battle to meet Israel, and the battle was prolonged until Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield. 3 When the army came back to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to us from Shiloh so that it may come into our midst and deliver us from the hand of our enemies.” 4 So the army sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of hosts who sits between the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. 5 Now when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh arrived at the camp, all Israel let out a loud shout so that the earth shook. 6 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, “What is the noise of this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?” Then they learned that the ark of Yahweh had come into the camp. 7 So the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come to the camp.” And they said, “Woe to us, for this has never happened before! 8 Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the same gods who struck the Egyptians with all sorts of plagues in the desert. 9 Take courage and be men, you Philistines, lest you end up serving the Hebrews just like they have served you. Be men and fight!” 10 So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated and each man fled to his tent, for the slaughter was very great. Thirty thousand foot soldiers from Israel fell. 11 Furthermore, the ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died. 12 A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh that same day, and his clothes were torn and earth was on his head. 13 When he came, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road watching, because his heart was anxious about the ark of God. Now the man had come to give his report in the city, and all the city cried out. 14 When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, “What is the noise of this commotion?” Then the man came quickly and told Eli. 15 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes stayed fixed ahead and he was not able to see. 16 And the man said to Eli, “I am the one who has come from the battle line! I have fled today from the battle line!” And he said, “What exactly happened, my son?” 17 Then the messenger answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines. There has been a great defeat among the troops. Also, your two sons have died, Hophni and Phinehas, and the ark of God has been captured.” 18 Just as he mentioned the ark of God, he fell from his chair backwards against the side of the gate. He broke his neck and died, because the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years. 19 Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and about to give birth. When she heard the news concerning the capture of the ark of God and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she went into labor and gave birth, because her labor pains came upon her. 20 Just before the time of her death, those attending her said, “Do not fear, for you have given birth to a son.” But she did not answer, or pay any attention. 21 She called the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel,” referring to the capture of the ark of God and concerning her father-in-law and husband. 22 And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God was captured.” 1 Now the Philistines had captured the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 2 Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the temple of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon. 3 When the Ashdodites got up early the next morning, there was Dagon fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh! So they took Dagon and returned him to his place. 4 When they got up early in the morning the next day, there was Dagon fallen again with his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh! The head of Dagon and the palms of his two hands were cut off, lying at the threshold; only the body of Dagon was left. 5 (Therefore the priests of Dagon and all who come into the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod until this very day.) 6 Now the hand of Yahweh was heavy against the Ashdodites and he destroyed them and struck them with tumors, both in Ashdod and its territories. 7 The men of Ashdod saw that it was so, and they said, “The ark of the God of Israel should not remain with us, because his hand is harsh on us and on Dagon our god!” 8 So they sent and gathered all the rulers of the Philistines to them, and they asked, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” And they said, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around toward Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel to Gath. 9 After they moved it, the hand of Yahweh was against the city, causing a very great confusion, and he struck the men of the city from the youngest to the oldest, causing tumors to break out on them. 10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people!” 11 So they sent and gathered all the rulers of the Philistines, and they said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it return to its place, so that it will not kill us and our people.” For a deadly confusion was throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. 12 The men who did not die were struck with the tumors, so that the cry of the city for help went up to heaven.

1 Samuel,"1 Now the ark of Yahweh had been in the territory of the Philistines for seven months, 2 and the Philistines called to the priests and to those who practiced divination, saying, “What should we do with the ark of Yahweh? Inform us how we should send it to its place.” 3 They said, “If you are sending the ark of the God of Israel away, you must not send it away empty, but by all means return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will become known to you why his hand is not turned aside from you.” 4 And they said, “What is the guilt offering that we should return to him?” They said, “The number of the rulers of the Philistines is five. Therefore send five gold tumors and five gold mice, because one plague was on all of you and all your rulers. 5 You must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that are ravaging the land, and you must give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand on you and on your gods and on your land. 6 Why should you harden your hearts like the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? Is it not just like when he dealt with them wantonly so that they sent them away and they left? 7 So then, prepare one new utility cart and two milking cows that have never had a yoke on them, and you must harness the cows to the utility cart and then turn their calves from following them to their stall. 8 And you must take the ark of Yahweh and place it on the utility cart with the gold objects that you are returning to him as a guilt offering. You must place them in the container beside the ark and then send it off so that it goes away. 9 You must watch; if it goes up by the way of its territory to Beth Shemesh, he has caused this great disaster to come on us. But if not, then we will know his hand has not struck us; it was by chance that this happened to us. 10 So the men did so; they took two milking cows and harnessed them to the utility cart, but they shut up their calves in the stall. 11 Then they put the ark of Yahweh on the utility cart with the container holding the gold mice and the images of their tumors. 12 The cows went straight on the way on the road to Beth Shemesh, on the one main road, lowing as they went. They did not turn aside to the right or to the left, and the rulers of the Philistines were walking after them up to the border of Beth Shemesh. 13 Now the people of Beth Shemesh were reaping the wheat harvest in the valley. They lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and they were glad to see it. 14 The utility cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh and stopped there where there was a large stone. They split the wood of the utility cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to Yahweh. 15 Then the Levites took down the ark of Yahweh and the container that was beside it, in which were the gold objects, and they set them on the large stone. Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings, and they made sacrifices to Yahweh on that day. 16 The five rulers of the Philistines saw it and returned to Ekron that same day. 17 Now these are the gold tumors which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to Yahweh: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron. 18 And the gold mice according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines, for their five rulers, from the fortified city to the unwalled village of the open country as far as the great stone, where they set the ark of Yahweh until this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh. 19 He struck seventy men among the men of Beth Shemesh because they looked into the ark of Yahweh. So the people mourned because Yahweh had struck a great blow among the people. 20 Then the men of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? And to whom shall it go up from us?” 21 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of Yahweh. Come down and take it up to yourselves.” 1 The men of Kiriath Jearim came and brought up the ark of Yahweh, and they brought it to the house of Abinadab in Gibeah. They consecrated Eleazer his son to guard the ark of Yahweh. 2 From the day the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, days multiplied and became twenty years while all the house of Israel mourned after Yahweh. 3 And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If with all your heart you are turning to Yahweh, remove the foreign gods and Ashtoreths from your midst. Commit your hearts to Yahweh and serve him alone. Then he will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.” 4 So the Israelites removed the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and they served Yahweh alone. 5 Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to Yahweh for you.” 6 So they gathered to Mizpah and drew water and poured it out before Yahweh. They fasted on that day and said there, “We have sinned against Yahweh!” So Samuel judged the Israelites at Mizpah. 7 Now when the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines. 8 Then the Israelites said to Samuel, “You must not cease from crying out to Yahweh our God, so that he will deliver us from the hand of the Philistines.” 9 So Samuel took a single nursing lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to Yahweh. Then Samuel cried out to Yahweh on behalf of Israel, and Yahweh answered him. 10 While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near for the battle against Israel. But Yahweh thundered against the Philistines with a great noise on that day and threw them into confusion so that they were defeated before Israel. 11 Then the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and they struck them down as far as below Beth Car. 12 So Samuel took a single stone and put it between Mizpah and Shen, and he named it Ebenezer and said, “Up to here Yahweh has helped us.” 13 So the Philistines were subdued and they did not come into the territory of Israel again, and the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. 14 The towns which the Philistines had taken from Israel were returned to Israel from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territories from the hand of the Philistines. Then there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. 15 Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 16 He used to go on the circuit from year to year. He went around Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places. 17 Then he returned to Ramah, because his house was there, and there he judged Israel, and he built an altar to Yahweh there. 1 When Samuel grew old he appointed his sons as judges over Israel. 2 The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba. 3 But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after gain, they took bribes, and they perverted justice. 4 So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. 5 They said to him, “Look, you are old and your sons do not follow in your ways. So then appoint a king for us to judge us, like all the nations. 6 But the matter was displeasing to Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us,” so Samuel prayed to Yahweh. 7 Then Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people concerning all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them. 8 Like all the deeds they have done from the day I brought them up from Egypt until this day, they have forsaken me and have served other gods—so they are doing to you also. 9 And so then, listen to their voice. However, you must earnestly warn them; you must explain to them the custom of the king who will rule over them.” 10 So Samuel spoke all the words of Yahweh to the people who were requesting a king from him. 11 He said, “This will be the custom of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and his horsemen, and they will run before his chariots. 12 He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and those to do his plowing and to reap his harvest, and those to make weapons of war and the equipment for his chariots. 13 He will take your daughters as his perfume makers and as cooks and as bakers. 14 He will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive trees and will give them to his servants. 15 He will take a tenth of your seed and your vineyards and give it to his high officials and to his servants. 16 He will take your male slaves and your female slaves and the best of your young men and your donkeys and will use them for his projects. 17 He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his servants. 18 So you will cry out on that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but Yahweh will not answer you on that day!” 19 However, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel and they said, “No, but there must be a king over us, 20 so that we also may be like all the nations, and our king may rule us and go out before us and fight our battles.” 21 Now when Samuel heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of Yahweh. 22 Then Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice, and appoint a king for them.” So Samuel spoke to the men of Israel, “Each of you go to his own town.” ",1 Samuel 6-8,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-samuel-6-8-9251/direct-download/tbd20070828.mp3
1 Samuel,"1 Now there was a man from Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjaminite, a very wealthy man. 2 He had a son whose name was Saul, a young and handsome man. There was not a man from the Israelites more handsome than he was; from his shoulders up, he was taller than all the people. 3 Now the female donkeys of Kish the father of Saul got lost, and Kish said to Saul his son, “Please take one of the servants with you and get up; go and seek the female donkeys.” 4 So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim; he passed through the land of Shalisha but they did not find them. They passed through the land of Shaalim but they were not there. He passed through the land of Benjamin but did not find them. 5 When they entered the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, lest my father cease caring about the female donkeys and worry about us!” 6 But he said to him, “Look, a man of God is in this town, and the man is honored. All that he says certainly comes true. So then let us go there; perhaps he will tell us about our journey on which we have gone.” 7 So Saul said to his servant, “Look, we may go, but what should we bring to the man? For the bread is gone from our bags, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have with us?” 8 The servant again answered Saul and said, “Look, I have in my hand a quarter shekel of silver! I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us our way.” 9 (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say: “Come, let us go up to the seer.” For the prophet of today was formerly called a seer.) 10 So Saul said to his servant, “Your suggestion is a good one. Come, let us go.” And they went to the town where the man of God was. 11 They were going up the ascent of the town when they found young women going out to draw water. They said to them, “Is there the seer here?” 12 They answered them and said, “There is. Look, he is just in front of you! Hurry now, because he has come to the town today, because there is a sacrifice for the people today at the high place. 13 As soon as you enter the town, you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice. Then afterward the invited guests will eat. So then, go up, because you will find him today!” 14 So they went up to the town. As they were entering into the middle of the town, Samuel was coming forth to meet them, to go up to the high place. 15 Now Yahweh had revealed this to Samuel the day before Saul arrived, saying, 16 “This time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you must anoint him as leader over my people Israel. He will deliver my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have seen the suffering of my people, because their cry of distress has come to me.” 17 When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh answered him, “Here is the man about whom I told you! This is the one who will govern my people.” 18 Then Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate and said, “Please tell me, where is the house of the seer?” 19 Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place, and you will eat with me today; then I will send you away in the morning. I will tell you all that is on your mind. 20 And as for your female donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not be concerned about them, because they have been found. For whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not for you and for all the house of your father?” 21 Saul answered and said, “Am I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the humblest of all the families of the tribes of Benjamin? Why do you speak to me in this way?” 22 So Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them to a room in the building and gave them a place at the head of the invited guests. There were about thirty men. 23 Then Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion that I gave to you, about which I said to you, ‘Keep it with you.’ ” 24 So the cook took up the shank and what was on it and put it before Saul, and he said, “Look, the saved portion is placed before you—eat, because it has been kept for you for the appointed time,” and he said, “I have invited the people.” So Saul ate with Samuel that day. 25 When they came down from the high place to the town, he spoke with Saul on the roof. 26 They got up early, and as dawn was breaking, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, “Get up, so that I can send you away.” So Saul got up and the two of them, he and Samuel, went outside. 27 As they were going down to the outskirts of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to pass on before us. When he has passed, you stand here a while, so that I can make known to you the word of God.” 1 Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it over his head and kissed him and said, “Has not Yahweh anointed you as leader over his inheritance? 2 As you go from with me today, you will find two men near the burial site of Rachel in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will say to you, ‘The female donkeys that you went to search for have been found.’ Now look, your father is no longer concerned about the female donkeys and has begun worrying about you, saying, ‘What should I do about my son?’ 3 Then you will go on from there and further you will come to the oak of Tabor. There three men will meet you, who are going up to God at Bethel. One will be carrying three male kid goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and one will be carrying a skin of wine. 4 They will ask how you are doing and will give you two loaves, which you will take from their hand. 5 After this, you will come to the Gibeah of God, where there are sentries of the Philistines. Just as you enter the town there, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place, with harp, tambourine, flute, and zither before them, and they will be prophesying. 6 Then the Spirit of Yahweh will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will turn into a different person. 7 When these signs come to you, do for yourself what your hand finds to do, for God will be with you. 8 Then you will go down before me to Gilgal. Look, I am coming down to you to offer burnt offerings and to make fellowship offerings. You must wait seven days until I come to you. Then I will let you know what you should do.” 9 Just as he turned his shoulder to depart from Samuel, God changed his heart. And all these signs were fulfilled on that day. 10 When they went from there to Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them. 11 And when all who knew him formerly saw that he prophesied with prophets, the people said to one another, “What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” 12 And a man from there responded and said, “And who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb: “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 13 When he finished prophesying, he went to the high place. 14 Then Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To search for the female donkeys; and when we saw none, we went to Samuel.” 15 So Saul’s uncle said to him, “Please tell me, what did Samuel say to you?” 16 Then Saul said to his uncle, “He told us for certain that the female donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingship of which Samuel had spoken. 17 Then Samuel summoned the people to Yahweh at Mizpah, 18 and he said to the Israelites, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: ‘I brought Israel up from Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.’ 19 But you today have rejected your God who always delivers you from all of your calamities and your distresses. You have said to him, ‘No, but you must appoint a king over us!’ So then present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes and by your clans.” 20 So Samuel brought near all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected by lot. 21 Then he brought near the tribe of Benjamin according to its families, and the family of Matri was selected by lot. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen, and they sought him, but he could not be found. 22 So they inquired again of Yahweh, “Did the man come here?” And Yahweh said, “Look, he is hiding himself among the baggage.” 23 So they ran and took him from there, and when he took his stand among the people, he was taller than all the people from his shoulders and up. 24 Then Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom Yahweh has chosen? For there is no one like him among all the people!” And all the people shouted and said, “Long live the king!” 25 Then Samuel told the people the custom of the kingship, and he wrote the rules down on a scroll and laid it before Yahweh. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each to his own house. 26 And Saul also went to his house at Gibeah, and the troops whose hearts God had touched went with him. 27 However, some worthless men said, “How can this man deliver us?” So they despised him and brought no gift to him, but he kept silent.

1 Samuel,"1 Now Nahash the Ammonite went up and encamped against Jabesh Gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us and we will serve you.” 2 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition I will make a treaty with you, by gouging out the right eye of each of you, so that I can make it a disgrace for all Israel.” 3 So the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Leave us alone for seven days so that we may send messengers in all the territory of Israel, and if there is no deliverer for us, then we will come out to you.” 4 When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, they reported these things to the people. Then all the people lifted up their voices and wept. 5 Just then, Saul was coming from the field behind the cattle. Saul said, “What is the matter with the people, that they are weeping?” So they recounted to him the words of the men of Jabesh. 6 Then the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and he became very angry. 7 So he took a yoke of oxen and cut them into pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, “Whoever is not going out after Saul and after Samuel, so will it be done to his oxen.” Then the fear of Yahweh fell on the people and they went out as one man. 8 He mustered them at Bezek; the Israelites were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah were thirty thousand. 9 They said to the messengers who had come, “Thus you will say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: ‘Tomorrow deliverance for you will come when the sun is hot.’ ” When the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced. 10 The men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.” 11 And the next day Saul placed the people in three divisions. Then they came into the middle of the camp at the early morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. It happened that the remainder were scattered so that no two among them remained together. 12 Then the people said to Samuel, “Who is the one who asked, ‘Will Saul reign over us?’ Give the men to us that we may kill them.” 13 But Saul said, “No one will be put to death on this day, because today Yahweh has provided deliverance in Israel.” 14 Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal, and let us renew the kingship there.” 15 So all the people went to Gilgal and they made Saul king there before Yahweh in Gilgal. They sacrificed fellowship offerings there before Yahweh. Then Saul rejoiced there greatly along with all the men of Israel. 1 Then Samuel said to all Israel, “Look, I have listened to your voice regarding all that you have said to me, so I have set a king over you. 2 And so then here is the king walking about before you. Now I am old and gray, but my sons (look at them!) are with you; and I have walked about before you from my youth until this day. 3 Here I am! Testify against me before Yahweh and before his anointed one! Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I exploited? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe, that I may shut my eyes regarding him?–then I will restore it to you.” 4 Then they said, “You have not exploited us or oppressed us, and you have not taken anything from the hand of anyone.” 5 So he said to them, “Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed one is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” Then they said, “He is witness.” 6 Then Samuel said to the people, “Yahweh is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your ancestors up from the land of Egypt. 7 So then take your stand, so that I may judge you before Yahweh with regard to all the deeds of justice of Yahweh that he performed with both you and your ancestors. 8 “When Jacob came to Egypt, your ancestors cried out to Yahweh, so he sent Moses and Aaron, and they brought your ancestors out from Egypt and settled them in this place. 9 But they forgot Yahweh their God, so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the hosts of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. 10 So they cried out to Yahweh and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh and have served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hand of our enemies and we will serve you!’ 11 So Yahweh sent Jerub-Baal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel. Then he delivered you from the hand of your enemies all around, and you lived in security. 12 “And when you saw that Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, was coming against you, you said to me, ‘No! A king shall reign over us,’ although Yahweh your God is your king. 13 So then look! Here is the king you have chosen, for whom you have asked! Look, Yahweh has placed a king over you! 14 If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not be rebellious against what Yahweh says, and both you and the king who rules over you will follow after Yahweh your God, all will be well. 15 But, if you do not listen to the voice of Yahweh, and you rebel against what Yahweh says, then the hand of Yahweh will be against you as it was against your ancestors. 16 So then take your stand again and see this great thing that Yahweh is going to do before your eyes. 17 Is the wheat harvest not today? I will call out to Yahweh so that he still sends thunder and rain, so that you will know and will see that your wickedness is great that you have done in the eyes of Yahweh by asking for a king for yourselves.” 18 So Samuel called out to Yahweh, and Yahweh brought thunder and rain that same day, so all the people feared Yahweh and Samuel greatly. 19 Then all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God so that we will not die, because we have added to all our sins by requesting a king for ourselves.” 20 And Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear! You have done all this evil; only do not turn aside from following Yahweh. But you must serve Yahweh with all your heart. 21 And do not turn aside after the triviality, which have no value and cannot deliver, for they are triviality. 22 For Yahweh will not forsake his people for the sake of his great name, because Yahweh has decided to make you his own people. 23 Also, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh by ceasing to pray for you! I will instruct you in the good and righteous way. 24 Only fear Yahweh and serve him faithfully with all of your heart. For consider what great things he has done for you. 25 But if you continue to do wickedness, both you and your king will be swept away.” ",1 Samuel 11-12,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-samuel-11-12-9253/direct-download/tbd20070830.mp3
1 Samuel,"1 Saul was thirty years old at the beginning of his reign, and he reigned forty-two years over Israel. 2 He chose for himself three thousand from Israel. Two thousand of these were with Saul at Micmash in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. He sent away the rest of the people, each to his tent. 3 Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!” 4 And all Israel did hear, saying, “Saul has defeated the garrison of the Philistines; and also, Israel has become a stench among the Philistines!” So the people were called out after Saul at Gilgal. 5 And the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and an army as numerous as sand which is on the seashore. And they came up and encamped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven. 6 When the men of Israel saw that it was too difficult for them, because the army was hard pressed, the people hid themselves in the caves, in the thorn bushes, in the cliffs, in the vaults and in the wells. 7 Some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the army followed him trembling. 8 He waited seven days according to the appointed time Samuel determined, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the army started to slip away from him. 9 So Saul said, “Bring here to me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” Then he offered up the burnt offering. 10 Just as he finished offering the burnt sacrifice, Samuel was coming. So Saul went out to meet him and to bless him. 11 But Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul said, “Because I saw that the army was scattering from me and you did not come at the appointed time and that the Philistines had gathered at Micmash, 12 therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not yet implored the face of Yahweh.’ So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering.” 13 Then Samuel said to Saul, “You have behaved foolishly! You have not kept the command of Yahweh your God which he commanded you. For then, Yahweh would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. 14 But now, your kingdom will not endure. Yahweh has sought for himself a man according to his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him as leader over his people, because you have not kept what Yahweh commanded you.” 15 Then Samuel got up and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul mustered the people who were found with him, about six hundred men. 16 Saul and Jonathan his son and the army that remained with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, and the Philistines encamped at Micmash. 17 The raiders went out from the camp of the Philistines in three divisions. One division turned on the road to Ophrah toward the land of Shual. 18 One division turned on the road to Beth Horon, and one turned on the road toward the border overlooking the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. 19 Now no skilled craftsman could be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, “So that the Hebrews cannot make swords or spears for themselves.” 20 So all Israel went down to the Philistines, each to have his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, and his iron plowshare sharpened. 21 The charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshare and for the mattock, and a third of a shekel for the pick and for the axe, and to set the goading sticks. 22 So on the day of battle, there was not a sword or a spear found in the hands of all the army that was with Saul and Jonathan, but Saul and his son Jonathan had them. 23 Now the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Micmash. 1 One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to his armor bearer, “Come and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines which is over there.” But he did not tell his father. 2 Now Saul was staying at the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree that was in Migron, and the troops that were with him were about six hundred men. 3 Now Ahijah, the son of Ahitub (the brother of Ichabod), the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of Yahweh at Shiloh, was carrying an ephod. The troops did not know that Jonathan had gone. 4 Now between the passes where Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of the Philistines there was a crag of rock on one side and a crag of rock on the other. The name of the one was Bozez and the name of the other was Seneh. 5 The one crag on the north was opposite Micmash and the other on the south was opposite Geba. 6 So Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come, let us go over to the garrisons of these uncircumcised; perhaps Yahweh will act for us, for there is no hindrance for Yahweh to save by many or by few.” 7 And his armor bearer said, “Do all that is in your heart that you are inclined to do. I am with you all of the way! 8 Then Jonathan said, “Look, we are about to go over to the men; and we will show ourselves to them. 9 If they say to us: ‘Wait until we reach you,’ then we will stand as we are and not go up to them. 10 But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for Yahweh has given them into our hand, and this will be the sign for us.” 11 So the two of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, and the Philistines said, “The Hebrews are coming out from the holes in which they have hidden themselves.” 12 Then the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, “Come up to us and we will show you something!” Then Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up after me, for Yahweh has given them into the hand of Israel!” 13 So Jonathan went up on his hands and his feet, with his armor bearer after him. They fell before Jonathan and then his armor bearer would kill them after him. 14 So was the first attack in which Jonathan and his armor bearer killed about twenty men within about half of a furrow in an acre of an open field. 15 Then there was terror in the camp, in the open field, and among all the army of the garrison. Even the raiders trembled. The earth shook, and it became a very great panic. 16 And the lookouts of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin saw that the multitude surged back and forth. 17 Saul said to the troops that were with him, “Please call the roll and see who has gone from us.” So they called the roll and found that Jonathan and his armor bearer were not present. 18 Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring near the ark of God” (for the ark of God was at that time with the Israelites). 19 While Saul was still speaking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more, so Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand!” 20 Then Saul and all the troops who were with him were assembled on command and came up to the battle, and look! Each Philistine’s sword was against his friend; and there was a very great confusion. 21 The Hebrews who had been for the Philistines previously, who had gone up with them into the camp all around, even they joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 22 All the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, so even they pursued them closely in the battle. 23 So on that day Yahweh delivered Israel, and the battle shifted to Beth Aven. 24 Now the men of Israel were hard pressed on that day, because Saul had made the army take an oath, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats any food until evening, when I will have avenged myself on my enemies!” So none of the army tasted any food. 25 (Now all the people of the land used to go into the forest, for there was honey on the surface of the ground.) 26 When the army came to the forest, look! There was honey flowing, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the army was afraid of the solemn oath. 27 However, Jonathan had not heard about the oath of his father with the army, so he extended the end of the staff which was in his hand, and he dipped it into the honeycomb. Then he put his hand to his mouth and his eyes gleamed. 28 Then a man from the army informed him and said, “Your father made the army swear a solemn oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food today,’ ” so the army is exhausted. 29 Then Jonathan said, “My father has brought trouble on the land! See now that my eyes have brightened because I have tasted a little of this honey. 30 How much more could have been done if the troops had eaten freely today from the plunder of their enemies that they had found! For now the loss among the Philistines is not great.” 31 They defeated the Philistines that day from Micmash to Aijalon, and the troops were very weary. 32 Then the troops took the plunder: they took sheep and cattle and calves and slaughtered them on the ground and the troops ate them all with the blood. 33 So they reported it to Saul, saying, “Look! The troops are sinning against Yahweh by eating the animals with the blood!” And he said, “You have dealt treacherously! Roll to me a large stone today!” 34 Then Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the troops and say to them, ‘Bring to me each one his ox and each his sheep and slaughter them in this place and eat, but do not sin against Yahweh by eating the animals with the blood.’ ” So all the troops brought them, each leading his ox in his hand that night, and slaughtered it there. 35 Then Saul built an altar to Yahweh; it was the first altar he built to Yahweh. 36 Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and let us plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave alive a man among them.” So they said, “Do all that is good in your eyes.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.” 37 So Saul inquired of God, “Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him on that day. 38 Then Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the people, so that we find out what the sin was this day. 39 For as Yahweh lives, who delivers Israel, I swear that even if it is in Jonathan my son, he will certainly die!” But nobody from all the army answered him. 40 Then he said to all Israel, “You will be on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other.” And the army said to Saul, “Do what is good in your eyes.” 41 Then Saul said to Yahweh the God of Israel, “Render a decision perfectly.” Jonathan and Saul were chosen by lot and the people went out. 42 Then Saul said, “Let them cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan,” and Jonathan was chosen. 43 So Saul said, “Tell me what you have done.” So Jonathan told him and said, “I merely tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am, I must die.” 44 Then Saul said, “So may God do to me and more, you will certainly die today, Jonathan!” 45 But the army said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die, who accomplished this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh lives, not a hair from his head will fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the army ransomed Jonathan and he did not die. 46 Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their place. 47 So Saul took the kingship over Israel, and he fought all around against his enemies, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. He inflicted punishment against all who rebelled. 48 He acted bravely and defeated the Amalekites and rescued Israel from the hand of those who plundered it. 49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua; the names of his two daughters were as follows: the name of the firstborn was Merab and the younger was Michal. 50 The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz, and the name of the commander of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. 51 Now Kish was the father of Saul, but Ner, the father of Abner, was the son of Abiel. 52 Warfare was severe against the Philistines all the days of Saul. Whenever Saul saw anyone who was a mighty warrior or any brave man, he conscripted him into his service.

1 Samuel,"1 Then Yahweh said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn about Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel! Fill up your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen a king for myself among his sons.” 2 But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears, he will kill me.” Yahweh said, “You must take a heifer from the herd with you, and you must say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.’ 3 You will invite Jesse to the sacrifice and I will make known to you what you must do. You will anoint for me the one whom I tell you.” 4 So Samuel did what Yahweh said. He came to Bethlehem, and the elders of the city came trembling to meet him. They said, “Have you come in peace?” 5 He said, “I come in peace. I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” So he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. 6 When they came, he saw Eliab and said, “Surely his anointed one is before Yahweh!” 7 But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For God does not see what man sees, for a man looks on the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks on the heart.” 8 Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel, and he said, “This one also Yahweh has not chosen.” 9 So Jesse made Shammah pass before Samuel, but he said, “Yahweh also has not chosen this one.” 10 And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen any of these.” 11 Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all the young men here?” And he said, “The youngest still remains, but look, he is shepherding the flock.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him, for we cannot sit down until he comes here.” 12 So he sent and brought him. Now he was ruddy with beautiful eyes and of handsome appearance. And Yahweh said, “Arise, anoint him, for this is he.” 13 So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. Then the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon David from that day on. Then Samuel got up and went to Ramah. 14 Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul and an evil spirit from Yahweh tormented him. 15 So the servants of Saul said to him, “Look please, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 16 Please, let our lord command your servants who are before you! Let them seek a man skilled in playing on the lyre. When the evil spirit from God is upon you, he can play on it and you will feel better.” 17 So Saul said to his servants, “Please select a man who plays a stringed instrument well and bring him to me.” 18 One of the servants answered and said, “Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing a stringed instrument, a brave man, a warrior, prudent in speech, and handsome. And Yahweh is with him.” 19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son who is with the sheep.” 20 And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread and a skin of wine and one young goat and sent them to Saul by the hand of David his son. 21 So David came to Saul and entered his service. He loved him greatly and he became Saul’s armor bearer. 22 Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me, because he has found favor in my sight.” 23 So whenever the evil spirit from God came to Saul, David would take the stringed instrument and play it with his hand. Then it would bring relief for Saul; he would feel better and the evil spirit would depart from him. 1 The Philistines gathered their camps for battle and they were gathered at Socoh which belongs to Judah. They camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes Dammim. 2 Then Saul and the men of Israel were gathered and encamped in the valley of Elah, and they formed ranks for the battle to meet the Philistines. 3 The Philistines were standing on the hill on one side and the army of Israel was standing on the hill on the other side with the valley between them. 4 Then a champion went out from the camps of the Philistines, whose name was Goliath from Gath. His height was six cubits and a span. 5 A bronze helmet was on his head, and he was clothed with scale body armor; the weight of the body armor was five thousand bronze shekels. 6 Bronze greaves were on his legs, and a bronze javelin was slung between his shoulders. 7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam and the point of his spear weighed six hundred iron shekels. His shield bearer was walking in front of him. 8 He stood and called to the battle lines of Israel and said to them, “Why have you come out to form ranks for battle? Am I not the Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Commission for yourselves a man and let him come down to me. 9 If he is able to fight with me and he defeats me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail over him and defeat him, then you will be our servants and you will serve us.” 10 Then the Philistine said, “I hereby defy the battle lines of Israel today! Give me a man so that we may fight each other!” 11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and very afraid. 12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite. This man was from Bethlehem of Judah, and his name was Jesse. He had eight sons; in the days of Saul this man was old, yet he still walked among the men. 13 The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone and followed Saul to the battle. The names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, his second oldest was Abinadab, and the third was Shammah. 14 Now David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, 15 but David went back and forth from Saul to feed the sheep of his father in Bethlehem. 16 Now the Philistine came forward early and late, and he took his stand for forty days. 17 Then Jesse said to his son David, “Please take for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and bring them quickly to the camp for your brothers. 18 And these ten portions of cheese you will bring to the commander of the thousand; find out how your brothers are doing, and take their pledge.” 19 Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah fighting the Philistines. 20 David rose early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper, and he took the provisions and went as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampment while the troops were going to the battle line, and they raised the war cry. 21 Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle lines, one battle line against the other. 22 David left the baggage he had with him in the care of the baggage keeper, ran to the battle line, and came and asked how his brothers were doing. 23 While he was speaking to them, the champion, whose name was Goliath the Philistine from Gath, was coming up from the caves of the Philistines. He spoke just as he had previously, and David heard his words. 24 When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from his presence and were very afraid. 25 And the men of Israel said, “Did you see this man who has come up? For he is going up to defy Israel! It will be that the man who defeats him, the king will make him very rich with great wealth and will give him his daughter in marriage and will make his father’s house free in Israel.” 26 Now David had spoken to the men who were standing with him, saying, “What will be done for the man who defeats this Philistine and removes the disgrace from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he defies the battle lines of the living God?” 27 And the troops had spoken to him according to this word, saying, “So it will be done for the man who defeats him.” 28 His oldest brother Eliab heard while he was speaking to the men, and Eliab became very angry against David and said, “Why have you come down today, and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumptuousness and the evil of your heart! For you have come down in order to see the battle!” 29 David replied, “What have I done now? I merely asked a question! 30 He turned around from him to another opposite him and he spoke to him in the same way, and the people answered him as before. 31 Now the words which David had spoken were heard and they reported them to Saul, and he summoned him. 32 David said to Saul, “Do not let anyone’s heart fail concerning him! Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” 33 But Saul said to David, “You will not be able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, because you are only a boy, whereas he has been a man of war since his childhood!” 34 And David said to Saul, “Your servant has been a shepherd of the flock for his father. If the lion or the bear would come and carry off a sheep from the group, 35 I would go out after it and strike it down and rescue the sheep from its mouth. If it rose against me, I would grab it by its beard and strike it down and kill it. 36 Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he defied the battle lines of the living God.” 37 And David said, “Yahweh, who rescued me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear, will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine!” Then Saul said to David, “Go and may Yahweh be with you!” 38 Then Saul clothed David with his own fighting attire and put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with body armor. 39 Then David strapped on his sword over his fighting attire, but he tried in vain to walk around, for he was not trained to use them. So David said to Saul, “I am not able to walk with these, because I am not trained to use them.” So David removed them. 40 Then he took his staff in his hand, picked out for himself five smooth stones from the wadi, and he put them in his shepherd’s bag, in the pouch. And with his sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine. 41 Then the Philistine came on, getting nearer and nearer to David, with his shield bearer in front of him. 42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him, for he was only a boy and ruddy with a handsome appearance. 43 So the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you are coming to me with sticks?” Then the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 44 The Philistine said to David, “Come to me so that I can give your flesh to the birds of heaven and to the wild animals of the field!” 45 Then David said to the Philistine, “You are coming to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I am coming to you in the name of Yahweh of hosts, the God of the battle lines of Israel, whom you have defied! 46 This day Yahweh will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head! Then I will give the corpses of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of heaven and to the animals of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God who is for Israel. 47 And all of this assembly will know that Yahweh does not rescue with sword or with spear, for the battle belongs to Yahweh, and he will give you into our hands!” 48 When the Philistine got up and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly to the battle line to meet the Philistine. 49 Then David put his hand into the bag and took a stone from it and slung it. He struck the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground. 50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with the sling and with the stone, and he struck down the Philistine and killed him, but there was no sword in David’s hand. 51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it from its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 52 The men of Israel and Judah got up, raised the war cry, and pursued the Philistines as far as the valley and up to the gates of Ekron. So the slain of the Philistines fell on the way to Shaaraim up to Gath and as far as Ekron. 53 Then the Israelites returned from pursuing the Philistines and plundered their camp. 54 And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem and placed his weapons in his tent. 55 Now when Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Whose son is this young man, Abner?” And Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.” 56 Then the king said, “You inquire whose son this young man is.” 57 So when David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. The head of the Philistine was in his hand. 58 Then Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David said, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.” ",1 Samuel 16-17,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-samuel-1617-9256/direct-download/tbd20070904.mp3
1 Samuel,"1 David went from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s household heard, they came down to him there. 2 Every man in distress and every man who had a creditor and every embittered man gathered to him, and he became their commander. Now there were about four hundred men with him. 3 And David went up from there to Mizpah of Moab. He said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me.” 4 So he brought them before the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the days David was in the stronghold. 5 Then Gad the prophet said to David, “You should not stay in the stronghold; leave and go into the land of Judah.” So David left and came to the forest of Hereth. 6 Now Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been located. Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree at Ramah. Now his spear was in his hand and all his servants were stationed around him. 7 Then Saul said to the servants who were standing around him, “Please listen, Benjaminites! Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds? 8 For all of you have conspired against me, and no one discloses to me the making of an agreement between my son and the son of Jesse! None of you have had sympathy for me or disclosed to me that my son commissioned my servant against me to ambush me as has been done this day!” 9 But Doeg the Edomite, who was stationed among the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 10 And he inquired of Yahweh for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.” 11 So the king sent to summon Ahimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, and all his father’s household, the priests who were at Nob. So all of them came to the king. 12 Saul said, “Listen please, son of Ahitub.” He said, “Here I am, my lord.” 13 Then Saul said to him, “Why did you conspire against me, you and the son of Jesse, when you gave to him bread and a sword, and by inquiring of God for him so that he might arise against me to ambush me as has been done this day?” 14 But Ahimelech answered the king and said, “And who among all your servants is as faithful as David? He is the son-in-law of the king who moves quickly to safeguard you and is honored in your house. 15 Only today I began to inquire of God for him. Far be it from me that the king should impute anything against his servant or against my father’s household, for your servant has not known any of this matter, little or much.” 16 Then the king said, “You must certainly die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s household!” 17 So the king said to the runners who were stationed around him, “Turn and kill the priests of Yahweh, because they also support David and because they knew that he was fleeing and did not disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king were not willing to raise their hand to attack the priests of Yahweh. 18 Then the king said to Doeg, “You turn and attack the priests!” So Doeg the Edomite turned and attacked the priests himself, and on that day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. 19 And he put to the sword Nob, the city of the priests, from man to woman, from child to infant, and ox and donkey and sheep; all to the sword. 20 But, one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, whose name was Abiathar, escaped and fled after David. 21 Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of Yahweh. 22 Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day that Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would certainly tell Saul. I am responsible for the deaths of all your father’s household! 23 Stay with me! Do not fear, because he who seeks my life seeks your life. You are in good care with me.” 1 Now they told David, “Look, the Philistines are fighting in Keilah and they are raiding the threshing floors.” 2 So David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?” And Yahweh said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah.” 3 But David’s men said to him, “Look, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more if we go to Keilah to the battle lines of the Philistines?” 4 So David again inquired of Yahweh, and Yahweh answered him and said, “Get up, go down to Keilah, for I am giving the Philistines into your hand.” 5 So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines. They drove off their livestock and dealt them a heavy blow. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. 6 Now when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he went down with an ephod in his hand. 7 When it was told to Saul that David had gone to Keilah, Saul said, “God has given him into my hand, because he has shut himself in by going into a city with two barred gates. 8 Saul then summoned all of the army for the battle, to go down to Keilah to lay a siege against David and his men. 9 When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.” 10 And David said, “O Yahweh, God of Israel, your servant has clearly heard that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah to destroy the city because of me. 11 Will the rulers of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O Yahweh, God of Israel, please tell your servant!” And Yahweh said, “He will come down.” 12 Then David said, “Will the rulers of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And Yahweh said, “They will deliver you.” 13 So David and his men got up, about six hundred men, and went out from Keilah and wandered wherever they could go. When it was told to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he stopped his pursuit. 14 David remained in the wilderness, in the strongholds, and in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him continually, but God did not give him into his hand. 15 When David realized that Saul had gone out to seek his life, David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh. 16 So Jonathan the son of Saul got up and went to David at Horesh, and encouraged him through God. 17 He said to him, “Do not be afraid, for the hand of my father Saul will not find you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. My father Saul knows this also.” 18 Then the two of them made a covenant before Yahweh. David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went to his house. 19 Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the hill of Hakilah, which is south of Jeshimon? 20 So then, O king, whenever you want to come down, come down, and it will be for us to deliver him into the hand of the king.” 21 And Saul said to them, “May you be blessed by Yahweh, for you have shown me compassion! 22 Go, please, make certain again! Find out and see exactly where he is and who has seen him there! For they have said to me, ‘He is very cunning.’ 23 Look, find out all of the hiding places where he hides. Then return to me with dependable information, and I will go with you. And then if he is there in the land, then I will seek him among all the thousands of Judah.” 24 Then they got up and went to Ziph before Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah, to the south of Jeshimon. 25 And Saul and his men went to seek him, and they told David, so he went down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard this, he pursued David into the wilderness of Maon. 26 Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men went on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, while Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them. 27 But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, because the Philistines have made a raid on the land!” 28 So Saul returned from pursuing David, and he went to confront the Philistines. Therefore, they called that place the Rock of Division. 29 David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of En Gedi.

1 Samuel,"1 Then David thought to himself, “Now I will perish one day by the hand of Saul! There is nothing better for me but that I must certainly escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will desist from searching for me further in all of the territories of Israel, and so I will escape from his hand.” 2 So David got up and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, the king of Gath. 3 David settled with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each with his household. David took along his two wives Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 4 And it was reported to Saul that David had fled to Gath, so he no longer searched for him. 5 Then David said to Achish, “Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, then let them give me a place in one of the country towns that I can live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?” 6 So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day. (Therefore, Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until this day.) 7 The number of days that David lived in the countryside of the Philistines was one year and four months. 8 Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites, for they had been living in the land for a long time in the direction of Shur and as far as the land of Egypt. 9 So David struck the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive; he took the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned and came to Achish. 10 And Achish said, “Against whom have you raided today?” David said, “Against the Negev of Judah and against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites and against the Negev of the Kenites.” 11 And David did not leave alive a man or a woman to bring them back to Gath, thinking, “So that they will not report about us, saying, ‘David did thus and so.’ ” Thus was his practice all the days that he lived in the countryside of the Philistines. 12 And Achish trusted David, saying, “He has made himself utterly hated among his people in Israel, and he will be my servant forever.” 1 Now in those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war to fight against Israel. So Achish said to David, “Certainly you realize that you must go out with me in the army, you and your men.” 2 David said to Achish, “Very well, you will know what your servant can do.” Achish said to David, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.” 3 (Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him, and they had buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had expelled the mediums and the soothsayers from the land.) 4 Then the Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem, so Saul assembled all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa. 5 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly. 6 And Saul inquired of Yahweh, but Yahweh did not answer him, not by dreams or by the Urim or by the prophets. 7 So Saul said to his servants, “Search for me a woman who is a medium so that I may go to her and inquire of her.” His servants said to him, “Look there is a woman who is a medium in Endor.” 8 So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went with two of his men. And they came to the woman by night and he said, “Please consult a spirit for me through the ritual pit, and bring up for me the one whom I tell you.” 9 But the woman said to him, “Look, you know what Saul did, how he exterminated the mediums and the soothsayers from the land! Why are you setting a trap for my life to kill me?” 10 Then Saul swore to her by Yahweh, “As Yahweh lives, you will not be punished for this thing.” 11 So the woman asked, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel for me.” 12 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and the woman said to Saul, “Why did you deceive me? You are Saul!” 13 The king said to her, “Do not be afraid! What do you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up from the ground!” 14 Then he said to her, “What is his appearance?” She said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.” Then Saul realized that it was Samuel, and he knelt with his face to the ground and bowed down. 15 Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul said, “I am in distress! For the Philistines are about to make war against me, but God has turned away from me, and he does not answer me any more, not by the prophets or by the dreams. So I called to you to let me know what I should do.” 16 Then Samuel said, “Why do you ask me, since Yahweh has turned away from you and has become your enemy? 17 Yahweh has done to you just as he spoke by my hand! Yahweh has torn the kingdom from your hand and has given it to your neighbor, to David. 18 Because you did not obey Yahweh and did not carry out the fierce anger of his wrath against Amalek, therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you today. 19 And Yahweh will also give Israel with you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me, and Yahweh will also give the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.” 20 Then Saul immediately fell prostrate to the ground, and he was very afraid because of the words of Samuel; there was no more strength in him, for he had not eaten food all day and all night. 21 Then the woman came to Saul and realized that he was absolutely terrified, so she said to him, “Look, your female servant has obeyed you, and I have risked my life. I have listened to your words that you have spoken to me. 22 So then, you also please listen to the voice of your female servant, and let me set before you a morsel of bread, and you eat so that you will have strength in you when you go on your way.” 23 But he refused and said, “I will not eat!” However, his servants urged him, and the woman also. So he listened to what they said, and he got up from the ground and sat on the bed. 24 Now the woman had a fattened bull calf in the house, so she quickly slaughtered it and took flour, kneaded dough, and baked him some unleavened bread. 25 She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they got up and went away that very night. ",1 Samuel 27-28,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/1-samuel-2728-9262/direct-download/tbd20070912.mp3
1 Samuel,"1 Now the Philistines assembled all their forces at Aphek, and Israel was encamped at the spring that is in Jezreel. 2 The rulers of the Philistines were passing on according to hundreds and thousands, David and his men passing on at the rear with Achish. 3 Then the commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, “Is this not David, the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, who has been with me for days and years? I have not found anything threatening in him from the day of his desertion until this day!” 4 But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him and they said to him, “Send the man back so that he might return to his place where you have assigned him! But he will not go down with us into the battle, so that he does not become an adversary to us in the battle. By what could this fellow make himself favorable to his lord? Is it not with the heads of these men? 5 Is this not David about whom they sing in the dances, saying, ‘Saul has killed his thousands, but David his ten thousands’?” 6 So Achish called David and said to him, “As Yahweh lives, certainly you were honest, and I am pleased to have you marching with me in the campaign. For I have not found any wrong in you from the day you came to me until this day, but in the eyes of the rulers, you are not good. 7 So then, return and go in peace, so that you do not do something that displeases the rulers of the Philistines.” 8 Then David said to Achish, “But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant from the day that I entered your service until this day, that I should not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?” 9 And Achish answered and said to David, “I know that you are good in my eyes, like an angel of God! However, the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us into the battle.’ 10 So then, rise early in the morning, you and the servants of your lord who came with you. When you rise early in the morning and it is light enough for you, leave. 11 So David set out early, he and his men, to leave in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines, but the Philistines went up to Jezreel. 1 Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. When they attacked Ziklag, they burned it with fire. 2 They took captive the women who were in it, from the youngest to the oldest. They did not kill anyone, but carried them off and went on their way. 3 When David and his men came to the city, they saw, and it was burned with fire, and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive. 4 Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until there was not enough strength in them to weep. 5 Two of David’s wives had been taken captive. Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 6 And David was in a very precarious situation, for the people spoke of stoning him, for the souls of all the people were bitter, each one over his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in Yahweh his God. 7 Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring the ephod here for me.” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 8 And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Should I pursue after this band of raiders? Will I overtake them?” He said to him, “Pursue them, for you will certainly overtake them, and you will certainly rescue them.” 9 So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the Wadi Besor, but the rest remained. 10 David pursued, he and four hundred men; but two hundred men stayed because they were too exhausted to pass over the Wadi Besor. 11 Then they found an Egyptian man in the open country and brought him to David, and they gave him food and he ate; they also gave him water. 12 They gave him a slice of fig cake and two raisin cakes; he ate and this revived him, because he had not eaten food or drunk water for three days and three nights. 13 Then David said to him, “To whom do you belong, and from where are you? The young man said, “I am an Egyptian young man, a servant of an Amalekite man, but my master abandoned me because I became ill three days ago. 14 We raided the Negev of the Kerethites and that which belongs to Judah and then the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.” 15 So David asked him, “Will you take me down to this band of raiders?” He said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me and that you will not deliver me into my master’s hand! Then I will take you down to this band.” 16 So he took him down, and there they were, spread out over the surface of all the land, eating and drinking and dancing because of all of the abundant plunder which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. 17 Then David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled. 18 So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; David also rescued his two wives. 19 None of theirs was missing from the smallest to the greatest, even sons and daughters, from the plunder up to everything they had taken for themselves; David brought back everything. 20 And David took all of the sheep, and the cattle they drove along in front of that livestock, and they said, “This is David’s plunder.” 21 Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David; they had left them behind at the Wadi Besor. They went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. David came near with the people and asked them how they were doing. 22 Then all the corrupt and useless men among the men who went with David reacted and said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them anything from the plunder which we recovered, except each man may take his own wife and children. They must take them along and go!” 23 But David said to them, “You should not do so, my brothers, with what Yahweh has given to us! He has preserved us and has given the raiding band that came against us into our hand. 24 And who would listen to you regarding this matter? For as the share of the one who went down into the battle, so the share of the one who remained with the baggage will be. They will share alike.” 25 So from that day and beyond, he made it a rule and a regulation for Israel until this day. 26 Then David came to Ziklag, and he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, “Here is a gift for you from the plunder of the enemies of Yahweh!” 27 It was for those in Bethel, for those in Ramoth of the Negev, for those in Jattir, 28 for those in Aroer, for those in Siphmoth, for those in Eshtemoa, 29 for those in Racal, for those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites, for those in the towns of the Kenites, 30 for those in Hormah, for those in Bor Ashan, for those in Athach, 31 for those in Hebron, and for all the places where David and his men had roamed.

2 Samuel,"1 It happened after this that David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah?” And Yahweh said to him, “Go up.” David asked, “Where shall I go up?” And he said, “To Hebron.” 2 So David went up there along with his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 3 Also, David brought up his men who were with him, each with his household, and they settled in the towns of Hebron. 4 Then the men of Judah came, and they anointed David there as king over the house of Judah, and they told David, “The men of Jabesh-Gilead buried Saul.” 5 So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead and said to them, “May you be blessed by Yahweh because you did this loyal love with your lord, with Saul, and you buried him. 6 Now may Yahweh show loyal love and faithfulness with you. I will also show the good with you that you have done in this matter. 7 So then, let your hands be strong and be valiant, for your lord Saul is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me as king over them.” 8 But Abner the son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim. 9 He made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over Israel, all of it. 10 Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel and he reigned two years; however, the house of Judah followed David. 11 The number of days that David was king over Hebron, over the house of Judah, was seven years and six months. 12 Abner the son of Ner and the servants of Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 13 Then Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out, and they met at the pool of Gibeon. The one group sat on one side of the pool, and the other sat on the other side. 14 Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men come up and fight in our presence.” And Joab said, “Let them come up.” 15 So they came forward and passed by in number: twelve for Benjamin and for Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. 16 Then each seized his opponent by the head and each thrust his sword in the side of his opponent, so they fell together. So they called the name of that place Helkath Hazzurim, which is in Gibeon. 17 Then the battle became increasingly fierce on that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated before the servants of David. 18 The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was swift with his feet as one of the gazelles which is in the open field. 19 So Asahel pursued Abner, and he did not turn aside to the right or to the left from going after Abner. 20 Abner turned around and said, “Are you this Asahel?” And he said, “Yes.” 21 Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right or to your left; seize for yourself one of the young men, and take his belongings for yourself.” But Asahel was not willing to turn aside from him. 22 So Abner said to Asahel once again, “For your own sake, turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you down to the ground? How could I show my face to Joab your brother?” 23 But he refused to turn away, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of the spear, and the spear went out of his back. He fell there and he died on the spot. Then all who came to the place where Asahel fell and died just stood there. 24 So Joab and Abishai pursued Abner when the sun went down. And they came to the hill country of Ammah, which is before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. 25 The descendants of Benjamin rallied after Abner, and they became as one fighting group and stood on the top of a certain hill. 26 Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Will the sword devour forever? Do you not know that there will be bitterness in the end? How long will you not tell the people to turn away from pursuing their brothers?” 27 Joab said, “As God lives, for if you had not spoken, the people would surely have gone up in the morning, each one of them from following after his brother.” 28 Then Joab blew on the trumpet and all the people stopped, and they no longer pursued after Israel, and they did not fight with them again. 29 Then Abner and his men went through the Arabah all that night, and they crossed over the Jordan. They went all the forenoon and came to Mahanaim. 30 After Joab returned from pursuing Abner, he gathered all the people; nineteen of the servants of David were missing along with Asahel. 31 The servants of David had killed some of the Benjaminites among the men of Abner; three hundred and sixty men had died. 32 Then they picked up Asahel and buried him in the grave of his father, which was at Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all that night arriving in Hebron at first light. 1 The battle was prolonged between the house of Saul and the house of David, but David was growing stronger and stronger while the house of Saul was becoming weaker and weaker. 2 And sons were born to David in Hebron; his firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam from Jezreel. 3 His second was Kileab by Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; the third was Absalom the son of Maacah, who was the daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur. 4 The fourth was Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth was Shephatiah the son of Abital. 5 The sixth was Ithream by Eglah the wife of David. These were born to David in Hebron. 6 As the war between the house of Saul and the house of David was continuing, Abner was strengthening himself in the house of Saul. 7 Saul had had a concubine, and her name was Rizpah the daughter of Aiah. Then Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, “Why did you have sex with my father’s concubine?” 8 Abner became very angry at the words of Ish-Bosheth, and he said, “Am I the head of a dog which is for Judah today? Do I not continue to show loyal love with the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends? I have not let you fall into the hands of David, yet you have accused me of sin with this woman today. 9 Thus may God punish Abner, if I do not accomplish what Yahweh has sworn to David; 10 specifically, to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah from Dan to Beersheba!” 11 And Ish-Bosheth was no longer able to answer Abner because he feared him. 12 Abner sent messengers to David where he was, saying, “To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me! Look, my hand is with you to bring all of Israel over to you!” 13 He said, “Good. I will make a covenant with you. I am asking only one thing from you: You shall not see my face unless you bring Michal the daughter of Saul when you come to see me.” 14 Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul, saying, “Give me my wife Michal whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.” 15 So Ish-Bosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish. 16 But her husband went with her, weeping all along after her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go and return.” So he returned. 17 The word of Abner came to the elders of Israel, saying, “For quite some time you were seeking David as king over you. 18 So then, bring it about, because Yahweh had said to David, “Through the hand of David my servant I am about to save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.” 19 Abner also spoke privately to Benjamin. Abner also went to speak to David in Hebron, all that was good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of all the house of Benjamin. 20 Then Abner came to David in Hebron and with him were twenty men. David had prepared a feast for Abner and for the men who were with him. 21 And Abner said to David, “Let me get up and go and gather all of Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you so you can reign over all which your soul desires.” So David dismissed Abner, and he left in peace. 22 And look, the servants of David and Joab came from the raid, and they brought much plunder with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had dismissed him, and he had gone in peace. 23 When Joab and all the army that was with him came, they told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he left in peace.” 24 Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Abner came here to you? Why have you dismissed him that he actually went away? 25 You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you. He came to learn about your going out and coming in and to know all which you are doing.” 26 Then Joab went out from David, and he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from Bor Hasirah, but David did not know it. 27 When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate to speak with him in private. Then he struck him in the stomach there and he died, for he had shed the blood of Asahel his brother. 28 When David heard this afterwards, he said: “I and my kingdom are innocent before Yahweh forever for the blood of Abner the son of Ner. 29 May the blood come down on the head of Joab and all the house of his father. May the house of Joab never lack one with a bodily discharge or one with leprosy or one who grasps the distaff or one who falls by the sword or one who is lacking food.” 30 So Joab and Abishai, his brother, killed Abner because he had killed Asahel, their brother, at Gibeon in the battle. 31 David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothing and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner.” Now King David was following after the bier. 32 And they buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. 33 The king sang a lament for Abner and said, “Should Abner have died the death of a fool? 34 Your hands were not tied and your feet were not in contact with bronze fetters. You have fallen as one who falls before sons of wickedness.” Then all the people wept over him again. 35 Then all the people came to give David food. Still on that day, David swore, “May God punish me if I taste food or anything before the sun goes down.” 36 All the people noticed, and it was good in their eyes, as everything that the king did was good in the eyes of all the people. 37 Then all the people and all of Israel realized on that day that the king had not desired to kill Abner the son of Ner. 38 Then the king said to his servants, “Did you not realize that a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel? 39 I am weak today even though anointed king, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are crueler than I am. May Yahweh pay them back for doing wickedness according to their own wickedness.” ",2 Samuel 2-3,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/2-samuel-23-9265/direct-download/tbd20070917.mp3
2 Samuel,"1 When the son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his courage failed and all of Israel was horrified. 2 Two of the men, commanders of the raiding bands, were for the son of Saul. The name of one was Baanah, and the name of the other was Recab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the descendants of Benjamin; also, Beeroth was regarded as belonging to Benjamin. 3 The Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and they are resident aliens there until this day. 4 (Now Jonathan the son of Saul had a son who was crippled in the feet. He was five years old when the message of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse had picked him up and fled. It happened that as she was hurrying away to flee, he fell and became crippled. His name was Mephibosheth.) 5 When the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Recab and Baanah, set out, they came at the heat of the day to the house of Ish-Bosheth while he was taking a noontime rest. 6 They came as far as the middle of the house as if takers of wheat, and they struck him in the stomach. Then Recab and Baanah his brother escaped. 7 When they had come into the house, he was lying on his couch in his bedchamber, and they attacked him and killed him. Then they beheaded him, and they took his head and went on the way of the Arabah all night. 8 They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron, and they said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life. Yahweh has given to my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and on his offspring.” 9 Then David answered Recab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and he said to them, “As Yahweh lives, who redeemed my soul from all trouble, 10 when the one who told me, “Look, Saul is dead,” thought that he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him at Ziklag, which was as my giving the news back to him. 11 How much more when wicked men kill a righteous man in his house, on his bed! So then, shall I not seek his lifeblood from your hand, so that I may destroy you from the earth?” 12 Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them, and they cut off their hands and their feet, and they hung them at the pool at Hebron, but the head of Ish-Bosheth they took and buried in the grave of Abner at Hebron. 1 So all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and they said, “Here we are, we are your flesh and blood. 2 For some time, when Saul was king over us, you were leading Israel in and out. Yahweh had said to you, ‘You shall be the shepherd of my people Israel, and you will be the leader over Israel.’ ” 3 All the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron in the presence of Yahweh; then they anointed David as king over Israel. 4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign; he reigned forty years. 5 He reigned over Judah at Hebron for seven years and six months; and he reigned over all Israel and Judah at Jerusalem for thirty-three years. 6 The king and his men went to Jerusalem, to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land. They said to David, “You will not come here, for even the blind and the lame can turn you back, saying, ‘David cannot come here.’ ” 7 David captured the fortress of Zion, the city of David. 8 David had said, “On that day when we attack the Jebusites, one must attack the lame and the blind, those who hate the soul of David, by means of the water supply.” For thus the blind and the lame would say, “He cannot come into the house.” 9 David occupied the fortress and called it the city of David. And David built all around it from the Millo and inward. 10 David continued growing stronger and stronger, and Yahweh the God of hosts was with him. 11 So Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, along with cedar trees and craftsmen skilled in wood and in stone masonry, and they built a house for David. 12 David realized that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel and that he had exalted his kingdom because of his people Israel. 13 David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to him. 14 These are the names of the ones born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon; 15 Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia; 16 Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet. 17 When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David as king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David, but David heard and went down to the stronghold. 18 Now the Philistines had come, and they spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 19 And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up to the Philistines? Will you give them into my hands?” Yahweh said to David, “Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand.” 20 So David came to Baal Perazim and defeated them there; and David said, “Yahweh has burst through my enemies before me like the bursting of water.” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim. 21 They had left their idols there, so David and his men carried them away. 22 Once again the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 23 So David inquired of Yahweh, but he said, “You shall not go up. Rather, go around to their rear and come to them from opposite the balsam trees. 24 And it shall be that when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then pay attention, for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.” 25 So David did thus, just as Yahweh had commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines from Geba all the way to Gezer.

2 Samuel,"1 It happened afterwards that David attacked the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Metheg Ammah from the hands of the Philistines. 2 When he defeated Moab, he measured them with the cord, making them lie on the ground. He measured two cords to kill and the third cord to let live. So Moab became servants of David, bringing tribute. 3 Then David struck down Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to restore his monument at the Euphrates River. 4 David captured from him one thousand and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand foot soldiers. David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but from them he spared a hundred chariot horses. 5 When Aram of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand men of Aram. 6 David placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, so Aram became servants of David, bringing tribute. Yahweh protected David everywhere he went. 7 David took the small round gold shields which had belonged to the servants of Hadadezer, and he brought them to Jerusalem. 8 From Betah and from Berothai, the towns of Hadadezer, King David took very many bronze items. 9 When Toi, the king of Hamath, heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer, 10 Toi sent Joram his son to King David to greet him and to congratulate him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had often been at war with Toi. He brought with him objects of silver and objects of gold and objects of bronze. 11 King David dedicated them also to Yahweh along with the silver and the gold that he had dedicated from all of the nations which he had subdued; 12 from Aram and from Moab and from the Ammonites and from the Philistines and from Amalek and from the plunder of Hadadezer the son of Rehob, the king of Zobah. 13 So David made a name for himself when he returned from defeating Aram in the Valley of Salt, eighteen thousand. 14 He put garrisons in Edom; all over Edom he put garrisons, and all of Edom became servants of David. Yahweh protected David wherever he went. 15 David reigned over all of Israel, and he was administering justice and righteousness for all his people. 16 Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was secretary. 17 Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests and Seraiah was scribe. 18 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and the sons of David were priests. 1 Then David said, “Is there still anyone who is left for the house of Saul that I may show loyal love to him for the sake of Jonathan?” 2 Now Saul’s household had a servant whose name was Ziba, so they summoned him to David, and the king asked him, “Are you Ziba?” He said, “At your service!” 3 Then the king said, “But is there still anyone of Saul’s household that I may show the loyal love of God with him?” And Ziba said to the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan who is lame in the feet.” 4 The king said to him, “Where is he?” And Ziba said to the king, “He is here in the house of Makir the son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.” 5 So King David sent and brought him from the house of Makir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar. 6 So Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David. And he fell on his face and did obeisance. David said, “Mephibosheth,” and he said, “I am ready to serve you.” 7 Then David said to him, “Don’t be afraid, for I will certainly show loyal love to you for the sake of Jonathan your father, and I will restore to you all the lands of Saul your father. And you shall always eat food at my table.” 8 Then he did obeisance and said, “What is your servant that you have paid attention to the dead dog like me?” 9 David summoned Ziba the servant of Saul and said to him, “All that was Saul’s and all his household I have given to the son of your master. 10 You shall till the land for him, you and your sons and your servants; you shall bring in the produce and it shall be food for the son of your master that he may eat. But Mephibosheth the son of your master may always eat food at my table.” (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty slaves.) 11 Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my master the king commands his servant, so your servant will do.” So Mephibosheth was eating at his table as one of the sons of the king. 12 Now Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micah, and all of the dwelling of the household of Ziba became servants for Mephibosheth. 13 And Mephibosheth was living in Jerusalem, because he was continually eating at the table of the king, even though he was lame in both of his feet.

2 Samuel,"1 Afterwards the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun ruled in his place. 2 David said, “I will show loyal love with Hanun, the son of Nahash, as his father showed loyal love with me.” So David sent to console him concerning his father, by the hand of his servants. And the servants of David came to the land of the Ammonites. 3 But the commanders of the Ammonites said to Hanun their master, “In your opinion, is David honoring your father because he has sent condolences to you? Is it not in order to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it that David sent his servants to you?” 4 Then Hanun took the servants of David, and he shaved off half of their beards and cut their garments off in the middle up to their buttocks, then sent them away. 5 When they told David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Remain in Jericho until your beards have grown, and then you can return.” 6 When the Ammonites saw that they had become odious to David, the Ammonites sent word and hired Aram Beth-Rehob and Aram-Zobah, twenty thousand infantry; and they also hired the king of Maacah, a thousand men, and the men of Tob, twelve thousand men. 7 When David heard, he sent Joab and all the army of mighty warriors. 8 The Ammonites came out and drew up a battle formation at the entrance of the gate, but Aram-Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were alone in the open field. 9 When Joab saw that the battle was to be fought on two fronts, he chose from all the members of the elite troops of Israel and lined them up for battle to meet Aram. 10 The rest of the army he placed into the hand of his brother Abishai, who arranged them in battle lines to meet the Ammonites. 11 Then he said, “If Aram is stronger than I am, you must become my deliverer; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to rescue you. 12 Be strong, and let us strengthen ourselves for the sake of the people and for the sake of the cities of our God. May Yahweh do what is good in his eyes. 13 Joab and all the people who were with him moved forward into the battle against Aram, and they fled from before him. 14 When the Ammonites saw that Aram had fled, they fled from before Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem. 15 When the Arameans saw that they were defeated before Israel, they gathered themselves together. 16 Then Hadadezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates, and they came to Helam. Now Shobach, the commander of the army of Hadadezer, was at their head. 17 David was told, so he gathered all Israel and crossed over the Jordan and came to Helam. Aram arranged themselves in battle lines to meet David, and they fought with him. 18 And Aram fled before Israel, and David killed from the Arameans seven hundred chariot teams and forty thousand horsemen. He struck down Shobach, the commander of his army, and he died there. 19 When all the kings, the servants of Hadadezer, saw that he had been defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them, and Aram was afraid to help the Ammonites any longer. 1 It came about in the spring, at the time kings go out, David sent Joab and his servants with him and all of Israel. They ravaged all of the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah, but David was remaining in Jerusalem. 2 It happened late one afternoon that David got up from his bed and walked about on the roof of the king’s house, and he saw a woman bathing on her roof. Now the woman was very beautiful. 3 David sent and inquired about the woman, and someone said, “Is this not Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?” 4 Then David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he slept with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) And she returned to her house. 5 The woman became pregnant, and she sent and told David, and she said, “I am pregnant.” 6 So David sent to Joab, “Send Uriah the Hittite to me.” So Joab sent Uriah to David. 7 Uriah came to him, and David asked how Joab and the army fared and how the war was going. 8 David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” So Uriah went out from the king’s house, and a gift from the king went out after him. 9 But Uriah slept at the entrance of the king’s house with all the servants of his master and did not go down to his house. 10 They told David, “Uriah did not go down to his house.” David said to Uriah, “Are you not coming from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?” 11 Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are living in the booths; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping on the surface of the open field; and I, shall I go to my house to eat and to drink and to sleep with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I surely will not do this thing.” 12 David said to Uriah, “Remain here today, and tomorrow I will send you away.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem on that day and the next. 13 David invited him, and he ate and drank in his presence so that he became drunk, and he went out in the evening to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house. 14 And it happened in the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and he sent it by the hand of Uriah. 15 He had written in the letter, “Put Uriah in the front, in the face of the fiercest fighting, then draw back from behind him so that he may be struck down and die.” 16 When Joab was besieging the city, he put Uriah toward the place which he knew there were valiant warriors. 17 The men of the city came out and fought with Joab. Some from the army from the servants of David fell; Uriah the Hittite also died. 18 Joab sent and told David all of the news of the battle. 19 He instructed the messenger, saying, “As you are finishing to speak all the news of the battle to the king, 20 if the anger of the king rises and he says to you, ‘Why did you go near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from atop the wall? 21 Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerub-bosheth, if not a woman who threw an upper millstone on him from atop the wall and he died at Thebez? Why did you go near the wall?’ Then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.’ ” 22 Then the messenger left, and he came and told David all that Joab had sent him to say. 23 The messenger said to David, “Because the men overpowered us, the men came out to us in the field, but we forced them back to the entrance of the gate. 24 The archers shot at your servant from atop the wall, and some of the servants of the king died; your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.” 25 Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab, ‘Do not feel badly about this matter; now one and then another the sword will devour. Intensify your attack on the city and overthrow it.’ ” And he encouraged him. 26 When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned over her husband. 27 When the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his household, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing which David had done was evil in the eyes of Yahweh.

2 Samuel,"1 It happened afterwards that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon the son of David fell in love with her. 2 And Amnon was so frustrated that he felt ill because of Tamar his sister, because she was a virgin, and it was too difficult in Amnon’s eyes to do anything with her. 3 Now Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, the brother of David. (Now Jonadab was a very crafty man.) 4 And he said to him, “Why are you so sullen every morning, O son of the king? Will you not tell me?” And Amnon said to him, “I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.” 5 Then Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and appear ill. If your father comes to see you, you shall say to him, ‘Please let Tamar my sister come and give me food to eat, and let her prepare the food before my eyes, in order that I may see it and eat from her hand.’ ” 6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill, and the king came to see him. Amnon said to the king, “Please let Tamar my sister come, and let her bake two cakes before my eyes that I may eat from her hand.” 7 So David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, “Please go to the house of Amnon your brother and prepare food for him.” 8 Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother. Now he was lying down, and she took the dough and kneaded it and made cakes before his eyes, and she baked the cakes. 9 Then she took the pan and poured it out before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, “Let all the men go out from me.” So all the men went out from him. 10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food to the private room that I may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them to Amnon her brother in the private room. 11 When she brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister!” 12 Then Tamar said to him, “No, my brother! Do not force me, for such a thing has not been done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing! 13 As for me, where should I take my disgrace? You will be as one of the fools in Israel. So please, speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.” 14 But he was not willing to listen to her voice. He was stronger than she, and he forced her and lay with her. 15 Then Amnon hated her very deeply, for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. So Amnon said to her, “Get up and go.” 16 She said to him, “No, because this evil in sending me away is greater than the other you have done to me.” But he was not willing to listen to her. 17 Then he called his young man who was serving him and said, “Please send this woman from me to the outside, and bolt the door behind her!” 18 Now there was a long-sleeved robe on her, for so they clothed the daughters of the king who were virgins, in robes. His servant put her outside, and he bolted the door behind her. 19 Tamar put ashes on her head, and she tore the long-sleeved robe which was on her. She put her hand on her head, and she went away, crying out as she went. 20 Absalom her brother said to her, “Was Amnon your brother with you? But now, my sister, be quiet; he is your brother. Do not take this matter to heart.” So Tamar remained a desolate woman in the house of Absalom her brother. 21 Now King David heard all these things, and he became very angry. 22 Absalom did not speak with Amnon either bad or good, for Absalom hated Amnon over the matter when he raped Tamar his sister. 23 About two full years later, Absalom’s shearers were in Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom summoned all the sons of the king. 24 Then Absalom went to the king and said, “Look, here are your servant’s shearers; please let the king and his servants go with your servant. 25 The king said to Absalom, “No my son, not all of us shall go, so that we not be a burden to you.” And he urged him, but he was not willing to go, but he blessed him. 26 So Absalom said, “But will you not let Amnon my brother go with us?” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?” 27 But Absalom pressed him, so he sent Amnon with him and all of the sons of the king. 28 Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “Please watch. At the moment the heart of Amnon is tipsy with wine, then I shall say to you, ‘Strike Amnon down,’ and you shall kill him! Don’t be afraid. Is it not I myself who has commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant! 29 So Absalom’s servants did to Amnon just as Absalom commanded, and all the sons of the king got up, and each mounted his mule and fled. 30 While they were on the way, the message came to David, “Absalom has killed all the sons of the king, and not one of them was left.” 31 Then the king rose and tore his garments, and he lay on the ground, and all his servants standing by were tearing their garments. 32 Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, the brother of David, responded and said, “My lord should not think that all the young men, the sons of the king, are dead, because only Amnon is dead. Absalom was talking about it, as it was being determined from the day he raped Tamar his sister. 33 So then, let not my lord the king set his heart on this matter, thinking, ‘All the sons of the king are dead,’ for only Amnon alone is dead.” 34 So Absalom fled, and the young man who was keeping watch lifted up his eyes and saw, and there were many people coming from the road behind him from the side of the mountain. 35 Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the sons of the king have come. According to the word of your servant, so it has come about.” 36 When he finished speaking, look, the sons of the king came and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also, the king and all his servants wept a very great weeping. 37 Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, the king of Geshur. David mourned over his son day after day. 38 But Absalom had fled and went to Geshur, and he was there three years. 39 King David longed to go out to Absalom, for he was consoled that Amnon had died. 1 Joab the son of Zeruiah realized that the mind of the king was on Absalom. 2 So Joab sent to Tekoa and took from there a wise woman, and he said to her, “Please pretend to mourn and put on garments of mourning. You should not anoint yourself with oil, and you must act like this woman who has been mourning over the dead for a long time. 3 Then you must go to the king and speak to him according to this word.” Thus Joab put the words in her mouth. 4 So the Tekoite woman spoke to the king, and she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance. She said, “Help me, O king!” 5 Then the king asked her, “What do you want?” And she said, “Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead. 6 Your servant had two sons, and they both fought in the open field, and there was no one to part them. One struck the other and killed him. 7 And look, all of the family has risen up against your servant, and they said, ‘Give up the one who struck his brother, that we may kill him in exchange for the life of his brother whom he murdered. We will also wipe out the heir,’ and so they would put out my embers which remain, by not preserving for my husband a name and a remnant on the face of the earth.” 8 Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I myself will give the command concerning you.” 9 The Tekoite woman said to the king, “On me, my lord the king, is the guilt, and on the house of my father, but the king on his throne is innocent.” 10 The king said, “Whoever has spoken to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you again.” 11 Then she said, “Please may the king remember Yahweh your God, to prevent the increase of blood avengers who kill, so that they not wipe out my son.” He said, “As Yahweh lives, surely not one hair shall fall from your son to the ground.” 12 The woman said, “Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.” And he said, “Speak.” 13 The woman said, “But why have you plotted like this against the people of God? By speaking this word, he is guilty not to bring back his banished one. 14 For we must certainly die, and we are as the waters spilled to the ground which cannot be gathered. God will not take a life but devises plans for a banished person not to be cast out from him. 15 Now I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, because the people made me afraid, and your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the king, perhaps the king will grant the request of his servant. 16 For the king will listen, to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who seeks to destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.’ 17 Your servant also thought, ‘May the word of my lord the king bring rest, for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king, to sense what is good and what is bad.’ May Yahweh your God be with you.” 18 The king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not withhold from me a thing which I am about to ask you.” The woman said, “Please let my lord the king speak.” 19 The king asked, “Was the hand of Joab with you in all of this?” The woman answered and said, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, surely one cannot go to the right or to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken. Yes, your servant Joab himself commanded me, and he put all of these words in the mouth of your servant. 20 In order to change the situation, your servant Joab did this thing. But my lord has wisdom, as the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all that is on the earth.” 21 Then the king said to Joab, “Look, please, I will grant this thing. Go and bring back the young man Absalom.” 22 Joab fell with his face to the ground and did obeisance. And he blessed the king, and he said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant.” 23 Then Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 24 The king said, “Let him go over to his house, and he may not see my face.” So Absalom went over to his house, and did not see the face of the king. 25 As far as Absalom, there was not a more handsome man in all of Israel to admire so much; from the sole of his foot up to his crown, there was no physical defect on him. 26 When he shaved his head, it would happen every year, which he did because it was heavy on him, he would shave it off and weigh the hair of his head: two hundred shekels by the king’s weight. 27 Three sons were born to Absalom and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a woman beautiful of appearance. 28 Absalom lived in Jerusalem two full years, but he did not see the face of the king. 29 So Absalom sent for Joab, in order that he send him to the king, but he was not willing to go to him. He sent again a second time, but he was not willing to go. 30 So he said to his servants, “Look at the tract of land of Joab next to mine, for he has barley plants there. Go, set it ablaze with fire.” So the servants of Absalom set the tract of land ablaze with fire. 31 Then Joab got up and went to Absalom, to the house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my tract of land ablaze with fire?” 32 Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I have sent to you, saying, ‘Come here that I may send you to the king to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there.” ’ So then, let me see the face of the king; if there is guilt in me, then let him kill me.” 33 So Joab went to the king and he told him. Then he summoned Absalom, and he came to the king, and he bowed down to him with his face to the ground before the king. Then the king kissed Absalom.

2 Samuel,"1 It happened afterward that Absalom made himself a chariot with horses and fifty men running before him. 2 Absalom used to rise early in the morning, and he stood beside the road at the gate; anyone who had a legal dispute to bring to the king for judgment Absalom would call to him and say, “Where are you from?” And he would say, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.” 3 Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your case is good and right, but for you there is no hearing with the king.” 4 Then Absalom would say, “Oh, that someone would appoint me as judge in the land, that anyone might come to me who had a legal dispute or a case, and I would give him justice.” 5 It happened whenever anyone drew near to do obeisance to him, that he would stretch his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. 6 Absalom did like this to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel. 7 It happened at the end of four years that Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow which I have made to Yahweh in Hebron, 8 for your servant made a vow while I was staying in Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘If Yahweh will indeed let me return to Jerusalem, then I will worship Yahweh.’ ” 9 Then the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he got up and went to Hebron. 10 Then Absalom sent scouts throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “When you hear the sound of the trumpet, you shall shout ‘Absalom has become king in Hebron!’ ” 11 Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom as invited guests, going in their innocence as they did not know anything. 12 Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, the advisor of David, from his city Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. The conspiracy grew in strength, and the people were going and increasing with Absalom. 13 Then the messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.” 14 Then David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, “Get up and let us flee, for there will be no escape for us from Absalom! Hurry to go, otherwise he will come quickly and overtake us! And he will bring disaster on us and evil! He will attack the city with the edge of the sword!” 15 Then the servants of the king said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king chooses, your servants are ready to act!” 16 The king went out with all his household following him, but the king left behind ten concubines to look after the house. 17 So the king went out with all the people following him, and they stopped at the last house. 18 All his servants were passing by him: all of the Kerethites and all of the Pelethites and all of the Gittites—six hundred men who had followed him from Gath—passing before the king. 19 The king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why are you also coming with us? Return and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner; moreover, you are an exile. You are far from your place. 20 Yesterday when you came and today, I have caused you to wander by going with us. Now I am going to where I am going; return and let your brothers return. May loyal love and faithfulness be with you.” 21 But Ittai answered the king and said, “As Yahweh lives and my lord the king lives, surely in the place wherever my lord the king shall be, if for death or if for life, surely there your servant will be.” 22 Then David said to Ittai, “Go and pass over.” So Ittai the Gittite passed over and all his men and all of the little children who were with him. 23 All of the land was weeping with a loud voice as all the people were passing by and the king was crossing through the Wadi Kidron, and all the people were passing on the road to the wilderness. 24 Suddenly Zadok was there, and all of the Levites with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set the ark of God down, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people passed out of the city. 25 The king said to Zadok, “Let the ark of God return to the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Yawheh, he will let me return and let me see him in his dwelling place. 26 But if he says, ‘I take no pleasure in you,’ then I am ready. Let him do to me that which is good in his eyes. 27 Then the king said to Zadok the priest, “Are you a seer? Return to the city in peace, with Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons with you. 28 See, I am waiting at the fords of the wilderness until a word comes from you all to inform me.” 29 So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and they remained there. 30 Now David was going up on the Ascent of the Olives, weeping as he went, with his head covered and going barefoot. All the people who were with him each covered their head and wept as they went. 31 Now David was told, “Ahithophel was among the conspirators with Absalom.” Then David said, “Please frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel, O Yahweh.” 32 It happened that as David was coming up to the summit where he used to worship God, suddenly Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him. His coat was torn and dirt was on his head. 33 David said to him, “If you move on with me, you will be a burden to me, 34 but if you want to return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I am your servant, O king. I used to be a servant of your father, but from then and now I will be your servant,’ then you can frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel for me. 35 Will not Zadok and Abiathar the priests be with you there? It shall be that all the words you hear from the house of the king you shall tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 36 Look, there with them are their two sons, Ahimaaz of Zadok and Jonathan of Abiathar. You shall send to me by means of them all the words that you hear.” 37 So Hushai the friend of David came to the city as Absalom was entering Jerusalem. 1 Now David passed a little from beyond the summit, and suddenly Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him with a pair of saddled donkeys; on them were two hundred loaves of bread and a hundred raisin cakes, with a hundred summer fruits and a skin of wine. 2 The king said to Ziba, “What do you want to accomplish by bringing these?” And Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on; the bread and the summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for the faint in the wilderness to drink. 3 Then the king said, “Where is the son of your lord?” And Ziba said to the king, “He is living in Jerusalem for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel shall return the kingdom of my father to me.’ ” 4 The king said to Ziba, “Look, all that was Mephibosheth’s is yours.” Ziba said, “I hereby do obeisance; may I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king.” 5 King David came up to Bahurim and suddenly a man from there was coming out from the family of the house of Saul, and his name was Shimei the son of Gera. He was cursing as he came out. 6 And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David and at all the people and at all the mighty warriors on his right and on his left. 7 Shimei said while cursing him, “Go out, go out, you man of bloodshed, you man of wickedness. 8 Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the household of Saul whom you have supplanted as king, and Yahweh has given the kingship into the hand of Absalom your son. Look, you are in disaster for you are a man of blood.” 9 Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.” 10 The king said, “What do we have in common, sons of Zeruiah? If he curses because Yahweh has said to him ‘Curse David,’ who can say, “Why have you done this?” 11 David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Look, my son who came out of my loins is seeking my life. Now as far as this Benjaminite, leave him alone and let him curse, for Yahweh has spoken to him. 12 Perhaps Yahweh will look in my eye and repay good for me in place of his curse this day. 13 Then David and his men went on the road, with Shimei going on the side of the hill beside him, cursing as he went. He threw stones beside him and threw dust in the air. 14 When the king and all of the people who were with him arrived, he was weary, so he recovered there. 15 Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, had come to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. 16 When Hushai the Arkite the friend of David came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king, long live the king!” 17 Absalom said to Hushai, “This is your loyal love with your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?” 18 Then Hushai said to Absalom, “No, rather, whom Yahweh and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, to him I will be, and with him I will remain. 19 Furthermore, for whom have I served? Is it not in the presence of his son that I have served before your father? So shall I serve you!” 20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your advice. What shall we do?” 21 And Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go to the concubines of your father whom he left behind to watch over the house, then all of Israel will hear that you made yourself odious to your father, and all of your followers will be motivated!” 22 Then they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he went in to the concubines of his father before the eyes of all Israel. 23 The counsel that Ahithophel gave in those days was regarded as when a man inquired of the word of God, so all the counsel of Ahithophel was esteemed both by David and by Absalom.

2 Samuel,"1 Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Please let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will set out and pursue after David tonight. 2 I will come upon him while he is weary and weak. I will startle him, and all of the people who are with him will flee. Then I will strike down the king while he is alone. 3 Then I will return all the people to you; when all have returned, the man whom you are seeking will be dead, but all the people will be safe.” 4 The word was right in the eyes of Absalom and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel. 5 Then Absalom said, “Please call also for Hushai the Arkite, and let us hear what he has to say also.” 6 So Hushai came to Absalom, who said to him, “Shall we do according to this word that Ahithophel has spoken? If not, then you tell us.” 7 Then Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel gave is not good at this time.” 8 Hushai continued, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty warriors and they are enraged as a bear robbed of her offspring in the field. Your father is a man of war, so he will not spend the night with the troops. 9 Now he has hidden himself in one of the caves or in one of the places. At the moment he falls on them the first time, whoever hears the report will say, ‘There has been a defeat among the people who follow after Absalom.’ 10 And he is also a valiant warrior, whose heart is like the heart of the lion. He will certainly melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty warrior and those who are with him are valiant warriors. 11 I give the advice that all of Israel from Dan to Beersheba should be completely gathered to you, as the sand which is on the seashore for abundance, with you personally going into the battle. 12 Then we will come to him in one of the places where he may be found, and we shall come upon him as the dew falls on the ground. He and all the men who are with him will not survive, not even one! 13 Even if he withdraws to a city, all Israel will bring up ropes to that city, and they will drag him away to the valley until there is not even a pebble to be found.” 14 Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than the advice of Ahithophel.” (Now Yahweh had ordained to frustrate the good counsel of Ahithophel in order for Yahweh to bring misery upon Absalom). 15 Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Thus and so Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, but thus and so I have advised. 16 So then, send quickly and tell David, ‘Don’t spend the night at the fords of the wilderness! Moreover, by all means cross over lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.’ ” 17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel, so a servant girl used to go and tell them, then they would go and tell King David, for they were not able to be seen coming to the city. 18 But a young man saw them and told Absalom, so both of them went quickly and came to the house of a man at Bahurim. Now he had a well in his courtyard, so they went down there. 19 Then the woman took and spread a covering over the opening of the well; then she spread out dried grain on it, so nothing was discovered. 20 When the servants of Absalom came to the woman at the house, they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And she said to them, “They crossed over the brook of water.” So they searched but could not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem. 21 After they left, they came up from the well and went and told King David. They said to David, “Set out and cross over the water quickly, for thus Ahithophel has advised against you.” 22 So David and all the people who were with him set out, and they crossed over the Jordan until morning light until there was no one missing who had not crossed over the Jordan. 23 When Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled the donkey, and he set out and went up to his house in his city. After he set his house in order, he hanged himself, and he died and was buried in the tomb of his ancestors. 24 Now David had come to Mahanaim, and Absalom had crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 25 Absalom had appointed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who had married Abigail the daughter of Nahash the sister of Zeruiah, the mother of Joab. 26 Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. 27 Just as David had arrived in Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites and Makir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim 28 brought beds and basins and objects of pottery, as well as wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, 29 honey, curds, sheep, cheese, and cattle for David and for the people who were with him to eat. For they had thought, “The troops are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.” 1 Then David mustered the people who were with him, and he appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. 2 David sent forth a third of the troops under the command of Joab, and a third under the command of Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the remaining third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the troops, “I, even I, will certainly go out with you.” 3 Then the troops said, “You will not go out, for if we must flee, then they will not care about us; even if half of us die, they will not care about us, but now, you are like ten thousand of us. And so then, it is better for us that you be in the city to help.” 4 The king said to them, “I will do what seems good in your eyes.” So the king stood at the side of the gate while all of the troops went out by hundreds and by thousands. 5 The king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “With respect to the young man Absalom, deal gently for me.” And all the troops heard when the king ordered all of the commanders concerning the matter of Absalom. 6 The army went out to the field to meet Israel, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim. 7 The army of Israel was defeated there before the servants of David, and the defeat there was great on that day: twenty thousand. 8 The battle there was spreading over the surface of all the land, and the forest devoured more among the army than the sword did on that day. 9 Absalom was found in the presence of the servants of David as he was riding on the mule. The mule went under the thicket of the great oak tree, and his head was caught in the tree. He was left hanging between heaven and earth, and the mule which was under him went on. 10 When a certain man saw it, he told Joab, and he said, “Look, I saw Absalom hanging in the oak tree!” 11 Then Joab said to the man who was telling him, “Look, if you saw, why did you not strike him down to the ground there? I would have gladly given you ten pieces of silver and a leather belt.” 12 The man said to Joab, “Even if I felt the weight of a thousand pieces of silver in my palms, I would not have sent my hand against the son of the king, for in our ears the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Whoever you may be, protect the young man Absalom.’ 13 If I had dealt treacherously against his life, and there is not any matter hidden from the king, you would have presented yourself aloof.” 14 Joab said, “No longer will I wait in your presence.” Then he took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak tree. 15 Then ten of the young men who bore the weapons of Joab surrounded him and struck and killed Absalom. 16 Then Joab blew on the trumpet and the troops returned from pursuing after Israel, for Joab kept back the troops. 17 They took Absalom and they threw him into the large pit in the forest and raised a very great heap of stones over him. Then all of Israel fled, each to his tent. 18 (Now Absalom had taken and set up for himself in his lifetime a stone pillar that is in the valley of the king, because he said, “I have no son in order to remember my name,” and he called the stone pillar by his name. It is called the monument of Absalom until this day). 19 Now Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Please let me run and bring the good news to the king that Yahweh has vindicated him from the hand of his enemies.” 20 Joab said to him, “You will not be a man bringing good news this day! You may bring good news on another day, but today you will not be bringing good news because the king’s son is dead.” 21 Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen”; then the Cushite bowed down to Joab and ran off. 22 Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again said to Joab, “Come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite.” Joab asked, “Why are you wanting to run, my son, when for you there is no messenger’s reward?” 23 “Come what may, I want to run.” He said to him, “Run,” so Ahimaaz ran on the road on the plain, and he passed the Cushite. 24 Now David was sitting between the two gates, and the sentinel went up to the roof of the gate by the wall and he lifted up his eyes and watched, and look, a man was running by himself. 25 The sentry called and told the king, and the king said, “If he is alone, good news is in his mouth.” He kept coming closer. 26 Then the sentinel saw another man running, so the sentinel called to the gatekeeper and said, “Look, a man running alone.” The king said, “This one also is bringing good news.” 27 The sentinel said, “I am seeing that the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zakok.” The king said, “He is a good man; he will come, for good news.” 28 Then Ahimaaz called and said to the king, “Peace.” He bowed down to the king with his face to the ground, and he said, “May Yahweh your God be blessed, who has delivered the men who raised their hand against my lord the king.” 29 The king said, “Is it peace for the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz said, “I saw the great commotion when Joab the servant of the king sent your servant, but I do not know what it was all about.” 30 Then the king said, “Turn aside, take your place here,” so he turned aside and waited. 31 Suddenly the Cushite arrived and said, “May my lord the king receive the good news, for Yahweh has vindicated you today from the power of all who stood up against you.” 32 The king said to the Cushite, “Is it peace for the young man Absalom?” Then the Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you to harm you be like the young man!” 33 The king was upset, and he went up to the upper room of the gate and wept. He said as he went, “My son, Absalom, my son, my son, Absalom. If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son.” ",2 Samuel 17-18,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/2-samuel-1718-9274/direct-download/tbd20070928.mp3
2 Samuel,"1 And it was told to Joab that the king was weeping and he mourned over Absalom, 2 so the victory turned to mourning on that day for all the army, because they had heard that day, “The king is grieving over his son.” 3 The army came secretly into the city on that day because the army was disgraced when they fled in the battle, 4 and because the king had covered his face and cried with a loud voice, “My son, Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son.” 5 Then Joab came to the king’s house and said, “Today you have humiliated the faces of all of your servants who have saved your life this day, and the life of your sons and your daughters, the life of your wives, and the life of your concubines, 6 by loving those who hate you and hating those who love you. Indeed, you have made clear this day that you have no regard for your commanders or officers, for I have realized today that were Absalom alive, and all of us were dead, then that would have been right in your eyes! 7 So then, get up and go out and speak kindly to your servants, for I swear by Yahweh, if you do not go out, no man will lodge this night with you, and this disaster will be greater for you than any disaster that has come upon you from your childhood until now!” 8 So the king got up and he sat in the gate, and they told all the army, “Look, the king is sitting in the gate.” Then all the army came before the king; whereas all of Israel had fled, each to his tent. 9 Then it happened that all the people were disputing among all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and he saved us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled from the land because of Absalom. 10 Now Absalom whom we anointed as king over us has died in the battle; so then, why are you taking no action to restore the king?” 11 Then King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah: ‘Why are you last to bring back the king to his house? The talk of all Israel has come to the king in his house. 12 My brothers, you are my bones and you are my flesh. Why should you be the last to bring back the king?’ 13 To Amasa you shall say: ‘Are you not my bones and my flesh? May God punish me if you are not the commander of my army before me forever, in place of Joab.’ ” 14 So he turned the heart of all the men of Judah as one man, and they sent word to the king, “Return, you and all your servants.” 15 Then the king returned and he came to the Jordan; Judah had come to Gilgal to come to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan. 16 Then Shimei the son of Gera, the son of the Benjaminite, who was from Bahurim quickly came down with the men of Judah to meet King David, 17 and a thousand men were with him from Benjamin. Too, Ziba the servant of the household of Saul and fifteen of his sons and twenty of his servants were with him, and they rushed to the Jordan before the king. 18 The crossing took place to bring the household of the king over and to do good in his eyes. Then Shimei the son of Gera fell before the king when he crossed over the Jordan, 19 and he said to the king, “May not my lord hold me guilty, and may you not remember how your servant did wrong on the day that my lord the king went out from Jerusalem, by taking it to heart! 20 For your servant knows that I have sinned; look, I have come this day as the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.” 21 Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah responded and said, “Because of this, should not Shimei be put to death, for he cursed the anointed one of Yahweh?” 22 Then David said, “What is it to me or to you, sons of Zeruiah, that you should be an adversary today? Should anyone be put to death in Israel? Do I not know today that I am king over Israel?” 23 Then the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die,” and so the king swore to him. 24 Now, Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; he had not taken care of his feet nor trimmed his moustache nor washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he came back in peace. 25 It happened that when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?” 26 Then he said, “My lord the king, my servant deceived me, for your servant had said, ‘Let me saddle the donkey that I may ride on her and go with the king,’ for your servant is lame. 27 But he slandered against your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like the angel of God; do as you see fit..” 28 For there was no one in all the house of my father who were not doomed to death before my lord the king, but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. Do I have any righteousness any longer except to cry out to the king?” 29 Then the king said to him, “Why should you speak any more about the matter? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land.” 30 Then Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him take the whole thing, since my lord the king has come safely to his house.” 31 Then Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and crossed with the king over the Jordan to escort him through the Jordan. 32 Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years old. Now he had provided the king with food while he was staying at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. 33 The king said to Barzillai, “You cross over with me, and I will provide for you to dwell with me in Jerusalem.” 34 Then Barzillai said to the king, “What are the days of the years of my life, that I should go with the king to Jerusalem? 35 I am eighty years old today. Can I discern between good and bad? Or can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Or can I still hear the voice of singing men and women? Why should your servant be a burden any longer to my lord the king? 36 Your servant shall go over the Jordan with the king a little way, but why should the king recompense me with this reward? 37 Please let your servant return, and let me die in my city in the tomb of my father and my mother. Here is your servant Kimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him that which is good in your eyes.” 38 The king said, “Let Kimham go over with me, and I will do for him the good in your eyes, and all that you desire of me I will do for you.” 39 Then all the people crossed over the Jordan, and the king crossed and kissed Barzillai and blessed him; then he returned to his place. 40 The king went over to Gilgal, and Kimham went over with him. All the people of Judah went over with the king, and half of the people of Israel too. 41 Suddenly, all the men of Israel were coming to the king. They said to the king, “Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen away and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, with all the men of David?” 42 Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is my close relative! Why are you this angry over this matter? Have we by any means eaten anything from the king? Did we take by any means anything that was not ours?” 43 Then the people of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, “I have ten times as much in the king, moreover in David I have more than you. Why did you treat me with contempt by not giving me first chance to bring back my king?” But the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the word of the men of Israel. 1 Now a man of wickedness was found there whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. He blew the horn and said, “There is no share for us in David, and there is no inheritance for us in the son of Jesse; each to his tents, O Israel!” 2 Then all the men of Israel went up from following after David, following instead after Sheba the son of Bicri, but the men of Judah stuck to their king from the Jordan up to Jerusalem. 3 David went up to his house in Jerusalem, then the king took the ten concubines whom he had left to look after the house, and he put them under confinement. However, he provided for them, but he did not sleep with them. So they were confined until the day of their death, like a lifetime of widowhood. 4 Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon for me the men of Judah within three days, and be here yourself.” 5 So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he tarried more than the appointed time which he had set for him. 6 Then David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bicri will do us more harm than Absalom. You take the servants of your lord and pursue after him, lest he find fortified cities for himself and escape from us.” 7 Then the men of Joab, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty warriors went out after him; they went out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba the son of Bicri. 8 They were near the big rock that is in Gibeon, and Amasa came before them. Joab was dressed in his military clothing, with a utility belt on him and a sword strapped to his waist in its scabbard. Now he went out, and it fell out. 9 Then Joab said to Amasa, “Is it peace, O you my brother?” Then the right hand of Joab took hold of the beard of Amasa as if to kiss him. 10 Now Amasa was not on his guard against the sword that was in Joab’s hand, and he struck him with it into the stomach, and his entrails poured out to the ground. He did not strike him again, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bicri. 11 A young man stood over him, from the young men of Joab, and he said, “Whoever takes delight in Joab and whoever is for David, follow after Joab.” 12 Now Amasa was wallowing in the blood in the middle of the highway; when the man saw that all the people stood there, he turned Amasa over from the highway into the field, and he threw a garment over him because he had seen that all who had come by him had stopped. 13 After he was removed from the highway, all the men passed by after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of Bicri. 14 (He had passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel and Beth Maacah; now all of the Berites had been treated badly, so they also followed after him.) 15 And they came and besieged him in Abel Beth Maacah. They threw up a siege ramp against the city, and they stood against the ramparts. And all the army who were with Joab were battering to cause the wall to fall. 16 Then a wise woman from the city called out, “Listen, listen! Please speak to Joab to come near here so that I may speak to you.” 17 Then he came near to her, and the woman asked, “Are you Joab?” And he said, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your servant.” He said, “I am listening.” 18 Then she said, “In former times, they would always say, ‘By all means, let them inquire in Abel,’ and so they settled things. 19 I am one of the faithful representatives of Israel. You are seeking to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow the inheritance of Yahweh?” 20 Then Joab answered and said, “Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow or I should destroy. 21 That is not the matter. But a man from the mountains of Ephraim, whose name is Sheba the son Bicri, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Give only him to us, and I will depart from the city.” The woman said to Joab, “Look, his head is being thrown down to you over the wall.” 22 The woman went to all of the people with her wise plan, so they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bicri and threw it to Joab. Then he blew the horn and dispersed from the city, each to his tent. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king. 23 Now Joab was over all the army of Israel and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Carites and over the Pelethites. 24 Adoram was over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder. 25 Shiya was secretary, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests. 26 Also Ira the Jairite was priest for David.

Ruth,"1 And it happened in the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man from Bethlehem of Judah went to reside in the countryside of Moab—he and his wife and his two sons. 2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephraimites from Bethlehem in Judah. And they went to the countryside of Moab and remained there. 3 But Elimelech the husband of Naomi died and she was left behind with her two sons. 4 And they took for themselves Moabite wives. The name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other was Ruth. And they lived there about ten years. 5 But both Mahlon and Kilion died, and the woman was left without her two sons and without her husband. 6 And she got up, she and her daughters-in-law, and returned from the countryside of Moab, because she had heard in the countryside of Moab that Yahweh had come to the aid of his people to give food to them. 7 So she set out from the place where she was and her two daughters-in-law with her, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. 8 But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, each of you return to her mother’s house. May Yahweh show kindness to you just as you did with the dead and with me. 9 May Yahweh grant that you find a resting place, each in the house of her husband.” And she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and cried.

Judges,"1 The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over and make war against the Ammonites, and why did you not call us to go with you? We will burn down your house over you with fire.” 2 And Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were engaged in great conflict with the Ammonites; I called you, but you did not deliver me from their hand. 3 I saw that you would not deliver us; I risked my own life, and I crossed over to the Ammonites, and Yahweh gave them into my hand. Why have you come up to me this day to fight against me?” 4 Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead, and he made war with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh.” 5 Then Gilead captured the fords of the Jordan from Ephraim, and whenever a fugitive of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead said to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” When he said, “No,” 6 they said to him, “Please say Shibboleth,” and if he said, “Sibboleth”—because he could not pronounce it correctly—they grabbed him and executed him at the fords of Jordan. At that time forty-two thousand from Ephraim fell. 7 Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. 8 After him Ibzan from Bethlehem judged Israel. 9 He had thirty sons. He gave his thirty daughters away in marriage outside his clan and brought in from outside thirty young women for his sons. He judged Israel for seven years. 10 Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem. 11 After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years. 12 Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. 13 After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons that rode on seventy male donkeys. He judged Israel for eight years. 15 Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon, in the land of Ephraim in the hill country of the Amalekites. 1 And again, the Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and Yahweh gave them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. 2 There was a certain man from Zorah, from the tribe of the Danites, and his name was Manoah; his wife was infertile and did not bear children. 3 And an angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman, and he said to her, “Behold, you are infertile and have not borne children, but you will conceive and bear a son. 4 So then, be careful and do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, 5 because you will conceive and bear a son. No razor will touch his head, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth. And it is he who will begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.” 6 And the woman came and told her husband, saying, “A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him from where he came, and he did not tell me his name. 7 And he said to me, ‘Look, you will conceive and bear a son, so then, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, for the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth until the day of his death.’ ” 8 Then Manoah prayed to Yahweh and said, “Excuse me, my Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent again come to us and teach us what we should do concerning the boy who will be born.” 9 And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and an angel of God came again to the woman; she was sitting in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her. 10 The woman quickly ran and told her husband, and she said to him, “Look! The man who came to me the other day appeared to me.” 11 So Manoah got up and went after his wife, and he came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man that spoke to the woman?” And he said, “I am.” 12 And Manoah said to him, “Now when your words come true, what will be the boy’s manner of life and work?” 13 And the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, “Let the woman be attentive to all that I said. 14 She should not eat of anything that comes from the vine, or drink wine or strong drink, or eat anything unclean; she should keep all that I commanded.” 15 And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, “Please stay, and let us prepare a young goat for you.” 16 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, “If you keep me, I will not eat your food, but if you prepare a burnt offering for Yahweh, you can offer it (for Manoah did not know that he was an angel of Yahweh).” 17 And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, “What is your name so that when your words come true we may honor you?” 18 But the angel of Yahweh said to him, “Why do you ask my name? It is too wonderful.” 19 And Manoah took the young goat and the grain offering, and he offered it to Yahweh on the rock, to the one who performs miracles. And Manoah and his wife were watching. 20 And when the flame went up toward the heaven from the altar, the angel of Yahweh went up in the flame of the altar to heaven while Manoah and his wife were watching. And they fell on their faces to the ground. 21 The angel of Yahweh did not appear again to Manoah and his wife, and then Manoah knew that he was a messenger of Yahweh. 22 And Manoah said to his wife, “We will certainly die because we have seen God.” 23 But his wife said to him, “If Yahweh wanted to kill us he would not have taken from our hand the burnt offering and the grain offering, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us things such as these.” 24 The woman bore a son, and she called him Samson; the boy grew big, and Yahweh blessed him. 25 And the Spirit of Yahweh began to stir him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.

Joshua,"1 And it happened, after a long time, after Yahweh had given rest to Israel from all their surrounding enemies, and after Joshua was old and well-advanced in years, 2 Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders, heads, judges, and officials, and he said to them, “I am old and well-advanced in years, 3 and you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations for your sake, for Yahweh your God is fighting for you. 4 Look! I have allotted to you these remaining nations as an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, to the Great Sea in the west. 5 And Yahweh your God will push them back before you and drive them out of your sight, and you will possess their land, just as Yahweh your God promised to you. 6 Be very strong to observe carefully all that is written in the scroll of the law of Moses so as not to turn aside from it, to the right or left, 7 so as not to go among these remaining nations with you; do not profess the name of their gods, and do not swear by them, serve them, or bow down to them. 8 But hold fast to Yahweh your God, just as you have done up to this day. 9 Yahweh has driven out before you great and strong nations; and as for you, nobody has withstood you to this day. 10 One of your men put to flight a thousand, for Yahweh your God is fighting for you, just as he promised you. 11 Take utmost care for the sake of your life to love Yahweh your God, 12 for if indeed you turn back and join these remaining nations among you, and you intermarry with them, marrying their women and they yours, 13 know for certain that Yahweh your God will not continue to drive out these nations from before you; they will be for you a snare and a trap, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that Yahweh your God has given to you. 14 Look! I am about to die, and you know in all your hearts and souls that not one thing failed from all the good things that Yahweh your God promised concerning you; everything has been fulfilled; not one thing failed. 15 But just as all the good things came to you that Yahweh your God promised, so will Yahweh bring to you all the bad things until he has destroyed you from this good land that Yahweh your God has given to you. 16 If you transgress the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he commanded to you, and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, Yahweh’s anger will be kindled against you, and you will perish quickly from the good land that he has given to you.” 1 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem; he summoned the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officials, and they presented themselves before God. 2 And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: ‘Long ago your ancestors—Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor—lived beyond the river, and they served other gods. 3 I took your ancestor Abraham from beyond the river and led him through all the land of Canaan, and I increased his offspring; I gave him Isaac, 4 and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. 5 And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out. 6 When I brought out your ancestors from Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your ancestors with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. 7 They cried out to Yahweh, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea over them and covered them; your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you lived in the wilderness for many days. 8 And I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan; they fought you, and I gave them into your hand; you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you. 9 Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, set out and fought against Israel, and he sent and summoned Balaam son of Beor to curse you, 10 but I was not willing to listen to Balaam, and he richly blessed you. So I rescued you from his hand, 11 and you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the citizens of Jericho, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, fought against you, and I gave them into your hand. 12 I sent before you the hornet and they drove out before you two kings of the Amorites; but not by your sword or bow. 13 I gave to you a land that you have not labored on, and cities that you have not built, and you live in them; you eat from vineyards and olive groves that you have not planted.’ 14 “So now, revere Yahweh and serve him in sincerity and faithfulness; remove the gods that your ancestors served beyond the river and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh. 15 But if it is bad in your eyes to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves today whom you want to serve, whether it is the gods that your ancestors served beyond the river, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve Yahweh.” 16 And the people answered and said, “Far be it from us that we would forsake Yahweh to serve other gods, 17 for Yahweh our God brought us and our ancestors from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, and did these great signs before our eyes. He protected us along the entire way that we went, and among all the peoples through whose midst we passed. 18 And Yahweh drove out all the people before us, the Amorites who live in the land. We will serve Yahweh, for he is our God.” 19 But Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve Yahweh, for he is a holy and jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins. 20 If you forsake Yahweh and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster to you; he will destroy you after he has done good to you.” 21 And the people said to Joshua, “No, we will serve Yahweh.” 22 And Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves to serve Yahweh.” And they said, “We are witnesses.” 23 He said, “Remove the foreign gods that are in your midst, and incline your hearts to Yahweh the God of Israel.” 24 And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his voice.” 25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and he established for them a statute and a judgment at Shechem. 26 Then Joshua wrote these words in a scroll of the law of God, and he took a large stone and set it up there under a large tree, which is at the shrine of Yahweh. 27 And Joshua said to all the people, “Look, this stone will be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of Yahweh that he spoke with us. It will be as a witness against you, so that you do not deny your God.” 28 Then Joshua sent the people away to their inheritance. 29 After these things Joshua son of Nun servant of Yahweh died; he was one hundred and ten years old. 30 They buried him in the territory of his inheritance, at Timnath-Serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 31 Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who lived long after Joshua, and who had known all the work that Yahweh did for Israel. 32 The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought out from Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in a piece of land that Jacob had bought from the children of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred pieces of money; it became an inheritance for the descendants of Joseph. 33 And Eleazar son of Aaron died; and they buried him in Gibeah in the hill country of Ephraim, which had been given to his son Phinehas.

Joshua,"1 Then the heads of the families of the Levites came to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the families of the tribes of the Israelites. 2 And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “Yahweh commanded through the hand of Moses to give us cities to live in, with their pasturelands for our livestock.” 3 So, by command of Yahweh, the Israelites gave the Levites these cities and their pasturelands from their inheritance. 4 The allotment fell for the families of the Kohathites. The descendants of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, received by lot thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. 5 The remaining descendants of Kohath received by lot ten cities from the families of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 6 The descendants of Gershon received by lot thirteen cities from the families of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, and Naphtali and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan. 7 The descendants of the Merarites according to their families received twelve cities from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun. 8 The Israelites gave to the Levites these cities and their pastureland by lot, just as Yahweh commanded through the hand of Moses. 9 They gave these cities, which are here mentioned by name, from the tribe of the families of Judah and from the tribe of the families of Simeon; 10 and they were for the descendants of Aaron, from the families of the Kohathites, from the descendants of Levi, because the first lot was theirs. 11 And they gave to them Kiriath Arba, Arba being the father of Anak (that is, Hebron), in the hill country of Judah and the pasturelands surrounding it. 12 But the field of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his property. 13 To the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for the killer, and its pasturelands, Libnah and its pasturelands, 14 Jattir and its pasturelands, Eshtemoa and its pasturelands, 15 Holon and its pasturelands, Debir and its pasturelands, 16 Ain and its pasturelands, Juttah and its pasturelands, and Beth Shemesh and its pasturelands; nine cities from these two tribes. 17 From the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon and its pasturelands, Geba and its pasturelands, 18 Anathoth and its pasturelands, Almon and its pasturelands; four cities. 19 All the cities of the descendants of Aaron the priests, thirteen cities and their pasturelands. 20 For the families of the descendants of Kohath, the remaining Levites of the descendants of Kohath, they received the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephraim. 21 They gave them Shechem, the city of refuge for the killer, and its pasturelands in the hill country of Ephraim, Gezer and its pasturelands, 22 Kibzaim and its pasturelands, and Beth-horon and its pasturelands; four cities. 23 From the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh and its pasturelands, Gibbethon and its pasturelands, 24 Aijalon and its pasturelands, and Gath Rimmon and its pasturelands; four cities. 25 From the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach and its pasturelands and Gath Rimmon with its pasturelands; two cities. 26 All the cities and their pasturelands for the remaining families of the descendants of Kohath were ten. 27 To the descendants of Gershon, one of the families of the Levites, from the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan, a city of refuge for the killer, and its pasturelands, and Eshtarah and its pasturelands; two cities. 28 From the tribe of Issachar, Kishion and its pasturelands, Daberath and its pasturelands, 29 Jarmuth and its pasturelands, En Gannim and its pasturelands; four cities. 30 From the tribe of Asher, Mishal and its pasturelands, Abdon and its pasturelands, 31 Helkath and its pasturelands, Rehob and its pasturelands; four cities. 32 From the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee, the city of refuge for the killer, and its pasturelands, Hammoth Dor and its pasturelands, and Kartan and its pasturelands; three cities. 33 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities and their pasturelands. 34 To the families of the descendants of Merarite, the remaining Levites, from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam and its pasturelands, Kartah and its pasturelands, 35 Dimnah and its pasturelands, and Nahalal and its pasturelands; four cities. 36 From the tribe of Reuben, Bezer and its pasturelands, Jahaz and its pasturelands, 37 Kedemoth and its pasturelands, and Mephaath and its pasturelands; four cities. 38 From the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead, the city of refuge for the killer, and its pasturelands, Mahanaim and its pasturelands, 39 Heshbon and its pasturelands, and Jazer and its pasturelands; four cities in all. 40 All these were the cities of the descendants of Merarite according to their families, the remaining families of the Levites; their allotment was twelve cities. 41 All the cities of the Levites among the property of the Israelites were forty-eight cities and their pasturelands. 42 Each of these cities had pasturelands surrounding them; so it was for all of these cities. 43 And Yahweh gave to Israel all the land that he swore to give to their ancestors, and they took possession of it and settled in it. 44 Yahweh gave them rest on every side, according to all that he had sworn to their ancestors, and nobody from all their enemies withstood them, for Yahweh had given all their enemies into their hand. 45 And nothing failed from all the good things that Yahweh promised to the house of Israel; everything came to pass. 1 Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 2 and he said to them, “You have observed all that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, and you have listened to my voice in all that I have commanded you; 3 you have not forsaken your kinsmen these many days, up to this day, and you have observed the obligation of the command of Yahweh your God. 4 So then, Yahweh your God has given rest to your kinsmen, just as he promised them; so then, turn and go to your tents to the land of your possession, which Moses Yahweh’s servant gave to you beyond the Jordan. 5 Only be very careful to observe the commandment and law that Moses Yahweh’s servant commanded you, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.” 6 And Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents. 7 And to the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua had given a possession with their kinsmen beyond the Jordan to the west; and when Joshua sent them to their tents and blessed them, 8 he said to them, “Return to your tents with much wealth, and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, copper, iron, and with very much clothing; divide the war-booty of your enemies with your kinsmen.” 9 So the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home and departed with the Israelites at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead to the land of their possession, which they had acquired according to the command of Yahweh through the hand of Moses. 10 And they came to the region of the Jordan that is in the land of Canaan, and the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar on the Jordan, a large and imposing altar. 11 And the Israelites heard it said that the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had built an altar next to the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, on the side belonging to the Israelites. 12 When the Israelites heard of it, the whole congregation of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh to go up against them for battle. 13 And the Israelites sent to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, Phinehas the priest son of Eleazar, 14 and ten leaders with him, one leader for each family from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one was the head of his family among the clans of Israel. 15 They came to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying, 16 “Thus says all the congregation of Yahweh: ‘What is this treachery that you have committed against the God of Israel by turning away today from following Yahweh, by building for yourselves an altar to rebel today against Yahweh? 17 Is not the sin of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves today, and for which a plague came to the congregation of Yahweh, 18 that you must turn today from following Yahweh? If you rebel today against Yahweh, tomorrow he will be angry with all of the congregation of Israel; 19 if, however, the land of your property is unclean, cross over to the land of Yahweh’s property, where Yahweh’s tabernacle resides, and take possession among us. But you must not rebel against Yahweh or against us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of Yahweh our God. 20 Did not Achan son of Zerah commit treachery with devoted things, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? And he alone did not perish because of his iniquity.’ ” 21 And the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh spoke with the heads of the clans of Israel, 22 “Yahweh, God of gods! Yahweh, God of gods knows. And let Israel itself know, if it was in rebellion or treachery against Yahweh, do not spare us this day 23 for building for ourselves an altar to turn away from Yahweh, or if it was to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings, or fellowship offerings on it, may Yahweh himself take vengeance. 24 But in fact, we have done this because of anxiety, because of a reason, saying, ‘In the future your children may say to our children, ‘What is the relationship between you and Yahweh the God of Israel? 25 Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, the descendants of Reuben and Gad; you have no portion in Yahweh.’ So your children may put an end to our children worshiping Yahweh. 26 So we said, ‘Let us build immediately for ourselves an altar, not for burnt offerings or for sacrifices; 27 instead, it is a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us for performing the serving of Yahweh in his presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings; so that your children may not say in the future to our children, “You have no portion in Yahweh.” ’ 28 And we thought, if they say to us and to our children in the future, we can say, ‘Look at this replica of the altar of Yahweh, which our ancestors made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices; rather, it is a witness between us and you.’ 29 Far be it from us to rebel against Yahweh, to turn today from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices, instead of the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle.” 30 Phinehas the priest, the leaders of the congregation, and the heads of the clans of Israel who were with him heard the words that the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh spoke, and they were satisfied. 31 Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar, said to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, “Today we know that Yahweh is among us, because you have not committed this treachery against Yahweh. Therefore you have rescued the Israelites from the hand of Yahweh.” 32 And Phinehas the priest, son of Eleazar, and the leaders returned from the descendants of Reuben and Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan to the Israelites, and they gave them their report. 33 The report satisfied the Israelites; they blessed God, and they did not speak of going up for battle against them to destroy the land in which the descendants of Reuben and Gad were living. 34 The descendants of Reuben and Gad called the altar Witness, “Because,” they said, “it is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.” ",Joshua 21 - 22,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/joshua-21-22-4409/direct-download/tbd20070607.mp3
Joshua,"1 The second allotment fell for Simeon, for the tribe of the descendants of Simeon, according to their families. And their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the descendants of Judah. 2 And they had as their inheritance Beersheba, Sheba, Moladah, 3 Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem, 4 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 5 Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah, 6 Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages. 7 Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages, 8 and all the villages that were around these towns up to Baalat-Beor, Ramath of the Negev. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Simeon according to their families. 9 Part of the portion allotted to the descendants of Judah became the inheritance of the descendants of Simeon because the portion for the descendants of Judah was too large for them, so the descendants of Simeon inherited from their inheritance. 10 The third allotment came up for the descendants of Zebulun according to their families. The border of their inheritance went up to Sarid. 11 Their border goes up to the west, to Maralah; it touches Dabbesheth, then the wadi that is opposite Jokneam. 12 It turns from Sarid to the east to the sunrise, to the border of Kislot-Tabor; it continues to Daberath and goes up to Japhia. 13 From there it passes along to the east toward the sunrise, to Gath Hepher and to Eth Kazin, and continuing to Rimmon, it turns to Neah; 14 it changes direction from the north of Hannathon, and it ends at the valley of Yiptah-El; 15 Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem; twelve cities and their villages. 16 This is the inheritance of the descendants of Zebulun according to their families, these cities and their villages. 17 The fourth allotment fell for Issachar, for the descendants of Issachar, according to their families. 18 Their border went to Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, 19 Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 20 Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 21 Remeth, En Gannim, En Haddah, and Beth Pazzez; 22 and the border touches Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh. Its border ends at the Jordan; sixteen cities and their villages. 23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages. 24 The fifth allotment fell for the tribe of the descendants of Asher according to their families. 25 Their border was Helkath, Hali, Beten, Acshaph, 26 Allamelech, Amad, and Mishal; it touches Carmel to the west, and Shihor-Libnat. 27 Then it turns eastward to Beth-dagon and touches Zebulun and the valley of Yiptah-El to the north to Beth Emeck and Neiel; it continues to Cabul from the north, 28 and Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah up to Great Sidon; 29 then the border turns to Ramah, and up to the fortified city of Tyre, where the border turns to Hosah; it ends at the sea, from Hebel to Aczib. 30 Included were Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob; twenty-two cities and their villages. 31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Asher according to their families, these cities and their villages. 32 The sixth allotment fell for the children of Naphtali, for the children of Naphtali according to their families. 33 Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, Adami Nekeb, Jabneel, up to Lakkum; it ends at the Jordan; 34 then the border turns to the west, to Aznoth Tabor, and continues from there to Hukok, and it touches Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and Judah on the east at the Jordan. 35 The fortified cities are Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth, 36 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 37 Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor, 38 Yiron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth-anath, Beth Shemesh; nineteen cities and their villages. 39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages. 40 The seventh lot fell for the tribe of the descendants of Dan according to their families. 41 The border of their inheritance was Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir Shemesh, 42 Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 43 Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 45 Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon, 46 Me Jarkon, Rakkon, with the border opposite Joppa. 47 The border of the descendants of Dan continued beyond them, because the descendants of Dan went up and fought with Lesham, and they captured and struck it with the edge of the sword, and they took possession of it and settled in it; and they called Leshem Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor. 48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Dan according to their families, these cities and their villages. 49 They finished assigning the land according to its borders, and the Israelites gave an inheritance from among them to Joshua son of Nun. 50 According to the commandment of Yahweh, they gave him the city that he requested, Timnath Serah, in the hill country of Ephraim, and he rebuilt the city and settled in it. 51 These are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families of the tribes, distributed by allotment to the Israelites, at Shiloh before Yahweh at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And they finished dividing the land. 1 And Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying, 2 “Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘Appoint for yourselves cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through the hand of Moses. 3 Anyone who kills a person by accident or unintentionally may flee there; they will be for yourselves a refuge from the avenger of blood. 4 The killer will flee to one of these cities, stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and state his case to the elders of that city; and they will take him into the city and give him a place, and he will dwell among them. 5 And if the avenger of blood pursues after him, they will not hand over the killer into his hand, because he killed his neighbor unintentionally, and he did not hate him previously. 6 The killer will stay in that city until he stands before the congregation for the trial, until the death of the one who is the high priest in those days. Then the killer will return to his city and to his house, to the city from which he fled.’ ” 7 So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 8 Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau, from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in the Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh. 9 These were the cities designated for all the Israelites, and for the foreigners dwelling among them, for anyone that kills a person unintentionally to flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until there is a trial before the congregation.

Acts,"26 And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was added to serve with the eleven apostles. 1 And when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in the same place. 2 And suddenly a sound like a violent rushing wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. 3 And divided tongues like fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages as the Spirit gave them ability to speak out. 5 Now there were Jews residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven. 6 And when this sound occurred, the crowd gathered and was in confusion, because each one was hearing them speaking in his own language. 7 And they were astounded and astonished, saying, “Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans? 8 And how do we hear, each one of us, in our own native language? 9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those residing in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya toward Cyrene, and the Romans who were in town, 11 both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs—we hear them speaking in our own languages the great deeds of God!” 12 And all were amazed and greatly perplexed, saying to one another, “What can this mean?” 13 But others jeered and said, “They are full of sweet new wine!” ",Acts 1:26-2:13,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/acts-126213-287633/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-07-09_acts-126213_20120620195201.mp3
Acts,"14 But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them, “Judean men, and all those who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and pay attention to my words! 15 For these men are not drunk, as you assume, because it is the third hour of the day. 16 But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel: 17 ‘And it will be in the last days,’ God says, ‘I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams. 18 And even on my male slaves and on my female slaves I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. 19 And I will cause wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke. 20 The sun will be changed to darkness and the moon to blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes. 21 And it will be that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.’ 22 “Israelite men, listen to these words! Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know—23 this man, delivered up by the determined plan and foreknowledge of God, you executed by nailing to a cross through the hand of lawless men. 24 God raised him up, having brought to an end the pains of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. 25 For David says with reference to him, ‘I saw the Lord before me continually, for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken. 26 For this reason my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced greatly, furthermore also my flesh will live in hope, 27 because you will not abandon my soul in Hades, nor will you permit your Holy One to experience decay. 28 You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with gladness with your presence.’ 29 “Men and brothers, it is possible to speak with confidence to you about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us until this day. 30 Therefore, because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat one of his descendants on his throne, 31 by having foreseen this, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he abandoned in Hades nor did his flesh experience decay. 32 This Jesus God raised up, of which we all are witnesses. 33 Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out this that you see and hear. 34 For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, 35 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.” ’ 36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know beyond a doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified!” 37 Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “What should we do, men and brothers?” 38 And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all those who are far away, as many as the Lord our God calls to himself.” 40 And with many other words he solemnly urged and exhorted them, saying, “Be saved from this crooked generation!” 41 So those who accepted his message were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added. 42 And they were devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayers. 43 And fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were being performed by the apostles. 44 And all who believed were in the same place, and had everything in common. 45 And they began selling their possessions and property, and distributing these things to all, to the degree that anyone had need. 46 And every day, devoting themselves to meeting with one purpose in the temple courts and breaking bread from house to house, they were eating their food with joy and simplicity of heart, 47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding every day to the total of those who were being saved.

Acts,"27 And he got up and went, and behold, there was a man, an Ethiopian eunuch (a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasury) who had come to worship in Jerusalem 28 and was returning and sitting in his chariot, and reading aloud the prophet Isaiah. 29 And the Spirit said to Philip, “Approach and join this chariot.” 30 So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading aloud Isaiah the prophet and said, “So then, do you understand what you are reading?” 31 And he said, “So how could I, unless someone will guide me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 32 Now the passage of scripture that he was reading aloud was this: “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth. 33 In his humiliation justice was taken from him. Who can describe his descendants? For his life was taken away from the earth.” 34 And the eunuch answered and said to Philip, “I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this—about himself or about someone else?” 35 So Philip opened his mouth and beginning from this scripture, proclaimed the good news to him about Jesus. 36 And as they were traveling down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?” 38 And he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water—Philip and the eunuch—and he baptized him. 39 And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him any longer, for he went on his way rejoicing. 40 But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea. 1 But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest 2 and asked for letters from him to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, both men and women, he could bring them tied up to Jerusalem. 3 Now as he proceeded, it happened that when he approached Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. 4 And falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” 5 So he said, “Who are you, Lord?” And he said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting! 6 But get up and enter into the city, and it will be told to you what you must do.” 7 (Now the men who were traveling together with him stood speechless, because they heard the voice but saw no one.) 8 So Saul got up from the ground, but although his eyes were open he could see nothing. And leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus. 9 And he was unable to see for three days, and he did not eat or drink. 10 Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias!” And he said, “Behold, here I am, Lord!” 11 And the Lord said to him, “Get up, go to the street called ‘Straight’ and in the house of Judas look for a man named Saul from Tarsus. For behold, he is praying, 12 and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and placing hands on him so that he may regain his sight.” ",Acts 8:27-9:12,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/acts-827912-287646/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-07-19_acts-827912_20120620224102.mp3
Acts,"39 So Peter got up and accompanied them. When he arrived, they brought him up to the upstairs room, and all the widows came to him, weeping and showing him tunics and other clothing that Dorcas used to make while she was with them. 40 But Peter sent them all outside, and, falling to his knees, he prayed. And turning toward the body, he said, “Tabitha, get up!” And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 41 And he gave her his hand and raised her up. And he called the saints and the widows and presented her alive. 42 And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. 43 And it happened that he stayed many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner. 1 Now there was a certain man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Cohort, 2 devout and fearing God together with all his household, doing many charitable deeds for the people and praying to God continually. 3 About the ninth hour of the day, he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, “Cornelius.” 4 And he stared at him and became terrified and said, “What is it, Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your charitable deeds have gone up for a memorial offering before God. 5 And now, send men to Joppa and summon a certain Simon, who is also called Peter. 6 This man is staying as a guest with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.” 7 And when the angel who spoke to him departed, he summoned two of the household slaves and a devout soldier from those who attended him, 8 and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa. 9 And the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about the sixth hour. 10 And he became hungry and wanted to eat. But while they were preparing the food, a trance came over him. 11 And he saw heaven opened and an object something like a large sheet coming down, being let down to the earth by its four corners, 12 in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the sky. 13 And a voice came to him, “Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!” 14 But Peter said, “Certainly not, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common and unclean!” 15 And the voice came again to him for the second time: “The things which God has made clean, you must not consider unclean!” 16 And this happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into heaven. 17 Now while Peter was greatly perplexed within himself as to what the vision that he had seen might be, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having found the house of Simon by asking around, stood at the gate. 18 And they called out and asked if Simon who was also called Peter was staying there as a guest. 19 And while Peter was reflecting about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, men are looking for you. 20 But get up, go down, and go with them—not hesitating at all, because I have sent them.” 21 So Peter went down to the men and said, “Behold, I am he whom you are looking for! What is the reason for which you have come?” 22 And they said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man—and well spoken of by the whole nation of the Jews—was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear words from you.” 23 So he invited them in and entertained them as guests, and on the next day he got up and went away with them. And some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him. 24 And on the next day he entered into Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends. 25 So it happened that when Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him. 26 But Peter helped him up, saying, “Get up! I myself am also a man!” 27 And as he conversed with him, he went in and found many people gathered. 28 And he said to them, “You know that it is forbidden for a Jewish man to associate with or to approach a foreigner. And to me God has shown that I should call no man common or unclean.

Acts,"29 Therefore—and without raising any objection—I came when I was sent for. So I ask for what reason you sent for me.” 30 And Cornelius said, “Four days ago at this hour, the ninth, I was praying in my house. And behold, a man in shining clothing stood before me 31 and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your charitable deeds have been remembered before God. 32 Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon who is also called Peter. This man is staying as a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. 33 Therefore I sent for you at once, and you were kind enough to come. So now we all are present before God to hear all the things that have been commanded to you by the Lord.” 34 So Peter opened his mouth and said, “In truth I understand that God is not one who shows partiality, 35 but in every nation the one who fears him and who does what is right is acceptable to him. 36 As for the message that he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ—this one is Lord of all—37 you know the thing that happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism that John proclaimed: 38 Jesus of Nazareth—how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him. 39 And we are witnesses of all the things that he did both in the land of the Judeans and in Jerusalem, whom they also executed by hanging him on a tree. 40 God raised this one up on the third day and granted that he should become visible, 41 not to all the people but to us who had been chosen beforehand by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 42 And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify solemnly that this one is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and of the dead. 43 To this one all the prophets testify, that through his name everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins.” 44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who were listening to the message. 45 And those believers from the circumcision who had accompanied Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles, 46 for they heard them speaking in tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter said, 47 “Surely no one can withhold the water for these people to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did!” 48 So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days. 1 Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had accepted the word of God. 2 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision took issue with him, 3 saying, “You went to men who were uncircumcised and ate with them!” 4 But Peter began and explained it to them in an orderly sequence, saying, 5 “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision—an object something like a large sheet coming down, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came to me. 6 As I looked intently into it, I was considering it, and I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild animals and the reptiles and the birds of the sky. 7 And I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!’ 8 But I said, ‘Certainly not, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has ever entered into my mouth!’ 9 But the voice replied from heaven for the second time, ‘The things which God has made clean, you must not consider unclean!’ 10 And this happened three times, and everything was pulled up into heaven again. 11 And behold, at once three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea approached the house in which we were staying. 12 And the Spirit told me to accompany them, not hesitating at all. So these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the man’s house. 13 And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is also called Peter, 14 who will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.’ 15 And as I was beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as also on us at the beginning. 16 And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ 17 Therefore if God gave them the same gift as also to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to hinder God?” 18 And when they heard these things, they became silent and praised God, saying, “Then God has granted the repentance leading to life to the Gentiles also!” 19 Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, proclaiming the message to no one except Jews alone. 20 But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they came to Antioch, began to speak to the Hellenists also, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus. 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord. 22 And the report came to the attention of the church that was in Jerusalem about them, and they sent out Barnabas as far as Antioch, 23 who, when he arrived and saw the grace of God, rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with devoted hearts, 24 because he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a large number were added to the Lord. 25 So he departed for Tarsus to look for Saul. 26 And when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it happened to them also that they met together for a whole year with the church and taught a large number of people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians. 27 Now in those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 28 And one of them named Agabus stood up and indicated by the Spirit that a great famine was about to come over the whole inhabited earth (which took place in the time of Claudius). 29 So from the disciples, according to their ability to give, each one of them determined to send financial aid for support to the brothers who lived in Judea, 30 which they also did, sending the aid to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.

Acts,"1 And some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom prescribed by Moses, you cannot be saved.” 2 And after there was no little strife and debate by Paul and Barnabas against them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas and some others from among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this issue. 3 So they were sent on their way by the church, and passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, telling in detail the conversion of the Gentiles and bringing great joy to all the brothers. 4 And when they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and reported all that God had done with them. 5 But some of those who had believed from the party of the Pharisees stood up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to observe the law of Moses!” 6 Both the apostles and the elders assembled to deliberate concerning this matter. 7 And after there was much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Men and brothers, you know that in the early days God chose among you through my mouth that the Gentiles should hear the message of the gospel and believe. 8 And God, who knows the heart, testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he also did to us. 9 And he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. 10 So now why are you putting God to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? 11 But we believe we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus in the same way those also are.” 12 And the whole group became silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul describing all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. 13 And after they had stopped speaking, James answered, saying, “Men and brothers, listen to me!

Acts,"12 And the whole group became silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul describing all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. 13 And after they had stopped speaking, James answered, saying, “Men and brothers, listen to me! 14 Simeon has described how God first concerned himself to take from among the Gentiles a people for his name. 15 And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written: 16 ‘After these things I will return and build up again the tent of David that has fallen, and the parts of it that had been torn down I will build up again and will restore it, 17 so that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things 18 known from of old.’ 19 Therefore I conclude we should not cause difficulty for those from among the Gentiles who turn to God, 20 but we should write a letter to them to abstain from the pollution of idols and from sexual immorality and from what has been strangled and from blood. 21 For Moses has those who proclaim him in every city from ancient generations, because he is read aloud in the synagogues on every Sabbath.” 22 Then it seemed best to the apostles and the elders, together with the whole church, to send men chosen from among them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas—Judas who was called Barsabbas and Silas, men who were leaders among the brothers—23 writing this letter to be delivered by them: The apostles and the elders, brothers. To the brothers who are from among the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia. Greetings! 24 Because we have heard that some have gone out from among us—to whom we gave no orders—and have thrown you into confusion by words upsetting your minds, 25 it seemed best to us, having reached a unanimous decision, and having chosen men, to send them to you together with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul, 26 men who have risked their lives on behalf of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 27 Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, and they will report the same things by word of mouth. 28 For it seemed best to the Holy Spirit and to us to place on you no greater burden except these necessary things: 29 that you abstain from food sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these things you will do well. Farewell. 30 So when they were sent off, they came down to Antioch, and after calling together the community, they delivered the letter. 31 And when they read it aloud, they rejoiced at the encouragement. 32 Both Judas and Silas, who were also prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brothers by a long message. 33 And after spending some time, they were sent away in peace from the brothers to those who had sent them. 35 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord with many others also. 36 And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, “Come then,let us return and visit the brothers in every town in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing.” 37 Now Barnabas wanted to take John who was called Mark along also, 38 but Paul held the opinion they should not take this one along, who departed from them in Pamphylia and did not accompany them in the work. 39 And a sharp disagreement took place, so that they separated from one another. And Barnabas took along Mark and sailed away to Cyprus, 40 but Paul chose Silas and departed, after being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers. 41 And he traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.

Acts,"40 but Paul chose Silas and departed, after being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers. 41 And he traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches. 1 And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple was there named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewish woman but of a Greek father, 2 who was well spoken of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium. 3 Paul wanted this one to go with him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was Greek. 4 And as they went through the towns, they passed on to them to observe the rules that had been decided by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem. 5 So the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were growing in number every day. 6 And they traveled through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the message in Asia. 7 And when they came to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them. 8 So going through Mysia, they went down to Troas. 9 And a vision appeared to Paul during the night: a certain Macedonian man was standing there and imploring him and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!” 10 And when he had seen the vision, we wanted at once to go away to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them. 11 So putting out to sea from Troas, we sailed a straight course to Samothrace, and on the following day to Neapolis, 12 and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of that district of Macedonia, a Roman colony. And we were staying in this city for some days. 13 And on the day of the Sabbath, we went outside the city gate beside the river, where we thought there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women assembled there. 14 And a certain woman named Lydia from the city of Thyatira, a merchant dealing in purple cloth who showed reverence for God, was listening. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was being said by Paul. 15 And after she was baptized, and her household, she urged us, saying, “If you consider me to be a believer in the Lord, come to my house and stay.” And she prevailed upon us. 16 And it happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain female slave who had a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing a large profit to her owners by fortune-telling. 17 She followed Paul and us and was crying out, saying, “These men are slaves of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation!” 18 And she was doing this for many days. But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed and turning around, said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out immediately. 19 But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers. 20 And when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, “These men are throwing our city into confusion, being Jews, 21 and are proclaiming customs that are not permitted for us to accept or to practice, because we are Romans!” 22 And the crowd joined in attacking them, and the chief magistrates tore off their clothing and gave orders to beat them with rods. 23 And after they had inflicted many blows on them, they threw them into prison, giving orders to the jailer to guard them securely. 24 Having received such an order, he put them in the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. 25 Now about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. 26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and all the bonds were unfastened. 27 And after the jailer was awake and saw the doors of the prison open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, because he thought the prisoners had escaped. 28 But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, “Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here!” 29 And demanding lights, he rushed in and, beginning to tremble, fell down at the feet of Paul and Silas. 30 And he brought them outside and said, “Sirs, what must I do so that I can be saved?” 31 And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household!” 32 And they spoke the message of the Lord to him, together with all those in his house. 33 And he took them at that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and he himself was baptized at once, and all those of his household. 34 And he brought them up into his house and set a meal before them, and rejoiced greatly that he had believed in God with his whole household. 35 And when it was day, the chief magistrates sent the police officers, saying, “Release those men.” 36 And the jailer reported these words to Paul: “The chief magistrates have sent an order that you should be released. So come out now and go in peace!” 37 But Paul said to them, “They beat us in public without due process—men who are Roman citizens—and threw us into prison, and now they are wanting to release us secretly? Certainly not! Rather let them come themselves and bring us out!” 38 So the police officers reported these words to the chief magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens. 39 And they came and apologized to them, and after they brought them out they asked them to depart from the city. 40 And when they came out of the prison, they went to Lydia and when they saw them, they encouraged the brothers and departed.

Acts,"1 Now after they traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. 2 And as was his custom, Paul went in to them and on three Sabbath days he discussed with them from the scriptures, 3 explaining and demonstrating that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, “This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ.” 4 And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, and also a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few of the prominent women. 5 But the Jews were filled with jealousy and, taking along some worthless men from the rabble in the marketplace and forming a mob, threw the city into an uproar. And attacking Jason’s house, they were looking for them to bring them out to the popular assembly. 6 And when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brothers before the city officials, shouting, “These people who have stirred up trouble throughout the world have come here also, 7 whom Jason has entertained as guests! And these people are all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus!” 8 And they threw the crowd into confusion, and the city officials who heard these things. 9 And after taking money as security from Jason and the rest, they released them. 10 Now the brothers sent away both Paul and Silas at once, during the night, to Berea. They went into the synagogue of the Jews when they arrived. 11 Now these were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica. They accepted the message with all eagerness, examining the scriptures every day to see if these things were so. 12 Therefore many of them believed, and not a few of the prominent Greek women and men. 13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica found out that the message of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there too, inciting and stirring up the crowds. 14 So then the brothers sent Paul away at once to go to the sea, and both Silas and Timothy remained there. 15 And those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving an order for Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as soon as possible, they went away. 16 Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he observed the city was full of idols. 17 So he was discussing in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there. 18 And even some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him, and some were saying, “What does this babbler want to say?” But others said, “He appears to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,” because he was proclaiming the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. 19 And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we learn what is this new teaching being proclaimed by you? 20 For you are bringing some astonishing things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.” 21 (Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who stayed there used to spend their time in nothing else than telling something or listening to something new.)

Acts,"22 So Paul stood there in the middle of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see you are very religious in every respect. 23 For as I was passing through and observing carefully your objects of worship, I even found an altar on which was inscribed, ‘To an unknown God.’ Therefore what you worship without knowing it, this I proclaim to you—24 the God who made the world and all the things in it. This one, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by human hands, 25 nor is he served by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives to everyone life and breath and everything. 26 And he made from one man every nation of humanity to live on all the face of the earth, determining their fixed times and the fixed boundaries of their habitation, 27 to search for God, if perhaps indeed they might feel around for him and find him. And indeed he is not far away from each one of us, 28 for in him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said: ‘For we also are his offspring.’ 29 Therefore, because we are offspring of God, we ought not to think the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by human skill and thought. 30 Therefore although God has overlooked the times of ignorance, he now commands all people everywhere to repent, 31 because he has set a day on which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man who he has appointed, having provided proof to everyone by raising him from the dead.” 32 Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some scoffed, but others said, “We will hear you about this again also.” 33 So Paul went out from the midst of them. 34 But some people joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them. 1 After these things he departed from Athens and went to Corinth. 2 And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus who had arrived recently from Italy along with Priscilla his wife, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome, and he went to them. 3 And because he was practicing the same trade, he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade. 4 And he argued in the synagogue every Sabbath, attempting to persuade both Jews and Greeks. 5 Now when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul began to be occupied with the message, solemnly testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus. 6 And when they resisted and reviled him, he shook out his clothes and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am guiltless! From now on I will go to the Gentiles!” 7 And leaving there, he entered into the house of someone named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God whose house was next door to the synagogue. 8 And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his whole household. And many of the Corinthians, when they heard about it, believed and were baptized.

Acts,"9 And the Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night, “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not keep silent, 10 because I am with you and no one will attack you to harm you, because many people are mine in this city.” 11 So he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. 12 Now when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up with one purpose against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat, 13 saying, “This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law!” 14 But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it was some crime or wicked villainy, O Jews, I would have been justified in accepting your complaint. 15 But if it is questions concerning a word and names and your own law, see to it yourselves! I do not wish to be a judge of these things.” 16 And he drove them away from the judgment seat. 17 So they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and began beating him in front of the judgment seat. And none of these things was a concern to Gallio. 18 So Paul, after remaining many days longer, said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head at Cenchrea, because he had taken a vow.19 So they arrived at Ephesus, and those he left behind there, but he himself entered into the synagogue and discussed with the Jews. 20 And when they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not give his consent, 21 but saying farewell and telling them, “I will return to you again if God wills,” he set sail from Ephesus. 22 And when he arrived at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch. 23 And after spending some time there, he departed, traveling through one place after another in the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples. 24 Now a certain Jew named Apollos, a native Alexandrian, arrived in Ephesus—an eloquent man who was well-versed in the scriptures. 25 This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and being enthusiastic in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things about Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John. 26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the way of God to him more accurately. 27 And when he wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he assisted greatly those who had believed through grace. 28 For he was vigorously refuting the Jews in public, demonstrating through the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus. 1 And it happened that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the inland regions and came to Ephesus and found some disciples. 2 And he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they said to him, “But we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit!” 3 And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” And they said, “Into the baptism of John.” 4 And Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people that they should believe in the one who was to come after him—that is, in Jesus.” 5 And when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 6 And when Paul laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy. 7 (Now the total number of men was about twelve.)

Acts,"2 And he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they said to him, “But we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit!” 3 And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” And they said, “Into the baptism of John.” 4 And Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people that they should believe in the one who was to come after him—that is, in Jesus.” 5 And when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 6 And when Paul laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy. 7 (Now the total number of men was about twelve.) 8 So he entered into the synagogue and was speaking boldly for three months, discussing and attempting to convince them concerning the kingdom of God. 9 But when some became hardened and were disobedient, reviling the Way before the congregation, he departed from them and took away the disciples, leading discussions every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. 10 And this took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks. 11 And God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, 12 so that even handkerchiefs or work aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to those who were sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them. 13 But some itinerant Jewish exorcists also attempted to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches!” 14 (Now seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.) 15 But the evil spirit answered and said to them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with, but who are you?” 16 And the man who had the evil spirit leaped on them, subdued all of them, and prevailed against them, so that they ran away from that house naked and wounded. 17 And this became known to all who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was exalted. 18 And many of those who had believed came, confessing and disclosing their practices, 19 and many of those who practiced magic brought together their books and burned them up in the sight of everyone. And they counted up their value and found it was fifty thousand silver coins. 20 In this way the word of the Lord was growing in power and was prevailing. 21 Now when these things were completed, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, “After I have been there, it is necessary for me to see Rome also.” 22 So after sending two of those who were assisting him, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, he himself stayed some time in Asia. 23 Now there happened at that time no little disturbance concerning the Way. 24 For someone named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver replicas of the temple of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen. 25 These he gathered together, and the workers occupied with such things, and said, “Men, you know that from this business we get our prosperity, 26 and you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this man Paul has persuaded and turned away a large crowd by saying that the gods made by hands are not gods. 27 So not only is there a danger this line of business of ours will come into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be regarded as nothing—and she is about to be brought down even from her grandeur, she whom the whole of Asia and the entire world worship!” 28 And when they heard this and became full of rage, they began to shout, saying, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 29 And the city was filled with the tumult, and with one purpose they rushed into the theater, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were traveling companions of Paul. 30 But when Paul wanted to enter into the popular assembly, the disciples would not let him. 31 And even some of the Asiarchs who were his friends sent word to him and were urging him not to risk himself by going into the theater. 32 So some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and the majority did not know why they had assembled. 33 And some of the crowd advised Alexander, when the Jews put him forward. But Alexander, motioning with his hand, was wanting to defend himself to the popular assembly. 34 But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they were shouting with one voice from all of them for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 35 And when the city secretary had quieted the crowd, he said, “Ephesian men, for who is there among men who does not know the Ephesian city is honorary temple keeper of the great Artemis and of her image fallen from heaven? 36 Therefore because these things are undeniable, it is necessary that you be quiet and do nothing rash! 37 For you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess. 38 If then Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against anyone, the court days are observed and there are proconsuls—let them bring charges against one another! 39 But if you desire anything further, it will be settled in the lawful assembly. 40 For indeed we are in danger of being accused of rioting concerning today, since there is no cause in relation to which we will be able to give an account concerning this disorderly gathering!” And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly. 1 Now after the turmoil had ceased, Paul summoned the disciples, and after encouraging them, he said farewell and departed to travel to Macedonia. 2 And after he had gone through those regions and encouraged them at length, he came to Greece 3 and stayed three months. Because a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he came to a decision to return through Macedonia. 4 And Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, and Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, and Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia, were accompanying him. 5 And these had gone on ahead and were waiting for us in Troas.

Acts,"6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread and came to them at Troas within five days, where we stayed seven days. 7 And on the first day of the week, when we had assembled to break bread, Paul began conversing with them, because he was going to leave on the next day, and he extended his message until midnight. 8 Now there were quite a few lamps in the upstairs room where we were gathered. 9 And a certain young man named Eutychus who was sitting in the window was sinking into a deep sleep while Paul was conversing at length. Being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead. 10 But Paul went down and threw himself on him, and putting his arms around him, said, “Do not be distressed, for his life is in him.” 11 So he went up and broke bread, and when he had eaten and talked for a long time, until dawn, then he departed. 12 And they led the youth away alive, and were greatly comforted. 13 But we went on ahead to the ship and put out to sea for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there. For having made arrangements in this way, he himself was intending to travel by land. 14 And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene. 15 And we sailed from there on the next day, and arrived opposite Chios. And on the next day we approached Samos, and on the following day we came to Miletus. 16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he would not be having to spend time in Asia. For he was hurrying if it could be possible for him to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. 17 And from Miletus he sent word to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the church. 18 And when they came to him, he said to them, “You know from the first day on which I set foot in Asia how I was the whole time with you—19 serving the Lord with all humility and with tears, and with the trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews—20 how I did not shrink from proclaiming to you anything that would be profitable, and from teaching you in public and from house to house, 21 testifying both to Jews and to Greeks with respect to repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus. 22 “And now behold, bound by the Spirit I am traveling to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there, 23 except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in town after town, saying that bonds and persecutions await me. 24 But I consider my life as worth nothing to myself, in order to finish my mission and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. 25 “And now behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more. 26 Therefore I testify to you on this very day that I am guiltless of the blood of all of you, 27 for I did not shrink from proclaiming to you the whole purpose of God. 28 Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock among which the Holy Spirit has appointed you as overseers, to shepherd the church of God which he obtained through the blood of his own Son. 29 I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. 30 And from among you yourselves men will arise, speaking perversions of the truth in order to draw away the disciples after them. 31 Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for three years I did not stop warning each one of you with tears. 32 “And now I entrust you to God and to the message of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. 33 I have desired no one’s silver or gold or clothing! 34 You yourselves know that these hands served to meet my needs and the needs of those who were with me. 35 I have shown you with respect to all things that by working hard in this way it is necessary to help those who are in need, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” 36 And when he had said these things, he fell to his knees and prayed with them all. 37 And there was considerable weeping by all, and hugging Paul, they kissed him, 38 especially distressed at the statement that he had said, that they were going to see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.

Acts,"1 And it happened that after we tore ourselves away from them, we put out to sea, and running a straight course we came to Cos and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. 2 And finding a ship that was crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and put out to sea. 3 And after we sighted Cyprus and left it behind on the port side, we sailed to Syria and arrived at Tyre, because the ship was to unload its cargo there. 4 And we stayed there seven days after we found the disciples, who kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem. 5 And it happened that when our days were over, we departed and went on our way, while all of them accompanied us, together with their wives and children, as far as outside the city. And after falling to our knees on the beach and praying, 6 we said farewell to one another and embarked in the ship, and they returned to their own homes. 7 And when we had completed the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. And after we greeted the brothers, we stayed one day with them. 8 And on the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him. 9 (Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.) 10 And while we were staying there many days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. 11 And he came to us and took Paul’s belt. Tying up his own feet and hands, he said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man whose belt this is, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’ ” 12 And when we heard these things, both we and the local residents urged him not to go up to Jerusalem. 13 Then Paul replied, “What are you doing weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be tied up, but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus!” 14 And because he would not be persuaded, we remained silent, saying, “The will of the Lord be done.” 15 So after these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem. 16 And some of the disciples from Caesarea also traveled together with us, bringing us to a certain Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple of long standing, with whom we were to be entertained as guests. 17 And when we came to Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly. 18 And on the next day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. 19 And after greeting them, he began to relate one after the other the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. 20 And when they heard this, they began to glorify God. And they said to him, “You see, brother, how many ten thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and they are all zealous adherents of the law. 21 And they have been informed about you that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles the abandonment of Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or to live according to our customs. 22 What then is to be done? Doubtless they will all hear that you have come! 23 Therefore do this that we tell you: we have four men who have taken a vow upon themselves. 24 Take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses so that they can shave their heads, and everyone will know that the things which they had been informed about you are nothing, but you yourself also agree with observing the law. 25 But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we have written a letter after deciding they should avoid food sacrificed to idols and blood and what has been strangled and sexual immorality.” ",Acts 21:1-25,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/acts-211-25-292183/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-08-09_acts-211-25_20120717125905.mp3
Acts,"26 Then Paul took along the men on the next day, and after he had purified himself together with them, he entered into the temple courts, announcing the completion of the days of purification until the time the offering would be presented on behalf of each one of them. 27 But when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia who had seen him in the temple courts stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him, 28 shouting, “Israelite men, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place! And furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!” 29 (For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they thought that Paul had brought into the temple.) 30 And the whole city was stirred up, and the people came running together, and they seized Paul and dragged him outside of the temple courts, and immediately the doors were shut. 31 And as they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the military tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion. 32 He immediately took along soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the military tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 33 Then the military tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what it was that he had done. 34 But some in the crowd were shouting one thing and others another, and because he was not able to find out the truth on account of the commotion, he gave orders to bring him into the barracks. 35 And when he came to the steps, it happened that he had to be carried by the soldiers on account of the violence of the crowd, 36 for the crowd of people was following them, shouting, “Away with him!” 37 And as he was about to be brought into the barracks, Paul said to the military tribune, “Is it permitted for me to say something to you?” And he said, “Do you know Greek? 38 Then you are not the Egyptian who before these days raised a revolt and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?” 39 But Paul said, “I am a Jewish man from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no unimportant city. Now I ask you, allow me to speak to the people.” 40 So when he permitted him, Paul, standing there on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he addressed them in the Aramaic language, saying, 1 “Men—brothers and fathers—listen to my defense to you now!” 2 And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Aramaic language, they became even more silent. And he said, 3 “I am a Jewish man born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, educated according to the exactness of the law received from our fathers, being zealous for God, just as all of you are today. 4 I persecuted this Way to the death, tying up and delivering to prison both men and women, 5 as indeed the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me, from whom also I received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and was traveling there to lead away those who were there also tied up to Jerusalem so that they could be punished. 6 “And it happened that as I was traveling and approaching Damascus around noon, suddenly a very bright light from heaven flashed around me, 7 and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’ 8 And I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene whom you are persecuting.’ 9 (Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.) 10 So I said, ‘What should I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and proceed to Damascus, and there it will be told to you about all the things that have been appointed for you to do.’ 11 And as I could not see as a result of the brightness of that light, I arrived in Damascus led by the hand of those who were with me. 12 And a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who live there, 13 came to me and stood by me and said to me, ‘Brother Saul, regain your sight!’ And at that same time I looked up at him and saw him. 14 And he said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth, 15 because you will be a witness for him to all people of what you have seen and heard. 16 And now why are you delaying? Get up, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name!’ 17 “And it happened that when I returned to Jerusalem and I was praying in the temple courts, I was in a trance, 18 and saw him saying to me, ‘Hurry and depart quickly from Jerusalem, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’ 19 And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that from synagogue to synagogue I was imprisoning and beating those who believed in you. 20 And when the blood of your witness Stephen was being shed, I myself also was standing near and was approving, and was guarding the cloaks of those who were killing him.’ 21 And he said to me, ‘Go, because I will send you far away to the Gentiles!’ ” 22 Now they were listening to him until this word, and they raised their voices, saying, “Away with such a man from the earth! For it is not fitting for him to live!” 23 And while they were screaming and throwing off their cloaks and throwing dust into the air, 24 the military tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying he was to be examined with a lash so that he could find out for what reason they were crying out against him in this way. 25 But when they had stretched him out for the lash, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it permitted for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?” 26 And when the centurion heard this, he went to the military tribune and reported it, saying, “What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen!” 27 So the military tribune came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” And he said, “Yes.” 28 And the military tribune replied, “I acquired this citizenship for a large sum of money.” And Paul said, “But I indeed was born a citizen. 29 Then immediately those who were about to examine him kept away from him, and the military tribune also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman citizen and that he had tied him up. 30 But on the next day, because he wanted to know the true reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin to assemble, and he brought down Paul and had him stand before them.

Acts,"1 And looking intently at the Sanhedrin, Paul said, “Men and brothers, I have lived my life in all good conscience before God to this day.” 2 So the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near him to strike his mouth. 3 Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! And are you sitting there judging me according to the law, and acting contrary to the law do you order me to be struck?” 4 And those who stood nearby said, “Are you reviling the high priest of God?” 5 And Paul said, “I did not know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, ‘You must not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’ ” 6 Now when Paul realized that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he shouted out in the Sanhedrin, “Men and brothers! I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees! I am being judged concerning the hope and the resurrection of the dead!” 7 And when he said this, a dispute developed between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. 8 (For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection or angel or spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.) 9 And there was loud shouting, and some of the scribes from the party of the Pharisees stood up and contended sharply, saying, “We find nothing wrong with this man! But what if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?” 10 And when the dispute became severe, the military tribune, fearing lest Paul be torn apart by them, ordered the detachment to go down, take him away from their midst, and bring him into the barracks. 11 And the next night the Lord stood by him and said, “Have courage, for as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.” 12 And when it was day, the Jews made a conspiracy and bound themselves under a curse, saying they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul. 13 Now there were more than forty who had made this conspiracy, 14 who went to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have bound ourselves under a curse to partake of nothing until we have killed Paul. 15 Therefore, now you along with the Sanhedrin explain to the military tribune that he should bring him down to you, as if you were going to determine more accurately the things concerning him. And we are ready to do away with him before he comes near.” 16 But when the son of Paul’s sister heard about the ambush, he came and entered into the barracks and reported it to Paul. 17 So Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Bring this young man to the military tribune, because he has something to report to him.” 18 So he took him and brought him to the military tribune and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.” 19 And the military tribune, taking hold of his hand and withdrawing privately, asked, “What is it that you have to report to me?” 20 And he said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you that you bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow, as if they were going to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him. 21 You therefore do not be persuaded by them, because more than forty men of their number are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have done away with him. And now they are ready, waiting for you to agree.” 22 So the military tribune sent the young man away, directing him, “Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me.” 23 And he summoned two of the centurions and said, “Make ready from the third hour of the night two hundred soldiers and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, in order that they may proceed as far as Caesarea. 24 And provide mounts so that they can put Paul on them and bring him safely to Felix the governor.” 25 He wrote a letter that had this form: 26 Claudius Lysias. To his excellency Governor Felix. Greetings! 27 This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the detachment and rescued him, because I learned that he was a Roman citizen. 28 And because I wanted to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin. 29 I found he was accused concerning controversial questions of their law, but having no charge deserving death or imprisonment. 30 And when it was made known to me there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you immediately, also ordering his accusers to speak against him before you. 31 Therefore the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him to Antipatris during the night. 32 And on the next day they let the horsemen go on with him, and they returned to the barracks. 33 The horsemen, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, also presented Paul to him. 34 So after reading the letter and asking what province he was from, and learning that he was from Cilicia, 35 he said, “I will give you a hearing whenever your accusers arrive also,” giving orders for him to be guarded in the praetorium of Herod.

Acts,"1 And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an attorney, a certain Tertullus, all of whom brought charges against Paul to the governor. 2 And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “We have experienced much peace through you, and reforms are taking place in this nation through your foresight. 3 Both in every way and everywhere we acknowledge this, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude. 4 But so that I may not impose on you for longer, I implore you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness. 5 For we have found this man to be a public menace and one who causes riots among all the Jews throughout the Roman Empire and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes, 6 who even attempted to desecrate the temple, and we arrested him. 8 When you yourself examine him you will be able to find out from him about all these things of which we are accusing him.” 9 And the Jews also joined in the attack, asserting these things were so. 10 And when the governor gestured for him to speak, Paul replied, “Because I know you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I defend myself cheerfully with respect to the things concerning myself. 11 You can ascertain that it has not been more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 12 And neither did they find me arguing with anyone or making a crowd develop in the temple courts nor in the synagogues nor throughout the city. 13 Nor can they prove the things to you concerning which they are now accusing me. 14 But I do confess this to you, that according to the Way (which they call a sect), so I worship the God of our fathers, believing all things that are in accordance with the law and that are written in the prophets, 15 having a hope in God which these men also themselves await: that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. 16 For this reason also I myself always do my best to have a clear conscience toward God and people. 17 So after many years, I came to practice charitable giving and offerings to my people, 18 in which they found me purified in the temple courts, not with a crowd or with a disturbance. 19 But there are some Jews from Asia who ought to be present before you and bring charges against me, if they have anything against me, 20 or these men themselves should say what crime they found when I stood before the Sanhedrin, 21 other than concerning this one declaration that I shouted while standing there before them: ‘I am being judged before you today concerning the resurrection of the dead!’ ” 22 But Felix, because he understood the facts concerning the Way more accurately, put them off, saying, “When Lysias the military tribune comes down, I will decide your case.” 23 He ordered the centurion for him to be guarded and to have some freedom, and in no way to prevent any of his own people from serving him. 24 And after some days, when Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and listened to him concerning faith in Christ Jesus. 25 And while he was discussing about righteousness and self control and the judgment that is to come, Felix became afraid and replied, “Go away for the present, and when I have an opportunity, I will summon you.” 26 At the same time he was also hoping that money would be given to him by Paul. For this reason also he sent for him as often as possible and talked with him. 27 And when two years had passed, Felix received as successor Porcius Festus. And because he wanted to do a favor for the Jews, Felix left Paul behind as a prisoner.

For this reason also he sent for him as often as possible and talked with him. 27 And when two years had passed, Felix received as successor Porcius Festus. And because he wanted to do a favor for the Jews, Felix left Paul behind as a prisoner. 1 Now when Festus set foot in the province, after three days he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. 2 And the chief priests and the most prominent men of the Jews brought charges against Paul to him, and were urging him, 3 asking for a favor against him, that he summon him to Jerusalem, because they were preparing an ambush to do away with him along the way. 4 Then Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and he himself was about to go there in a short time. 5 So he said, “Let those among you who are prominent go down with me, and if there is any wrong in the man, let them bring charges against him.” 6 And after he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. On the next day he sat down on the judgment seat and gave orders for Paul to be brought. 7 And when he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges that they were not able to prove, 8 while Paul said in his defense, “Neither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I sinned with reference to anything!” 9 But Festus, because he wanted to do a favor for the Jews, answered and said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be tried before me there concerning these things?” 10 But Paul said, “I am standing before the judgment seat of Caesar, where it is necessary for me to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well. 11 If then I am doing wrong and have done anything deserving death, I am not trying to avoid dying. But if there is nothing true of the things which these people are accusing me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!” 12 Then Festus, after discussing this with his council, replied, “You have appealed to Caesar—to Caesar you will go!” 13 Now after some days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to welcome Festus. 14 And while they were staying there many days, Festus laid out the case against Paul to the king, saying, “There is a certain man left behind by Felix as a prisoner, 15 concerning whom when I was in Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews presented evidence, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him. 16 To them I replied that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up any man before the one who had been accused met his accusers face to face and received an opportunity for a defense concerning the accusation. 17 Therefore, when they had assembled here, I made no delay; on the next day I sat down on the judgment seat and gave orders for the man to be brought. 18 When they stood up, his accusers began bringing no charge concerning him of the evil deeds that I was suspecting, 19 but they had some issues with him concerning their own religion, and concerning a certain Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul claimed to be alive. 20 And because I was at a loss with regard to the investigation concerning these things, I asked if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and to be judged there concerning these things. 21 But when Paul appealed that he be kept under guard for the decision of His Majesty the Emperor, I gave orders for him to be kept under guard until I could send him to Caesar.” 22 So Agrippa said to Festus, “I want to hear the man myself also.” “Tomorrow,” he said, “you will hear him.” 23 So on the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with great pageantry and entered into the audience hall, along with military tribunes and the most prominent men of the city.

Therefore I have brought him before you all—and especially before you, King Agrippa—so that after this preliminary hearing has taken place, I may have something to write. 27 For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not to indicate the charges against him.” 1 So Agrippa said to Paul, “It is permitted for you to speak for yourself.” Then Paul extended his hand and began to defend himself: 2 “Concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that before you I am about to defend myself today, 3 because you are especially acquainted with both all the customs and controversial questions with respect to the Jews.

Acts,"1 So Agrippa said to Paul, “It is permitted for you to speak for yourself.” Then Paul extended his hand and began to defend himself: 2 “Concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that before you I am about to defend myself today, 3 because you are especially acquainted with both all the customs and controversial questions with respect to the Jews. Therefore I beg you to listen to me with patience. 4 “Now all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth, that had taken place from the beginning among my own people and in Jerusalem, 5 having known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that in accordance with the strictest party of our religion I lived as a Pharisee. 6 And now I stand here on trial on the basis of hope in the promise made by God to our fathers, 7 to which our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly serve him night and day. Concerning this hope I am being accused by the Jews, O king! 8 Why is it thought incredible by you people that God raises the dead? 9 Indeed, I myself thought it was necessary to do many things opposed to the name of Jesus the Nazarene, 10 which I also did in Jerusalem, and not only did I lock up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being executed, I cast my vote against them. 11 And throughout all the synagogues I punished them often and tried to force them to blaspheme, and because I was enraged at them beyond measure, I was pursuing them even as far as to foreign cities. 12 In this activity I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and full power of the chief priests. 13 In the middle of the day along the road, O king, I saw a light from heaven, more than the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who were traveling with me. 14 And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Aramaic language, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads!’ 15 So I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. 16 But get up and stand on your feet, because for this reason I have appeared to you, to appoint you a servant and witness both to the things in which you saw me and to the things in which I will appear to you, 17 rescuing you from the people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you, 18 to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’ 19 “Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, 20 but to those in Damascus first, and in Jerusalem and all the region of Judea and to the Gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God, doing deeds worthy of repentance. 21 On account of these things the Jews seized me in the temple courts and were attempting to kill me. 22 Therefore I have experienced help from God until this day, and I stand here testifying to both small and great, saying nothing except what both the prophets and Moses have said were going to happen, 23 that the Christ was to suffer and that as the first of the resurrection from the dead, he was going to proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.” 24 And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “You are out of your mind, Paul! Your great learning is driving you insane!” 25 But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but am speaking words of truth and rationality. 26 For the king knows about these things, to whom also I am speaking freely, for I am not convinced that these things in any way have escaped his notice, because this was not done in a corner. 27 Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you believe.” 28 But Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time are you persuading me to become a Christian?” ",Acts 26:1-28,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/acts-261-28-294776/direct-download/thru-the-bible-with-j-_2012-08-17_acts-261-28_20120731180555.mp3
Acts,"29 And Paul replied, “I pray to God, whether in a short time or in a long time, not only you but also all those who are listening to me today may become such people as I also am, except for these bonds!” 30 Both the king and the governor got up, and Bernice and those who were sitting with them. 31 And as they were going out, they were talking to one another, saying, “This man is not doing anything deserving death or imprisonment.” 32 And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.” 1 And when it was decided that we would sail away to Italy, they handed over Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius of the Augustan Cohort. 2 And we went aboard a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to the places along the coast of Asia and put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us. 3 And on the next day, we put in at Sidon. And Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him to go to his friends to be cared for. 4 And from there we put out to sea and sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us. 5 And after we had sailed across the open sea along Cilicia and Pamphylia, we put in at Myra in Lycia. 6 And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board it. 7 And sailing slowly, in many days and with difficulty we came to Cnidus. Because the wind did not permit us to go further, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone. 8 And sailing along its coast with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near which was the town of Lasea. 9 And because considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous because even the Fast was already over, Paul strongly recommended, 10 saying to them, “Men, I perceive that the voyage is going to end with disaster and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives!” 11 But the centurion was convinced even more by the shipmaster and the shipowner than by what was said by Paul. 12 And because the harbor was unsuitable for spending the winter in, the majority decided on a plan to put out to sea from there, if somehow they could arrive at Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing toward the southwest and toward the northwest, to spend the winter there. 13 And when a southwest wind began to blow gently, because they thought they could accomplish their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed close along Crete.

Acts,"14 But not long afterward a wind like a hurricane, called the northeaster, rushed down from it. 15 And when the ship was caught and was not able to head into the wind, we gave way and were driven along. 16 And running under the lee of a certain small island called Cauda, we were able with difficulty to get the ship’s boat under control. 17 After hoisting it up, they made use of supports to undergird the ship. And because they were afraid lest they run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and thus were driven along. 18 And because we were violently battered by the storm, on the next day they began jettisoning the cargo, 19 and on the third day they threw overboard the gear of the ship with their own hands. 20 But when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and with not a little bad weather confronting us, finally all hope was abandoned that we would be saved. 21 And because many were experiencing lack of appetite, at that time Paul stood up in their midst and said, “Men, you ought to have followed my advice not to put out to sea from Crete, and thus avoided this damage and loss! 22 And now I urge you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life from among you, but only of the ship. 23 For this night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve came to me, 24 saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul! It is necessary for you to stand before Caesar, and behold, God has graciously granted you all who are sailing with you.’ 25 Therefore keep up your courage, men, for I believe God that it will be like this—according to the way it was told to me. 26 But it is necessary that we run aground on some island.” 27 And when the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven in the Adriatic Sea about the middle of the night, the sailors suspected they were approaching some land. 28 And taking soundings, they found twenty fathoms. So going on a little further and taking soundings again, they found fifteen fathoms. 29 And because they were afraid lest somewhere we run aground against rough places, they threw down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come. 30 And when the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship and were lowering the ship’s boat into the sea, pretending as if they were going to lay out anchors from the bow, 31 Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain with the ship, you cannot be saved!” 32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it fall away. 33 And until the day was about to come, Paul was urging them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day you have waited anxiously, and you have continued without eating, having taken nothing. 34 Therefore I urge you to take some food, for this is necessary for your preservation. For not a hair from your head will be lost.” 35 And after he said these things and took bread, he gave thanks to God in front of them all, and after breaking it, he began to eat.

Acts,"35 And after he said these things and took bread, he gave thanks to God in front of them all, and after breaking it, he began to eat. 36 So they all were encouraged and partook of food themselves. 37 (Now we were in all two hundred seventy six persons on the ship.) 38 And when they had eaten their fill of food, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea. 39 Now when day came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay having a beach, onto which they decided to run the ship ashore if they could. 40 And slipping the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes of the steering oars. And hoisting the foresail to the wind that was blowing, they held course for the beach. 41 But falling into a place of crosscurrents, they ran the ship aground. And the bow stuck fast and stayed immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the violence. 42 Now the plan of the soldiers was that they would kill the prisoners lest any escape by swimming away, 43 but the centurion, because he wanted to save Paul, prevented them from doing what they intended, and gave orders that those who were able to swim should jump in first to get to the land, 44 and then the rest, some of whom floated on planks and some of whom on anything that was from the ship. And in this way all were brought safely to the land. 1 And after we were brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta. 2 And the local inhabitants showed extraordinary kindness to us, for they lit a fire and welcomed us all, because of the rain that had begun and because of the cold. 3 And when Paul had gathered a large number of sticks and was placing them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand. 4 And when the local people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another, “Doubtless this man is a murderer whom, although he was rescued from the sea, Justice has not permitted to live!” 5 He, in turn, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm. 6 But they were expecting that he was going to swell up or suddenly to fall down dead. So after they had waited for a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and began saying that he was a god. 7 Now in the regions around that place were fields belonging to the chief official of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days. 8 And it happened that the father of Publius was lying down, afflicted with fever and dysentery. Paul went to him and after praying, he placed his hands on him and healed him. 9 And after this had taken place, the rest of those on the island who had diseases were coming and being healed also. 10 They also honored us with many honors, and when we were putting out to sea, they gave us the things we needed. 11 Now after three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered at the island, an Alexandrian one with the twin gods Castor and Pollux as its insignia. 12 And putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there three days. 13 From there we got underway and arrived at Rhegium, and after one day a south wind came up and on the second day we came to Puteoli, 14 where we found brothers, and were implored to stay with them seven days. And in this way we came to Rome. 15 And from there the brothers, when they heard the news about us, came to meet us as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns. When he saw them, Paul gave thanks to God and took courage. 16 And when we entered into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who was guarding him. 17 Now it happened that after three days, he called together those who were the most prominent of the Jews. And when they had assembled, he said to them, “Men and brothers, although I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, from Jerusalem I was delivered as a prisoner into the hands of the Romans, 18 who, when they had examined me, were wanting to release me, because there was no basis for an accusation worthy of death with me. 19 But because the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar (not as if I had any charge to bring against my own people). 20 Therefore for this reason I have requested to see you and to speak with you, for because of the hope of Israel I am wearing this chain!” 21 And they said to him, “We have received no letters about you from Judea, nor has any of the brothers come and reported or spoken anything evil about you. 22 But we would like to hear from you what you think, for concerning this sect it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.” 23 And when they had set a day with him, many more came to him at his lodging place, to whom he was explaining from early in the morning until evening, testifying about the kingdom of God and attempting to convince them about Jesus from both the law of Moses and the prophets. 24 And some were convinced by what was said, but others refused to believe. 25 So being in disagreement with one another, they began to leave after Paul made one statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through the prophet Isaiah to your fathers, 26 saying, ‘Go to this people and say, “You will keep on hearing and will never understand, and you will keep on seeing and will never perceive. 27 For the heart of this people has become dull, and with their ears they hear with difficulty, and they have shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them.” ’ 28 Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles. They also will listen!” 30 So he stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and welcomed all who came to him, 31 proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.

This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven like this will come back in the same way you saw him departing into heaven!” 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain that is called Olive Grove which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away. 13 And when they had entered, they went up to the upstairs room where they were staying—Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas son of James. 14 All these were busily engaged with one mind in prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers. 15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (and it was a crowd of persons of about one hundred twenty at the same place) and said, 16 “Men and brothers, it was necessary that the scripture be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit proclaimed beforehand through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus, 17 because he was counted among us and received a share in this ministry.” 18 (Now this man acquired a field for the wages of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines spilled out. 19 And it became known to all who live in Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own language “Akeldama,” that is, “Field of Blood.”) 20 “For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his residence become deserted, and let there be no one to live in it,’ and, ‘Let another person take his position.’ 21 Therefore it is necessary for one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us, 22 beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which he was taken up from us—one of these men must become a witness of his resurrection together with us.” 23 And they proposed two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was called Justus) and Matthias. 24 And they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show clearly which one of these two you have chosen 25 to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to depart to his own place.” 26 And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was added to serve with the eleven apostles.

Acts,"1 Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. 2 And a certain man was being carried who was lame from birth. He was placed every day at the gate of the temple called “Beautiful,” so that he could ask for charitable gifts from those who were going into the temple courts. 3 When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple courts, he began asking to receive alms. 4 And Peter looked intently at him, together with John, and said, “Look at us!” 5 So he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. 6 But Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you—in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk!” 7 And taking hold of him by the right hand, he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. 8 And leaping up, he stood and began walking around and entered into the temple courts with them, walking and leaping and praising God. 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God, 10 And they recognized him, that this one was the one who used to sit asking for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with awe and astonishment at what had happened to him. 11 And while he was holding fast to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon’s, utterly astonished. 12 And when he saw it, Peter replied to the people, “Men and Israelites, why are you astonished at this? Or why are you staring at us, as if by our own power or godliness we have made him walk? 13 The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and denied in the presence of Pilate, after he had decided to release him. 14 But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and demanded that a man—a murderer—be granted to you. 15 And you killed the originator of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses! 16 And on the basis of faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know, and the faith that is through him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all. 17 And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also. 18 But the things which God foretold through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he has fulfilled in this way. 19 Therefore repent and turn back, so that your sins may be blotted out, 20 so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and he may send the Christ appointed for you—Jesus, 21 whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things, about which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times. 22 Moses said, ‘The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You will listen to him in everything that he says to you. 23 And it will be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed utterly from the people.’ 24 And indeed, all the prophets from Samuel and all those who followed him have spoken about and proclaimed these days. 25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God ordained with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed.’ 26 God, after he had raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning each of you back from your wickedness!” ",Acts 3,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/acts-3-6238/direct-download/tbd20070711.mp3
Acts,"1 And while they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees approached them, 2 greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 3 And they laid hands on them and put them in custody until the next day, because it was already evening. 4 But many of those who listened to the message believed, and the number of the men was approximately five thousand. 5 And it happened that on the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes came together in Jerusalem, 6 and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all those who were from the high priest’s family. 7 And they made them stand in their midst and began to ask, “By what power or by what name did you do this?” 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders, 9 if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a sick man—by what means this man was healed—10 let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by him this man stands before you healthy! 11 This one is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, that has become the cornerstone. 12 And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven that is given among people by which we must be saved.” 13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were astonished, and recognized them, that they had been with Jesus. 14 And because they saw the man who had been healed standing there with them, they had nothing to say in return. 15 But after they had ordered them to go outside the Sanhedrin, they began to confer with one another, 16 saying, “What should we do with these men? For that a remarkable sign has taken place through them is evident to all those who live in Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny it! 17 But in order that it may not spread much further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more in this name to anyone at all.” 18 And they called them back and commanded them not to speak or to teach at all in the name of Jesus. 19 But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than God, you decide! 20 For we are not able to refrain from speaking about the things that we have seen and heard.” 21 So after threatening them further, they released them, finding no way to punish them on account of the people, because they were all praising God for what had happened. 22 For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old. 23 And when they were released, they went to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. 24 And when they heard it, they lifted their voices with one mind to God and said, “Master, you are the one who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them, 25 the one who said by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of our father David, your servant, ‘Why do the nations rage, and the peoples conspire in vain? 26 The kings of the earth stood opposed, and the rulers assembled together at the same place, against the Lord and against his Christ.’ 27 For in truth both Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, assembled together in this city against your holy servant Jesus whom you anointed, 28 to do all that your hand and plan had predestined to take place. 29 And now, Lord, concern yourself with their threats and grant your slaves to speak your message with all boldness, 30 as you extend your hand to heal and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.” 31 And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness. 32 Now the group of those who believed were one heart and soul, and no one said anything of what belonged to him was his own, but all things were theirs in common. 33 And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on them all. 34 For there was not even anyone needy among them, because all those who were owners of plots of land or houses were selling them and bringing the proceeds of the things that were sold 35 and placing them at the feet of the apostles. And it was being distributed to each as anyone had need. 36 So Joseph, who was called Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated “son of encouragement”), a Levite of Cyprus by nationality, 37 sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and placed it at the feet of the apostles.

Acts,"1 Now a certain man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property, 2 and he kept back for himself some of the proceeds, and his wife was aware of it. And he brought a certain part and placed it at the feet of the apostles. 3 But Peter said, “Ananias, for what reason has Satan filled your heart, that you lied to the Holy Spirit and kept back for yourself some of the proceeds of the piece of land? 4 When it remained to you, did it not remain yours? And when it was sold, was it at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to people, but to God!” 5 And when Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear came on all those who heard about it. 6 So the young men stood up, wrapped him up, and carried him out and buried him. 7 And it happened that there was an interval of about three hours, and his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 8 And Peter said to her, “Tell me whether you both were paid this much for the piece of land.” And she said, “Yes, this much.” 9 So Peter said to her, “How is it that it was agreed by you two to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out!” 10 And immediately she fell down at his feet and died. So when the young men came in, they found her dead, and carried her out and buried her with her husband. 11 And great fear came on the whole church and on all who heard about these things. 12 Now many signs and wonders were being performed among the people through the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon’s Portico. 13 And none of the rest dared to join them, but the people spoke highly of them. 14 And even more believers in the Lord were being added, large numbers of both men and women, 15 so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and put them on cots and mats so that when Peter came by, at least his shadow would fall on some of them. 16 And the people of the towns around Jerusalem also came together, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, who were all being healed. 17 Now the high priest rose up and all those who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy. 18 And they laid hands on the apostles and put them in the public prison. 19 But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison and led them out and said, 20 “Go and stand in the temple courts and proclaim to the people all the words of this life.” 21 And when they heard this, they entered at daybreak into the temple courts and began teaching. Now when the high priest and those with him arrived, they summoned the Sanhedrin—even the whole council of elders of the sons of Israel—and sent to the prison to have them brought. 22 But the officers who came did not find them in the prison, and they returned and reported, 23 saying, “We found the prison locked with all security and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!” 24 Now when both the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed concerning them, as to what this might be. 25 But someone came and reported to them, “Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple courts and teaching the people!” 26 Then the captain went with the officers and brought them, not with force (for they were afraid of the people, lest they be stoned by them). 27 And when they had brought them, they made them stand in the Sanhedrin, and the high priest put a question to them, 28 saying, “We strictly commanded you not to teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching! And you are intending to bring upon us the blood of this man!” 29 But Peter and the apostles answered and said, “It is necessary to obey God rather than men! 30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. 31 This one God has exalted to his right hand as Leader and Savior to grant repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 32 And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.” 33 Now when they heard this, they were infuriated, and were wanting to execute them. 34 But a certain man stood up in the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law respected by all the people, and gave orders to put the men outside for a short time. 35 And he said to them, “Men and Israelites, take care for yourselves what you are about to do to these men! 36 For before these days, Theudas rose up saying he was somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was executed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing. 37 After this man, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and caused people to follow him in revolt. And that one perished, and all who followed him were scattered. 38 And now I tell you, keep away from these men, and leave them alone, because if this plan or this matter is from people, it will be overthrown. 39 But if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest you even be found fighting against God.” So they were persuaded by him. 40 And they summoned the apostles, beat them, commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them. 41 So they went out from the presence of the Sanhedrin rejoicing, because they had been considered worthy to be dishonored for the sake of the name. 42 Every day, both in the temple courts and from house to house, they did not stop teaching and proclaiming the good news that the Christ was Jesus.

Acts,"1 Now in these days, as the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint arose by the Greek-speaking Jews against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food. 2 So the twelve summoned the community of disciples and said, “It is not desirable that we neglect the word of God to serve tables. 3 So, brothers, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and wisdom, whom we will put in charge of this need. 4 But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” 5 And the statement pleased the whole group, and they chose Stephen (a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit), and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus (a convert from Antioch), 6 whom they stood before the apostles. And they prayed and placed their hands on them. 7 And the word of God kept spreading, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem was increasing greatly, and a large number of priests began obeying the faith. 8 Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people. 9 But some of those from the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia, stood up and disputed with Stephen. 10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking. 11 Then they secretly instigated men who said, “We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God!” 12 And they incited the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came up and seized him and brought him to the Sanhedrin. 13 And they put forward false witnesses who said, “This man does not stop speaking words against the holy place and the law! 14 For we have heard him saying that this Nazarene Jesus will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses handed down to us.” 15 And as they looked intently at him, all those who were sitting in the Sanhedrin saw his face was like the face of an angel. 1 And the high priest said, “Is it so concerning these things?” 2 So he said, “Men—brothers and fathers—listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran, 3 and said to him, ‘Go out from your land and from your relatives and come to the land that I will show you.’ ",Acts 6:1-7:3,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/acts-61-73-6241/direct-download/tbd20070716.mp3
Acts,"1 And the high priest said, “Is it so concerning these things?” 2 So he said, “Men—brothers and fathers—listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran, 3 and said to him, ‘Go out from your land and from your relatives and come to the land that I will show you.’ 4 Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. And from there, after his father died, he caused him to move to this land in which you now live. 5 And he did not give him an inheritance in it—not even a footstep—and he promised to give it to him for his possession, and to his descendants after him, although he did not have a child. 6 But God spoke like this: ‘His descendants will be foreigners in a foreign land, and they will enslave them and mistreat them four hundred years, 7 and the nation that they will serve as slaves, I will judge,’ God said, ‘and after these things they will come out and will worship me in this place.’ 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision, and so he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac did so with Jacob, and Jacob did so with the twelve patriarchs. 9 And the patriarchs, because they were jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt. And God was with him, 10 and rescued him from all his afflictions and granted him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he appointed him ruler over Egypt and all his household. 11 And a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan and great affliction, and our fathers could not find food. 12 So when Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. 13 And on the second visit Joseph was made known to his brothers, and the family of Joseph became known to Pharaoh. 14 So Joseph sent and summoned his father Jacob and all his relatives, seventy-five persons in all. 15 And Jacob went down to Egypt and died, he and our fathers. 16 And they were brought back to Shechem and buried in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. 17 “But as the time of the promise that God had made to Abraham was drawing near, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt 18 until another king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph. 19 This man deceitfully took advantage of our people and mistreated our ancestors, causing them to abandon their infants so that they would not be kept alive. 20 At this time Moses was born, and he was beautiful to God. He was brought up for three months in his father’s house, 21 and when he was abandoned, the daughter of Pharaoh took him up and brought him up as her own son. 22 And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was powerful in his words and deeds. 23 “But when he was forty years old, it entered in his heart to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel. 24 And when he saw one of them being unjustly harmed, he defended him and avenged the one who had been oppressed by striking down the Egyptian. 25 And he thought his brothers would understand that God was granting deliverance to them by his hand, but they did not understand. 26 And on the following day, he made an appearance to them while they were fighting and was attempting to reconcile them in peace, saying, ‘Men and brothers, why are you doing wrong to one another?’ 27 But the one who was doing wrong to his neighbor pushed him aside, saying, ‘Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us? 28 You do not want to do away with me the same way you did away with the Egyptian yesterday, do you?’ 29 And at this statement, Moses fled and became a foreigner in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons. 30 “And when forty years had been completed, an angel appeared to him in the desert of Mount Sinai in the flame of a burning bush. 31 And when Moses saw it, he was astonished at the sight, and when he approached to look at it, the voice of the Lord came: 32 ‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob!’ So Moses began trembling and did not dare to look at it. 33 And the Lord said to him, ‘Untie the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground. 34 I have certainly seen the mistreatment of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.’ 35 This Moses whom they had repudiated, saying, ‘Who appointed you a ruler and a judge?’—this man God sent as both ruler and redeemer with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. 36 This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years. 37 “This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers.’ 38 This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and who with our fathers received living oracles to give to us, 39 to whom our fathers were not willing to become obedient, but rejected him and turned back in their hearts to Egypt, 40 saying to Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go on before us! For this Moses, who led us out from the land of Egypt—we do not know what has happened to him!’ 41 And they manufactured a calf in those days, and offered up a sacrifice to the idol, and began rejoicing in the works of their hands. 42 But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, just as it is written in the book of the prophets: ‘You did not bring offerings and sacrifices to me for forty years in the wilderness, did you, house of Israel? 43 And you took along the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan, the images that you made, to worship them, and I will deport you beyond Babylon!’ 44 The tabernacle of the testimony belonged to our fathers in the wilderness, just as the one who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the design that he had seen, 45 and which, after receiving it in turn, our fathers brought in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out from the presence of our fathers, until the days of David, 46 who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob. 47 But Solomon built a house for him. 48 But the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands, just as the prophet says, 49 ‘Heaven is my throne and earth is the footstool for my feet. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest? 50 Did not my hand make all these things?’ 51 “You stiff-necked people and uncircumcised in hearts and in your ears! You constantly resist the Holy Spirit! As your fathers did, so also do you! 52 Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand about the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become, 53 you who received the law by directions of angels and have not observed it!” 54 Now when they heard these things, they were infuriated in their hearts and gnashed their teeth at him. 55 But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 56 And he said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” 57 But crying out with a loud voice, they stopped their ears and rushed at him with one purpose. 58 And after they had driven him out of the city, they began to stone him, and the witnesses laid aside their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul. 59 And they kept on stoning Stephen as he was calling out and saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!” 60 And falling to his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them!” And after he said this, he fell asleep.

Acts,"1 And Saul was agreeing with his murder. Now there happened on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. 2 And devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him. 3 But Saul was attempting to destroy the church. Entering house after house, he dragged off both men and women and delivered them to prison. 4 Now those who had been scattered went about proclaiming the good news of the word. 5 And Philip came down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming the Christ to them. 6 And the crowds with one mind were paying attention to what was being said by Philip, as they heard him and saw the signs that he was performing. 7 For many of those who had unclean spirits, they were coming out of them, crying out with a loud voice, and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed. 8 And there was great joy in that city. 9 Now a certain man named Simon had been in the city practicing magic and astonishing the people of Samaria, saying he was someone great. 10 They were all paying attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is the power of God that is called ‘Great.’ ” 11 And they were paying attention to him because for a long time he had astonished them with his magic. 12 But when they believed Philip as he was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were being baptized. 13 And Simon himself also believed, and after he was baptized he was keeping close company with Philip. And when he saw the signs and great miracles that were taking place, he was astonished. 14 Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, 15 who went down and prayed for them so that they would receive the Holy Spirit. 16 (For he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 17 Then they placed their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. 18 Now Simon, when he saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, offered them money, 19 saying, “Give to me also this power, so that whomever I place my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit!” 20 But Peter said to him, “May your silver be destroyed along with you, because you thought you could acquire the gift of God by means of money! 21 You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart is not right before God. 22 Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and ask the Lord if perhaps the intent of your heart may be forgiven you!” 23 For I see you are in a state of bitter envy and bound by unrighteousness.” 24 But Simon answered and said, “You pray to the Lord for me so that nothing of what you have said will come upon me.” 25 So when they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they turned back toward Jerusalem, and were proclaiming the good news to many villages of the Samaritans. 26 Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Get up and go toward the south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a desert road.)

Entering house after house, he dragged off both men and women and delivered them to prison. 4 Now those who had been scattered went about proclaiming the good news of the word. 5 And Philip came down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming the Christ to them. 6 And the crowds with one mind were paying attention to what was being said by Philip, as they heard him and saw the signs that he was performing. 7 For many of those who had unclean spirits, they were coming out of them, crying out with a loud voice, and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed. 8 And there was great joy in that city. 9 Now a certain man named Simon had been in the city practicing magic and astonishing the people of Samaria, saying he was someone great. 10 They were all paying attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is the power of God that is called ‘Great.’ ” 11 And they were paying attention to him because for a long time he had astonished them with his magic. 12 But when they believed Philip as he was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were being baptized. 13 And Simon himself also believed, and after he was baptized he was keeping close company with Philip. And when he saw the signs and great miracles that were taking place, he was astonished. 14 Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, 15 who went down and prayed for them so that they would receive the Holy Spirit. 16 (For he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 17 Then they placed their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. 18 Now Simon, when he saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, offered them money, 19 saying, “Give to me also this power, so that whomever I place my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit!” 20 But Peter said to him, “May your silver be destroyed along with you, because you thought you could acquire the gift of God by means of money! 21 You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart is not right before God. 22 Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and ask the Lord if perhaps the intent of your heart may be forgiven you!” 23 For I see you are in a state of bitter envy and bound by unrighteousness.” 24 But Simon answered and said, “You pray to the Lord for me so that nothing of what you have said will come upon me.” 25 So when they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they turned back toward Jerusalem, and were proclaiming the good news to many villages of the Samaritans. 26 Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Get up and go toward the south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a desert road.) 27 And he got up and went, and behold, there was a man, an Ethiopian eunuch (a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasury) who had come to worship in Jerusalem 28 and was returning and sitting in his chariot, and reading aloud the prophet Isaiah. 29 And the Spirit said to Philip, “Approach and join this chariot.” 30 So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading aloud Isaiah the prophet and said, “So then, do you understand what you are reading?” 31 And he said, “So how could I, unless someone will guide me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 32 Now the passage of scripture that he was reading aloud was this: “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth. 33 In his humiliation justice was taken from him. Who can describe his descendants? For his life was taken away from the earth.” 34 And the eunuch answered and said to Philip, “I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this—about himself or about someone else?” 35 So Philip opened his mouth and beginning from this scripture, proclaimed the good news to him about Jesus. 36 And as they were traveling down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?” 38 And he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water—Philip and the eunuch—and he baptized him. 39 And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him any longer, for he went on his way rejoicing. 40 But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea. 1 But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest 2 and asked for letters from him to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, both men and women, he could bring them tied up to Jerusalem. 3 Now as he proceeded, it happened that when he approached Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. 4 And falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” 5 So he said, “Who are you, Lord?” And he said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting! 6 But get up and enter into the city, and it will be told to you what you must do.” 7 (Now the men who were traveling together with him stood speechless, because they heard the voice but saw no one.) 8 So Saul got up from the ground, but although his eyes were open he could see nothing. And leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus. 9 And he was unable to see for three days, and he did not eat or drink. 10 Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias!” And he said, “Behold, here I am, Lord!” 11 And the Lord said to him, “Get up, go to the street called ‘Straight’ and in the house of Judas look for a man named Saul from Tarsus. For behold, he is praying, 12 and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and placing hands on him so that he may regain his sight.” ",Acts 8:2-9:12,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/acts-82-912-6244/direct-download/tbd20070719.mp3

And he was with the disciples in Damascus several days. 20 And immediately he began proclaiming Jesus in the synagogues: “This one is the Son of God!” 21 And all who heard him were amazed, and were saying, “Is this not the one who was wreaking havoc in Jerusalem on those who call upon this name, and had come here for this reason, that he could bring them tied up to the chief priests?” 22 But Saul was increasing in strength even more, and was confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that this one is the Christ. 23 And when many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted to do away with him. 24 But their plot became known to Saul, and they were also watching the gates both day and night so that they could do away with him. 25 But his disciples took him at night and let him down through the wall by lowering him in a basket. 26 And when he arrived in Jerusalem, he was attempting to associate with the disciples, and they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe that he was a disciple. 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus. 28 And he was going in and going out among them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. 29 And he was speaking and debating with the Greek-speaking Jews, but they were trying to do away with him. 30 And when the brothers found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus. 31 Then the church throughout all of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being strengthened. And living in the fear of the Lord and the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, it was increasing in numbers. 32 Now it happened that as Peter was traveling through all the places, he also came down to the saints who lived in Lydda. 33 And he found there a certain man named Aeneas who was paralyzed, who had been lying on a mat for eight years. 34 And Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you! Get up and make your bed yourself!” And immediately he got up. 35 And all those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him, who all indeed turned to the Lord. 36 Now in Joppa there was a certain female disciple named Tabitha (which translated means “Dorcas”). She was full of good deeds and charitable giving which she was constantly doing. 37 Now it happened that in those days after becoming sick, she died. And after washing her, they placed her in an upstairs room. 38 And because Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, when they heard that Peter was in Lydda, sent two men to him, urging, “Do not delay to come to us!” ",Acts 9:13-38,http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/acts-913-38-6245/direct-download/tbd20070720.mp3

And he was with the disciples in Damascus several days. 20 And immediately he began proclaiming Jesus in the synagogues: “This one is the Son of God!” 21 And all who heard him were amazed, and were saying, “Is this not the one who was wreaking havoc in Jerusalem on those who call upon this name, and had come here for this reason, that he could bring them tied up to the chief priests?” 22 But Saul was increasing in strength even more, and was confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that this one is the Christ. 23 And when many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted to do away with him. 24 But their plot became known to Saul, and they were also watching the gates both day and night so that they could do away with him. 25 But his disciples took him at night and let him down through the wall by lowering him in a basket. 26 And when he arrived in Jerusalem, he was attempting to associate with the disciples, and they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe that he was a disciple. 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus. 28 And he was going in and going out among them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. 29 And he was speaking and debating with the Greek-speaking Jews, but they were trying to do away with him. 30 And when the brothers found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus. 31 Then the church throughout all of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being strengthened. And living in the fear of the Lord and the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, it was increasing in numbers. 32 Now it happened that as Peter was traveling through all the places, he also came down to the saints who lived in Lydda. 33 And he found there a certain man named Aeneas who was paralyzed, who had been lying on a mat for eight years. 34 And Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you! Get up and make your bed yourself!” And immediately he got up. 35 And all those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him, who all indeed turned to the Lord. 36 Now in Joppa there was a certain female disciple named Tabitha (which translated means “Dorcas”). She was full of good deeds and charitable giving which she was constantly doing. 37 Now it happened that in those days after becoming sick, she died. And after washing her, they placed her in an upstairs room. 38 And because Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, when they heard that Peter was in Lydda, sent two men to him, urging, “Do not delay to come to us!” 39 So Peter got up and accompanied them. When he arrived, they brought him up to the upstairs room, and all the widows came to him, weeping and showing him tunics and other clothing that Dorcas used to make while she was with them. 40 But Peter sent them all outside, and, falling to his knees, he prayed. And turning toward the body, he said, “Tabitha, get up!” And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 41 And he gave her his hand and raised her up. And he called the saints and the widows and presented her alive. 42 And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. 43 And it happened that he stayed many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner. 1 Now there was a certain man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Cohort, 2 devout and fearing God together with all his household, doing many charitable deeds for the people and praying to God continually. 3 About the ninth hour of the day, he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, “Cornelius.” 4 And he stared at him and became terrified and said, “What is it, Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your charitable deeds have gone up for a memorial offering before God. 5 And now, send men to Joppa and summon a certain Simon, who is also called Peter. 6 This man is staying as a guest with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.” 7 And when the angel who spoke to him departed, he summoned two of the household slaves and a devout soldier from those who attended him, 8 and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa. 9 And the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about the sixth hour. 10 And he became hungry and wanted to eat. But while they were preparing the food, a trance came over him. 11 And he saw heaven opened and an object something like a large sheet coming down, being let down to the earth by its four corners, 12 in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the sky. 13 And a voice came to him, “Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!” 14 But Peter said, “Certainly not, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common and unclean!” 15 And the voice came again to him for the second time: “The things which God has made clean, you must not consider unclean!” 16 And this happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into heaven. 17 Now while Peter was greatly perplexed within himself as to what the vision that he had seen might be, behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having found the house of Simon by asking around, stood at the gate. 18 And they called out and asked if Simon who was also called Peter was staying there as a guest. 19 And while Peter was reflecting about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, men are looking for you. 20 But get up, go down, and go with them—not hesitating at all, because I have sent them.” 21 So Peter went down to the men and said, “Behold, I am he whom you are looking for! What is the reason for which you have come?” 22 And they said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man—and well spoken of by the whole nation of the Jews—was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear words from you.” 23 So he invited them in and entertained them as guests, and on the next day he got up and went away with them. And some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him. 24 And on the next day he entered into Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends. 25 So it happened that when Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him. 26 But Peter helped him up, saying, “Get up! I myself am also a man!” 27 And as he conversed with him, he went in and found many people gathered. 28 And he said to them, “You know that it is forbidden for a Jewish man to associate with or to approach a foreigner. And to me God has shown that I should call no man common or unclean.

And to me God has shown that I should call no man common or unclean. 29 Therefore—and without raising any objection—I came when I was sent for. So I ask for what reason you sent for me.” 30 And Cornelius said, “Four days ago at this hour, the ninth, I was praying in my house. And behold, a man in shining clothing stood before me 31 and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your charitable deeds have been remembered before God. 32 Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon who is also called Peter. This man is staying as a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. 33 Therefore I sent for you at once, and you were kind enough to come. So now we all are present before God to hear all the things that have been commanded to you by the Lord.” 34 So Peter opened his mouth and said, “In truth I understand that God is not one who shows partiality, 35 but in every nation the one who fears him and who does what is right is acceptable to him. 36 As for the message that he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ—this one is Lord of all—37 you know the thing that happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism that John proclaimed: 38 Jesus of Nazareth—how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him. 39 And we are witnesses of all the things that he did both in the land of the Judeans and in Jerusalem, whom they also executed by hanging him on a tree. 40 God raised this one up on the third day and granted that he should become visible, 41 not to all the people but to us who had been chosen beforehand by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 42 And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify solemnly that this one is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and of the dead. 43 To this one all the prophets testify, that through his name everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins.” 44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who were listening to the message. 45 And those believers from the circumcision who had accompanied Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles, 46 for they heard them speaking in tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter said, 47 “Surely no one can withhold the water for these people to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did!” 48 So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days. 1 Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had accepted the word of God. 2 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision took issue with him, 3 saying, “You went to men who were uncircumcised and ate with them!” 4 But Peter began and explained it to them in an orderly sequence, saying, 5 “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision—an object something like a large sheet coming down, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came to me. 6 As I looked intently into it, I was considering it, and I saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild animals and the reptiles and the birds of the sky. 7 And I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!’ 8 But I said, ‘Certainly not, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has ever entered into my mouth!’ 9 But the voice replied from heaven for the second time, ‘The things which God has made clean, you must not consider unclean!’ 10 And this happened three times, and everything was pulled up into heaven again. 11 And behold, at once three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea approached the house in which we were staying. 12 And the Spirit told me to accompany them, not hesitating at all. So these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the man’s house. 13 And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is also called Peter, 14 who will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.’ 15 And as I was beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as also on us at the beginning. 16 And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ 17 Therefore if God gave them the same gift as also to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to hinder God?” 18 And when they heard these things, they became silent and praised God, saying, “Then God has granted the repentance leading to life to the Gentiles also!” 19 Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, proclaiming the message to no one except Jews alone. 20 But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they came to Antioch, began to speak to the Hellenists also, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus. 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord. 22 And the report came to the attention of the church that was in Jerusalem about them, and they sent out Barnabas as far as Antioch, 23 who, when he arrived and saw the grace of God, rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with devoted hearts, 24 because he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a large number were added to the Lord. 25 So he departed for Tarsus to look for Saul. 26 And when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it happened to them also that they met together for a whole year with the church and taught a large number of people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians. 27 Now in those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 28 And one of them named Agabus stood up and indicated by the Spirit that a great famine was about to come over the whole inhabited earth (which took place in the time of Claudius). 29 So from the disciples, according to their ability to give, each one of them determined to send financial aid for support to the brothers who lived in Judea, 30 which they also did, sending the aid to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.

Acts,"1 Now at that time, Herod the king laid hands on some of those from the church to harm them. 2 So he executed James the brother of John with a sword. 3 And when he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (Now this was during the feast of Unleavened Bread.) 4 After he had arrested him, he also put him in prison, handing him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out for public trial after the Passover. 5 Thus Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer was fervently being made to God by the church for him. 6 Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards before the door were watching the prison. 7 And behold, an angel of the Lord stood near him, and a light shone in the prison cell. And striking Peter’s side, he woke him up, saying, “Get up quickly!” And his chains fell off of his hands. 8 And the angel said to him, “Gird yourself and put on your sandals!” And he did so. And he said to him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me!” 9 And he went out and was following him. And he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but was thinking he was seeing a vision. 10 And after they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened for them by itself, and they went out and went forward along one narrow street, and at once the angel departed from him. 11 And when Peter came to himself, he said, “Now I know truly that the Lord has sent out his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and all that the Jewish people expected!” 12 And when he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John (who is also called Mark), where many people were gathered together and were praying. 13 And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a female slave named Rhoda came up to answer. 14 And recognizing Peter’s voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing at the gate. 15 But they said to her, “You are out of your mind!” But she kept insisting it was so. And they kept saying, “It is his angel!” 16 But Peter was continuing to knock, and when they opened the door they saw him and were astonished. 17 But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he related to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, “Report these things to James and to the brothers,” and he departed and went to another place. 18 Now when day came, there was not a little commotion among the soldiers as to what then had become of Peter. 19 And when Herod had searched for him and did not find him, he questioned the guards and ordered that they be led away to execution. And he came down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there. 20 Now he was very angry with the Tyrians and Sidonians. So they came to him with one purpose, and after persuading Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country was supported with food from the king’s country. 21 So on an appointed day Herod, after putting on royal clothing and sitting down on the judgment seat, began to deliver a public address to them. 22 But the people began to call out loudly, “The voice of a god and not of a man!” 23 And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down because he did not give the glory to God. And he was eaten by worms and died. 24 But the word of God kept on increasing and multiplying. 25 So Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem when they had completed their service, having taken along with them John (who is also called Mark).

Acts,"1 Now there were prophets and teachers in Antioch in the church that was there: Barnabas, and Simeon (who was called Niger), and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen (a close friend of Herod the tetrarch), and Saul. 2 And while they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart now for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” 3 Then, after they had fasted and prayed and placed their hands on them, they sent them away. 4 Therefore, sent out by the Holy Spirit, they came down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed away to Cyprus. 5 And when they came to Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they also had John as assistant. 6 And when they had crossed over the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus,7 who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and wished to hear the word of God. 8 But Elymas the magician (for his name is translated in this way) opposed them, attempting to turn the proconsul away from the faith. 9 But Saul (also called Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him 10 and said, “O you who are full of all deceit and of all unscrupulousness, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness! Will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord! 11 And now behold, the hand of the Lord is against you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a while. And immediately mist and darkness fell over him, and he was going around looking for people to lead him by the hand. 12 Then when the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, because he was astounded at the teaching about the Lord. 13 Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia, but John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem. 14 And they went on from Perga and arrived at Pisidian Antioch. And they entered into the synagogue on the day of the Sabbath and sat down. 15 So after the reading from the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, “Men and brothers, if there is any message of exhortation by you for the people, say it.” 16 So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand, he said, “Israelite men, and those who fear God, listen! 17 The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. 18 And for a period of time of about forty years, he put up with them in the wilderness. 19 And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave their land to his people as an inheritance. 20 This took about four hundred and fifty years. And after these things, he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. 21 And then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. 22 And after removing him, he raised up David for their king, about whom he also said, testifying, ‘I have found David the son of Jesse to be a man in accordance with my heart, who will carry out all my will.’ 23 From the descendants of this man, according to his promise, God brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus. 24 Before his coming John had publicly proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 25 But while John was completing his mission, he said, ‘What do you suppose me to be? I am not he! But behold, one is coming after me of whom I am not worthy to untie the sandals of his feet!’ 26 “Men and brothers, sons of the family of Abraham and those among you who fear God—to us the message of this salvation has been sent! 27 For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize this one, and the voices of the prophets that are read on every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him. 28 And although they found no charge worthy of death, they asked Pilate that he be executed. 29 And when they had carried out all the things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree and placed him in a tomb. 30 But God raised him from the dead, 31 who appeared for many days to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem—who are now his witnesses to the people. 32 And we proclaim the good news to you: that the promise that was made to the fathers, 33 this promise God has fulfilled to our children by raising Jesus, as it is also written in the second psalm, ‘You are my Son; today I have fathered you.’ 34 But that he has raised him from the dead, no more going to return to decay, he has spoken in this way: ‘I will give you the reliable divine decrees of David.’ 35 Therefore he also says in another psalm, ‘You will not permit your Holy One to experience decay.’ 36 For David, after serving the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was buried with his fathers, and experienced decay. 37 But he whom God raised up did not experience decay. 38 “Therefore let it be known to you, men and brothers, that through this one forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, 39 by this one everyone who believes is justified! 40 Watch out, therefore, lest what is stated by the prophets come upon you: 41 ‘Look, you scoffers, and be astonished and perish! For I am doing a work in your days, a work that you would never believe even if someone were to tell it to you.’ ” 42 And as they were going out, they began urging that these things be spoken about to them on the next Sabbath. 43 And after the synagogue had broken up, many of the Jews and the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who were speaking to them and were persuading them to continue in the grace of God. 44 And on the coming Sabbath, nearly the whole city came together to hear the word of the Lord. 45 But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and began contradicting what was being said by Paul by reviling him. 46 Both Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly and said, “It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you, since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life! Behold, we are turning to the Gentiles! 47 For so the Lord has commanded us: ‘I have appointed you to be a light for the Gentiles, that you would bring salvation to the end of the earth.’ 48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they began to rejoice and to glorify the word of the Lord. And all those who were designated for eternal life believed. 49 So the word of the Lord was carried through the whole region. 50 But the Jews incited the devout women of high social standing and the most prominent men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them out of their district. 51 So after shaking off the dust from their feet against them, they went to Iconium. 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

Acts,"1 Now it happened that in Iconium they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a way that a large number of both Jews and Greeks believed. 2 But the Jews who were disobedient stirred up and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers. 3 So they stayed there for a considerable time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who testified to the message of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be performed through their hands. 4 But the population of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews and some with the apostles. 5 So when an inclination took place on the part of both the Gentiles and the Jews, together with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them, 6 they became aware of it and fled to the Lycaonian cities—Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding region. 7 And there they were continuing to proclaim the good news. 8 And in Lystra a certain man was sitting powerless in his feet, lame from birth, who had never walked. 9 This man listened while Paul was speaking. Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be healed, 10 said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet!” And he leaped up and began walking. 11 And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices in the Lycaonian language, saying, “The gods have become like men and have come down to us!” 12 And they began calling Barnabas Zeus and Paul Hermes, because he was the principal speaker. 13 And the priest of the temple of Zeus that was just outside the city brought bulls and garlands to the gates and was wanting to offer sacrifice, along with the crowds. 14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about it, they tore their clothing and rushed out into the crowd, shouting 15 and saying, “Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men with the same nature as you, proclaiming the good news that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things that are in them—16 who in generations that are past permitted all the nations to go their own ways. 17 And yet he did not leave himself without witness by doing good, giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying you with food and your hearts with gladness.” 18 And although they said these things, only with difficulty did they dissuade the crowds from offering sacrifice to them. 19 But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium, and when they had won over the crowds and stoned Paul, they dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead. 20 But after the disciples surrounded him, he got up and went into the city. And on the next day he departed with Barnabas for Derbe. 21 And after they had proclaimed the good news in that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, 22 strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith and saying, “Through many persecutions it is necessary for us to enter into the kingdom of God.” 23 And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, after praying with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord, in whom they had believed. 24 And they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. 25 And after they proclaimed the message in Perga, they went down to Attalia, 26 and from there they sailed away to Antioch where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had completed. 27 And when they arrived and called the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles. 28 And they stayed no little time with the disciples.
